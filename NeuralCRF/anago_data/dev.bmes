a	O

also	O

this	O

It	O
was	O
contended	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Daphtary	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
production	O
was	O
to	O
constitute	O
``	O

''	O
a	O
process	O

we	O

no	O

imposed	O
on	O

``	O

in	O

Similarly	O
it	O
was	O
argued	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Paalkhivala	O
that	O
the	O
manufacture	O
of	O
gold	O
ornaments	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
industry	O
because	O
it	O
required	O
application	O
of	O
individual	O
art	O
and	O
craftsmanship	O
and	O
aesthetic	O
skill	O
.	O

But	O
mere	O
use	O
of	O
skill	O
or	O

is	O
not	O
a	O
decisive	O
factor	O
and	O
will	O
not	O
take	O
the	O

out	O
of	O
the	O
ambit	O
of	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
well	O
settled	O
that	O
the	O
entries	O
in	O
the	O
three	O
lists	O
are	O
only	O
legislative	O
heads	O

fields	O
of	O

they	O
demarcate	O
the	O
area	O
over	O
which	O
the	O
appropriate	O
legislature	O
can	O
operate	O

The	O
legislative	O
entries	O
must	O
be	O
given	O
a	O
large	O
and	O
liberal	O
interpretation	B-LEG
,	O
the	O
reason	O
being	O
that	O
the	O
allocation	O
of	O
subjects	O
to	O
the	O
lists	O
is	O
not	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
scientific	O

definition	B-LEG

is	O
a	O
mere	O
enumeration	O

not	O

however	O

necessary	O

of	O
this	O

But	O
we	O
are	O
satisfied	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
that	O
the	O
manufacture	O
of	O
gold	O
ornaments	O
by	O
goldsmiths	O

India	O
is	O
a	O
``	O

``	O

in	O
the	O
appropriate	O

It	O
follows	O

therefore	O
that	O

A	O

why	O
the	O

do	O
not	O

It	O
is	O

to	O

an	O
interpretation	B-LEG

would	O

the	O

from	O

The	O
main	O

the	O

In	O

no	O

the	O
Constitution	O

that	O
the	O

thus	O
``	O

within	O
the	O

of	O

of	O

I	O
under	O
which	O
the	O

According	O
to	O
Mr.	O

the	O

Mr.	O
Dwivedi	O
's	O
further	O
contention	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
legislative	O
Entry	O

be	O
so	O
interpreted	O
so	O
as	O

entry	O

the	O

list	O
or	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
list	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O

expression	O
``	O

According	O
to	O
Mr.	O

that	O

Applying	O
the	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
logical	O
to	O
hold	O
that	O
the	O

whether	O

of	O

The	O
aforesaid	O
provisions	O
show	O
two	O
aspects	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
insurer	O
has	O
only	O
statutory	O
defences	O
available	O
as	O

in	O
Sub-section	O
(	O
2	O
)	O
of	O
Section	O
149	O
of	O
1988	O
Act	O
and	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
Tribunal	O
is	O
of	O
the	O
view	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
collusion	O
between	O
the	O
claimant	B-LEG
and	O
the	O
insured	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
insured	O
does	O
not	O
contest	O
the	O
claim	B-LEG
,	O
the	O
insurer	O
can	O
be	O
made	O
a	O
party	O
and	O
on	O
such	O
impleadment	B-LEG
the	O
insurer	O
shall	O
have	O
all	O
defenses	O
available	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
comes	O
the	O
provisions	O
of	O
Section	O
173	O
which	O
provides	O
for	O
an	O
appeal	O
against	O
the	O
award	B-LEG
given	O
by	O
the	O
Tribunal	O
.	O

Under	O
Section	O
173	O
,	O
any	B-LEG
person	I-LEG
aggrieved	O
by	O
an	O
award	B-LEG
is	O
entitled	O
to	O
prefer	O
an	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
.	O

Very	O
often	O
the	O
question	O
has	O
arisen	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
an	O
insurer	O
is	O
entitled	O
to	O
file	O
an	O
appeal	O
on	O
the	O
grounds	O
available	O
to	O
the	O

either	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
collusion	O
between	O
the	O
claimants	O
and	O
the	O
insured	O
or	O
when	O
the	O
insured	O
has	O
not	O
filed	O
an	O
appeal	O
before	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
questioning	O
the	O
quantum	O
of	O
compensation	B-LEG
.	O

The	O
consistent	O
view	O
of	O
this	O
Court	O
had	O
been	O
that	O
the	O
insurer	O
has	O
no	O
right	O
to	O
file	O
an	O

to	O

that	O

urged	O
that	O

finding	B-LEG
of	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
landlord	B-LEG

transferred	O
the	O

The	O
contention	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
that	O
he	O

Bajrang	O

,	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
landlord	B-LEG

Surprisingly	O

on	O

we	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
case	B-LEG

up	O
by	O
the	O
respondent	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
executed	B-LEG
an	O
agreement	B-LEG

We	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
no	O

It	O

not	O
stand	O
to	O

why	O
this	O

The	O
only	O
case	O
put	O
forth	O
by	O

is	O
that	O

Assuming	O
that	O
it	O

it	O
can	O
not	O

a	O

the	O

We	O

What	O
intrigues	O
us	O
in	O
this	O

is	O
the	O
failure	O
of	O

to	O

himself	O

either	O

Coming	O
to	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PWs.3	O

,	O
we	O
notice	O
they	O

the	O

Gochi	O
though	O
they	O
have	O
every	O

to	O

Therefore	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
of	O

,	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
chance	O

We	O
also	O
do	O
not	O
find	O
any	O
special	O
reason	O
for	O
these	O
2	O
witnesses	O
to	O
have	O
accompanied	O
the	O

when	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Police	O

to	O
lodge	O
a	O

It	O
is	O
rather	O
unusual	O
for	O
a	O
person	O
to	O
take	O
with	O
him	O
two	O
young	O
girls	O
to	O
a	O
Police	O

at	O

No	O

has	O
been	O
given	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
to	O
establish	O
this	O
unusual	O
conduct	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
notice	O
from	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
these	O
2	O
witnesses	O
who	O
have	O
stated	O
that	O
at	O
first	O
all	O
the	O
accused	O
persons	O
were	O
hiding	O
in	O
a	O
Nullah	O
,	O
obviously	O
meaning	O
thereby	O
the	O
accused	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
disclose	O
their	O
identities	O
.	O

If	O
that	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
observed	O
by	O
the	O
learned	O
Sessions	O
Judge	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
very	O
well	O
shot	O
the	O
deceased	O
from	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
hiding	O
;	O
more	O
so	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
the	O
appellant	O
being	O
a	O
policeman	O
,	O
used	O
to	O
firearms	O
,	O
could	O
have	O
very	O
well	O
shot	O
at	O
and	O
killed	O
the	O
deceased	O
from	O
where	O
he	O
was	O
hiding	O
.	O

In	O
that	O
background	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
unable	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
version	O
of	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
witnesses	O
when	O
they	O
also	O
said	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
4	O
accused	O
persons	O
suddenly	O
appeared	O
from	O
their	O
hiding	O
and	O
came	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
,	O
waylaid	O
him	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
dead	O
.	O

As	O
observed	O
by	O
learned	O
Sessions	O
Judge	O
,	O
this	O
sounds	O
rather	O
unusual	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
these	O
eye	B-LEG
witnesses	O
shows	O
that	O
A-1	O
first	O
pulled	O
the	O
trigger	O
of	O
his	O
revolver	O
which	O
did	O
not	O
fire	O
then	O
this	O
appellant	O
shot	O
at	O
the	O
deceased	O
with	O
his	O
.12	O
bore	O
gun	O
on	O
his	O
chest	O
.	O

At	O
one	O
stage	O
these	O
witnesses	O
say	O
that	O
deceased	O
was	O
shot	O
at	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
standing	O
;	O
at	O
another	O
stage	O
they	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
pulled	O
down	O
by	O
A-2	O
and	O
A-3	O
who	O
held	O
his	O
hands	O
and	O
was	O
then	O
shot	O
at	O
.	O

These	O
contradictions	O
also	O
throw	O
a	O
doubt	O
in	O

to	O
the	O
actual	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
accused	O
attack	O
the	O
deceased	O

Then	O
as	O
observed	O
by	O

it	O
is	O
highly	O
unnatural	O
for	O
A-2	O
and	O

to	O
have	O
held	O
the	O
deceased	O
at	O
such	O
a	O

while	O
the	O

shot	O
at	O
him	O
with	O
the	O

which	O
sprays	O
pellets	O

As	O
observed	O
by	O
the	O
learned	O
Sessions	O
Judge	O
,	O
no	O
sensible	O
person	O
would	O
incur	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
standing	O

the	O

when	O

sufficient	O
suspicion	O
in	O
our	O

to	O
accept	O
their	O
evidence	O

Then	O
we	O
notice	O
even	O
the	O
High	O

has	O
rejected	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
these	O
witnesses	O
in	O

to	O
A-2	O
and	O
A-3	O

We	O
do	O
not	O
find	O
from	O
the	O
judgment	O
of	O
the	O
High	O

any	O
special	O
reason	O
why	O
their	O

From	O
the	O
aforesaid	O

it	O
is	O
graphic	O
that	O

the	O

there	O

it	O
to	O

if	O

The	O

and	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O

circumstantial	B-LEG
evidence	I-LEG
against	O
the	O
