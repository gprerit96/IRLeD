s. rajendra babu j. this appeal is filed under section of the special court trial of offences relating to transaction in securities act hereinafter referred to as the act. a suit had been filed by the standard chartered bank sc against canbank mutual fund cmf for refund of a sum of rs.crores claiming the same to be due under sgl transfer forms in government of india security transactions purported to have been undertaken between scb and cmf in august / september. in the course of the written statement cmf took the stand that the transactions were squared off on the basis of documents made available to the appellant before affirming the written statement and tendering evidence. the special court held that taking up a false defence as pleaded in the written statement and repeating the same in the evidence in chief amounts to contempt of court and convicted the appellant to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of weeks and pay fine of rs. the learned judge in the course of the order held that perjury is contempt and there is a growing tendency amongst parties not to honour their commitments and pay up their dues and liabilities and file any sort of defence irrespective of whether it is true or not that therefore it is for courts to actively curb such tendencies. the special court prima facie felt that the defendant and depnt of written statement were aware that the defence was false at the time when written statements were filed and knowing it to be false took the same and sought to persist with it at the trial. show cause notices were issued -under sections and of the indian penal code and another for contempt of court -however no action was taken pursuant to the notice issued for offences under the indian penal code and these proceedings stood dropped. at the very outset on behalf of the appellant an unconditional apology was tendered. it was stated that in spite of fact that the appellant had a good answer to the show cause notice the apology was being tendered. however the special court rejected the apology tendered by the appellant by observing that there is an increasing tendency to commit the perjury or contempt and when caught out tender an unconditional apology and such an apology is not an expression of genuine remorse. in the course of the order the learned judge noticed as $$$ evidence in chief an explanation was sought to be given as to why such averments were made in the written statements. of course as the explanations themselves showed that the averments in the written statements were based on hearsay evidence the court did not allow the explanations to come on record. the fact remains that in evidence in chief the false statements were sought to be supported. $$$ in cross -examination an attempt was made to justify the false averments. only when it was found that the falsehood could not be maintained that the truth was admitted. though several contentions had been raised before the special court it is unnecessary to advert to the same. all that we need to examine in this case is whether the defence taken by the appellant would amount to contempt of court. in this case the false statement alleged is as under -"(e on th may the $$$ defendant in the course of their investment business had purchased certain securities being.% goi securities or the aggregate race value of rs.crores from the bank of karad ltd. hiten $$$ had acted as a broker in this transaction. the said bank of karad ltd.in order to effect transfer of the said securities to the defendant issued its combined sgl transfer form

in respect of the said sgl transfer forms issued by the bank of karad ltd. and which had been returned to hiten $$$ in july for rectification and replacement. on enquiry hiten $$$ informed the $$$ defendant that since there were sale transactions outstanding for the same security between the plaintiffs and the $$$ defendant in the sum of rs. crores and rs crores the $$$ defendant transactions with the plaintiffs to the extent of rs.crores would be squared off and delivery of all the security would be directly transacted and adjusted between the bank of karad ltd and the plaintiffs. he advised the $$$ defendant he would directly deliver to the plaintiffs fresh sgl forms for that amount issued by the bank of karad ltd. to the plaintiffs and would return to the $$$ defendant transfer

plaintiffs. on the $$$ defendant transactions with the banks having been squared off the $$$ defendant obligations under the said sgl transfer forms dated.for rs. crores dated .for rs. crores and dated.for rs.crores were discharged and there was no liability on part of the $$$ defendant. the appellant took the stand that he was working as divisional manager in charge of systems in the employment of canbank mutual fund that at the relevant time he was not concerned with transactions of investment that in june canbank investment services limited was incorporated to manage the affairs of the canbank mutual fund and that his services were therefore transferred to this company initially as a divisional manager and from december as an assistant general manager that on receipt of the standard chartered bank 's letter dated 1th may there appears to have been an internal inquiry by general manager and the chief executive fund and enquiries were also made by mr. $$$ who was assistant general manager at that time and he submitted a note on 7th may. further stand of the appellant was that he had been instructed to affirm the written statement on behalf of the trustees and he had no personal knowledge of the transactions and based on the records he verified the statement. the relevant records which the appellant read in order to verify the written statement were mr. $$$ 's letter dated $$$$ plaint in suit no. of $$$ 's committee report;(d charge -sheet filed by cbi in case no. rc43(a)//acb / bom;(e a statement recorded by cbi from mr. $$$ affidavits of mr. hiten dalal7. on the basis that the note of mr. narichania clearly indicated that the defence of squaring off was not correct the special court concluded that thus except for canbank 's own documents there is not a single document which shows or supports case of squaring off. on the contrary all documents of independent parties show that there is no squaring off as pleaded. the special court after adverting to various portions of the evidence further held that the appellant had committed contempt of court. however when the appellant tried to explain his position in regard to these matters to which we have adverted to earlier the same were not allowed to be brought on record on the basis that they are outcome of hearsay. the learned additional solicitor general who appears for the appellant contended that the learned judge of the special court had g far beyond the scope of the contempt jurisdiction particularly when the court held that on the basis of the documents produced by the cmf the stand of the bank had been throughout what had been stated in the written statement though with reference to other material that stand may be falsified. he contended that in a case of this nature what is important is that the party verifying the statement or tendering evidence before court should be doing so deliberately and to his knowledge the statement must be false. he drew our attention to the fact that the learned judge had noticed that the stand of the appellant was in conformity with plaint filed in the connected suit by cmf and that suit was yet to be tried at that stage when the order under appeal was passed. subsequently another learned judge who tried the suit of cmf held that the claim in that suit which is akin to the defence as raised in the present case is true and correct even after making a reference to the decision in the case out of which the contempt proceeding arises. therefore in the circumstances of the case he submitted that when views are possible on the basis of pleadings raised in a case the same would not amount to contempt of court at all. the written statement had been verified by the appellant that what is contained in written statement is based on the information received from the records of the defendants nos. to and he believed the same to be true. the verification of facts adverted to in the written statement is not made on the basis of personal knowledge of the appellant and the defence set up by him is on the basis of the stand taken by cmf in the companion suit. when in a suit of the cmf the stand had been accepted but in the suit against cmf such stand had been dis -believed it becomes difficult to say that the appellant had deliberately stated falsehood to mislead the court or to simply gain time to the disadvantage of the other party in this matter. where a verification is specific and deliberately false there is nothing in law to prevent a person from being proceeded for contempt. but it must be remembered that the very essence of crimes of this kind is not how such statements may injure this or that party to litigation but how they may deceive and mislead the courts and thus produce mischievous consequences to the administration of civil and criminal justice. a person is under a legal obligation to verify the allegations of fact made in the pleadings and if he verifies falsely he comes under the clutches of law. in order to expose a person to the liability of a prosecution of making false statement there must be a false statement of fact and not a mere parading made on the basis of facts which are themselves not false. merely because an action or defence can be an abuse of process of the court those responsible for its formulation can not be regarded as committing contempt but an attempt to deceive the court by disguising the nature of a claim is contempt. if the facts leading to a claim or defence are set out but an inference is drawn thereby stating that the stand of the plaintiff or defendant is way or the other it will not amount to contempt unless it be that the facts as pleaded themselves are false. further when the appellant tried to explain his case in his evidence the same was shut out on the basis that it is hearsay. an officer of bank who had no personal knowledge of the transactions in question and was deposing on the basis of material on record his evidence can not be from his knowledge and necessarily has to be hearsay. hence the learned judge was not justified in shutting out that part of the evidence. we therefore set aside the order made by the learned judge of the special court initiating the proceedings for contempt and convicting the appellant for the same. the entire proceedings in relation to contempt of court shall stand set aside. the appeal is allowed accordingly.
