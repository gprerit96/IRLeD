u.u. $$$ j. leave granted. this appeal challenges correctness of the judgment and order dated.passed by the high court of chhattisgarh at bilaspur allowing appeal no. of and setting aside concurrent decisions of the trial court and lower appellate court granting decree of eviction in favour of the $$$s. civil suit no. of was filed by vasudev shyamji and $$$ the predecessors of the $$$s seeking eviction of $$$ predecessor of the respondents from suit house which was described in the plaint as the front portion of house no. ward no. raigarh. the eviction was sought on grounds including bona fide need. in paragraph of his written statement $$$ stated....it is specifically denied that the $$$ are owners of house no. in ward no. of raigarh town. this being a suit for eviction of a tenant the question of ownership is not relevant to the suit. thus though it was denied that the $$$ were owners of the suit house in the very next sentence defendant $$$ asserted that the question of ownership was not relevant in the instant suit. $$$ entered the witness box and in his cross -examination admitted that the lease from nazul department stood in the name of $$$ and that the witness himself had produced the same in some other proceedings. it was further accepted that he had paid rent by my orders sent in the name of $$$ father of the $$$. the aforesaid suit was re -numbered as civil suit no. of. after considering the evidence on record the trial court by its judgment and order dated.decreed the suit principally on the ground that the $$$ required the suit house for reconstruction and for bona fide need. the matter having been carried in appeal by bhanaram the lower appellate court also considered the question regarding ownership of the suit house. while considering the evidence of bhanaram it observed...this witness has also admitted that lease from nazul of this property was also accepted in the name of $$$ and he himself has produced that lease on his behalf in other civil court.the lower appellate court affirmed the view taken by the trial court and dismissed civil appeal no. vide its judgment and order dated.. the heirs of bhanaram namely the respondents being aggrieved filed appeal no. of in the high court of chhattisgarh at bilaspur. this appeal came to be allowed by the high court vide judgment and order dated.. it was observed by the high court that for a plaintiff to succeed in seeking eviction of tenant on the ground of bona fide need under section of the chhatisgarh accommodation control act hereinafter referred to as the act it was incumbent to establish that he was owner of the accommodation in question. after considering the evidence on record particularly that of $$$ it was observed evidence of this witness pleadings and evidence of $$$ sharma clearly reveal that father of vasudev shyamji i. $$$ was landlord of the suit accommodation but was not owner of the suit accommodation. in his detailed evidence vasudev shyamji has not stated anything to show that how he became owner of the suit accommodation.according to the high court the fact that $$$ used to pay rent of the suit house to the father of the $$$ was not sufficient to prove ownership over the suit house especially when ownership was under dispute and the $$$ had not adduced any evidence to prove the issue of ownership. the aforesaid judgment of the high court is presently under appeal. we heard mr. kamal mohan $$$ learned advocate in support of the quotation and mr. ujjal banerjee learned advocate for the respondents. relying on the decision of this court in anar devi smt.v. $$$ / sc/07/$$$$$$$ / sc/07/$$$$ scc it was submitted by mr. $$$ learned advocate that the defendant was estopped from questioning the title of the $$$ and that the high court was in error in allowing the appeal. mr. banerjee learned advocate supported the view taken by the high court and submitted that no evidence whatsoever was led to prove ownership of the suit house which was necessary in view of section of the act. the relevant provision namely section of the act is as under:. restriction on eviction of tenants-(1 notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract no suit shall be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on or more of the following grounds only namely........................that the accommodation let for residential purpose is required bona fide by the landlord for occupation as a residence for himself or for any member of his family if he is the owner thereof or for any person for whose benefit the accommodation is held and that the landlord or such person has no other reasonably suitable residential accommodation of his own in his occupation in the city or town concerned........................... in anar devi 's case the provision which came up for consideration was section of m.p. accommodation control act which was as under:23-a. special provisions for eviction of tenant on ground of bona fide requirement.--notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or contract to the contrary a landlord may submit an application signed and verified in a manner provided in rules and of order vi of the first schedule to the code of civil procedure v of as if it were a plaint to the rent controlling authority on or more of the following grounds for an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the accommodation namely--(a......explanation..that the accommodation let for non -residential purpose of continuing or starting his business or that of any of his major sons or unmarried daughters if he is the owner thereof or for any person for whose benefit the accommodation is held and that the landlord or such person has no other reasonably suitable non -residential accommodation of his own in his occupation in the city or town concerned....................... the relevant provision in the instant case namely section of the act is pari materia with section which was considered in anar devi 's case. the expression if he is the owner thereof is common and identically placed. para of the decision in anar devi 's case discloses that the respondent -tenant had acknowledged the ownership of the accommodation as that of the $$$ and had regarded her as the landlord in his counter notice. in the circumstances it was held that the respondent was not entitled to deny the title of the $$$ to the accommodation. during the course of its judgment this court dealt with tenant 's estoppel as statutorily recognized in section of the evidence act and observed as under:10. since the doctrine of tenant 's estoppel could throw light on the question as to what can make a landlord to succeed in enforcing his right to recover possession of accommodation from a tenant under clause of section of the act it would be advantageous to refer to its scope and applicability before taking it up for our consideration. doctrine of tenant 's estoppel which governs the relationship of landlord and tenant is founded on a contract of tenancy entered into by them is well settled. jessel m.r.who adverted to that doctrine in stringer 's estate shaw v. jones -ford lr ch d lt explains it thus where a man having no title obtains possession of land under a demise by a man in possession who assumes to give him a title as tenant he can not deny his landlord 's title as for instance if he takes for -years and he finds that the landlord has only years ' title he can not after years set up against the landlord the jus tertii though of course the real owner can always recover against him. that is a perfectly intelligible doctrine. he took possession under a contract to pay rent so long as he held possession under the landlord and to give it up at the end of the term to the landlord and having taken it in that way he is not allowed to say that the man whose title he admits and under whose title he took possession has not a title. that is a well -established doctrine. that is estoppel by contract. indeed the said doctrine of tenant 's estoppel finds statutory recognition in section of the indian evidence act for short the evidence act in that it states that no tenant of immovable property or person claiming through such tenant shall during the continuance of the tenancy be permitted to deny that the landlord of such tenant had at the beginning of the tenancy a title to such immovable property. this court in sri ram pasricha v. $$$ / sc/0473/$$$$$$$ / sc/0473/$$$$ scc has also ruled that in a suit for eviction by landlord the tenant is estopped from questioning the title of the landlord because of section of the act. the judicial committee in kumar krishna prasad $$$ v. baraboni coal concern ltd. $$$ / pr/0072/1937$$$ / pr/0072/1937 air pc when had occasion to examine the contention based on the words at the beginning of the tenancy in section of the evidence act pronounced that they do not give a ground for a person already in possession of land becoming tenant of another to contend that there is no estoppel against his denying his subsequent lessor 's title. ever since the accepted position is that section of the evidence act applies and estops even a person already in possession as tenant under landlord from denying the title of his subsequent landlord when once he acknowledges him as his landlord by attornment or conduct. therefore a tenant of immovable property under landlord who becomes a tenant under another landlord by accepting him to be the owner who had derived title from the former landlord can not be permitted to deny the latter 's title even when he is sought to be evicted by the latter on a permitted ground. the scope and applicability of the doctrine of tenant 's estoppel being what we have said of it we shall now proceed to consider the aforesaid question which has arisen with reference to the right of landlord under section 23a(b of the act in the matter of recovery of possession of the accommodation from the tenant. in the instant case though $$$ in his written statement had denied ownership of the plaintiffs he went on to add this being a suit for eviction of a tenant the question of ownership is not relevant to the suit. in his cross -examination he clearly admitted that the lease from nazul department stood in the name of the plaintiffs and that the witness himself had produced that document in some other proceedings. he had further admitted that he used to pay rent by money orders in the name of the father of the plaintiffs. on facts it must be held that $$$ had without any doubt regarded the plaintiffs as landlords and owners of the suit house. this matter is thus fully covered by the decision of this court in anar devi 's case and it was not open to $$$ to question the ownership of the plaintiffs -landlords. in the circumstances the view taken by the high court while setting aside the concurrent decisions of the courts below was not correct and justified. we therefore allow this appeal. while setting aside the judgment under appeal we restore the decisions of the trial court and the lower appellate court passed in the instant case. since respondents are in occupation of the suit house for last more than years we deem it appropriate to grant them time upto 31st august to vacate and hand -over peaceful possession of the suit house to the appellants subject to the respondents filing usual undertakings within weeks from the date of this judgment. in case no such undertakings are filed by each of the respondents within the time so stipulated the appellants shall be free to execute the decree for eviction of the suit house. the appeal stands allowed in the aforesaid terms without any order as to costs.
