$$$ j. leave granted. the impugned judgment on limitation to file a suit gives an interesting reading on reasoning learned trial court has vide impugned order disposed the application filed under order rule by the defendant on the ground that.was non -working $$$$ therefore the suit was filed on.is within limitation. although there is no bar for fling of suit on non -working $$$$ but if the suit is not filed on non -working $$$$ under the assumption that it is non -working $$$$ then the mistake of non -fling is a bonafide mistake so the mistake is taken as bonafide mistake. it is not in dispute that the last date for fling the suit was.$$$$ of winter vacation for court..was a $$$$ and even according to the high court it is non -working $$$$ for the judges for enabling them to write judgments and regular hearing of cases is not heard on a non -working $$$$. obviously it was not a holiday for the registry and there is no question of any confusion though such confusion also can not save limitation to file a suit. section of the limitation act referred to as the act dealing with expiry of prescribed period when court is closed no doubt applies to suits as well and in case the prescribed period for any suit appeal or application expires on $$$$ when the court is closed the suit appeal or application may be instituted preferred or made on $$$$ when the court reopens. the explanation under section of the act also makes it clear that explanation.court shall be deemed to be closed on $$$$ within the meaning of this section if during any part of its normal working hours it remains closed on $$$$. there is no case for anybody that even for part of $$$$ the registry was closed. but section of the act which deals with extension of prescribed period in certain cases applies only to appeals or applications and not to suits. therefore no court or tribunal can extend the period of limitation for fling a suit. even if any cause beyond the control of the plaintiff is shown also the only extension is what is permitted under section of the act the period coming under court holiday. thus both the trial court and the high court have gravely gone wrong on the principles on the law of limitation. therefore the impugned order is set aside. the application filed by the appellant under order vii rule of the code of civil procedure is allowed. recovery suit no. on the file of the adj gwalior madhya pradesh is dismissed. the appeal is allowed as above. there shall be no order as to costs.
