any complaints / claims arising out of quality of cement damages shortages poor packing due to negligence on the part of cocem would be debited to cocem.xxxxx xxxxx. cocem shall not use acc 's $$$ / brand names in any form after the termination or expiry of this agreement. on the basis of the aforesaid agreement the $$$ -assessee put forth his stand before the assessing officer that his case was covered under section of the kerala general sales tax act for brevity the act and therefore the sale effected by the cochin cement limited should be treated as the sale. the assessing officer on the basis of intelligence report and other materials brought on record came to the conclusion that the cochin cement limited had been manufacturing the cement and handing over the same to the assessee. on a perusal of the impugned orders it is noticeable that the report of the concerned intelligent officer has met with approval up to the revisional stage. to have a complete picture we may usefully reproduce the finding recorded by the assessing officer in the order of assessment as per schedule to the agreement associated cement cos. is charging rs. per ton for marketing and service charges and only after deducting that amount associated cement company need pay the balance to cochin cement ltd.after adjusting the price of clinker. during the course of inspection on.effected in the premises of cochin cement ltd.at ernakulam a copy of the report regarding cement marketing prepared by sri s.r. iyer senior dy. general manager cochin cement ltd.was recovered by intelligence squad no. ernakulam which reveals that cement manufactured by cochin cement ltd. is fully marketed by associated cement company in its brand name. it is also stated that the responsibility of clinker supply and also the marketing and selling the cement produced by cochin cement ltd.lies with associated cement company from the above it is evident that cochin cement ltd. is only a manufacturer of cement and that too by using the raw material supplied by the assessee with specified quality of acc standard and entire cement manufactured are to be delivered at different depots of the assessee. only assessee is marketing the cement and cochin cement ltd. is not entitled to sell out even a single bag of cement in the market over and above the programme given by the assessee. entire goods manufactured are delivered at assessee 's depots and is being marketed by assessee in its brand name. and all the sales effected through depots of the assessee have al being assessed under section of kgst act newly amended. only those cement which has been manufactured by cochin cement ltd. and sold by assessee in its brand name revealed and accounted in the assessee 's books of accounts has been brought to tax by this order. in other words if cochin cement ltd. is selling goods to others by itself the question of coming those transaction into the books of accounts of the assessee does not arise at all. in the circumstances the contention of the assessee that cochin cement ltd. is marketing cement to the customers by itself falls to the ground.the said authority has further opined the question of brand name in this case arose in respect of goods manufactured by cochin cement ltd.and sold by the assessee. it is only for the sake of marketing that brand name is used by the assessee in respect of cement manufactured by the cochin cement ltd. a stranger company other than assessee the brand name is the brand name allotted to associated cement company under the trade and mercantile act and those goods manufactured by a company other than associated cement company if sold by acc under its brand name it will very well come under the purview of newly introduced section. therefore the contention that cochin cement ltd.is brand name holder is a very feable augment. sub -section of section reads.notwithstanding anything contained in this act in respect of goods other than tea sold in auction in the state which are sold under a trade mark or brand name the sale by the brand name holder or the trade mark holder within the state shall be the sale for the purpose of this act. the impugned transaction is a typical coming under the above provision. the cement sold by the assessee is which is manufactured by cochin cement ltd. and from cochin cement ltd. assessee purchased and cement so purchased sold under its brand name acc and claimed exemption as sale. but by virtue of above said provision the assessee 's $$$$ sale is treated as sale. be it noted the order of assessment has received the stamp of approval by the higher authorities as well as by the high court. in this backdrop we may proceed to analyse the statutory scheme. section of the act which is the charging section reads as follows every dealer other than a casual trade or agent of an non -resident dealer whose total turnover for $$$$ is not less than lakh rupees and every casual trader or agent of a non -resident dealer whatever be his total turnover for $$$$ shall pay tax on his taxable turnover of $$$$. mr. s. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the $$$ has laid immense emphasis on section which reads thus notwithstanding anything contained in this act in respect of manufactured goods other than tea which are sold under the trade mark or brand name the sale by the brand name holder or the trade mark holder within the state shall be the sale for the purposes of this act. the learned senior counsel would contend that the cochin cement limited is the brand name holder of the present $$$ and therefore the sale at its hand has to be treated as sale for the purposes of this act. in this regard we think it appropriate to refer to section and of the act which read thus:5(a where a dealer liable to tax under sub -section sells any goods to a trade mark or brand name holder for sale a trade mark or brand name no such dealer shall be liable to pay tax under the said sub -section if he produces before the assessing authority a declaration in the prescribed form from that trade mark or brand name holder. where a trade mark or brand name holder consumes the goods purchased by under -section in the manufacture of other goods or uses or disposes of such goods in any manner otherwise than by way of sale within the state or despatches such goods to any place outside the state otherwise than by way of inter -state sale such trade mark or brand name holder shall be liable to pay tax on the turnover relating to such purchase for $$$$ irrespective of the quantum of his total turnover. on a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions it is discernible that the legislature has clearly expressed its intention to treat the sale by the brand name holder or the trade mark holder as the sale. in the case of cryptom confectioneries pvt. ltd. v. state of kerala $$$ / sc/0501/$$$$$$$ / sc/0501/$$$$ vst sc section came up for consideration and a -judge bench analysing the anatomy of the provision has laid down thus the aforesaid sub -section commences with a non obstante clause i.irrespective of section of the act or any other provision under the act. the said sub -section speaks of a sale made by a brand name holder of the trade mark holder within the state. the legislature deems that such a sale by the brand name holder or the trade mark holder shall be the sale within the state. in our opinion this is the only possible construction that can be given to sub -section of section of the act. keeping in view the aforesaid provision let us once again trace the transaction between the $$$ and the licensee namely m / s. bristo foods pvt. ltd. on a scrutiny of the facts of the said case it is manifest that the issue that squarely fell for consideration is whether the sale at the hands of the appellant therein would be treated as the first sale. dealing with the stand of the appellant this court stated according to the appellant / assessee who is a branded name holder m / s. bristo foods pvt. ltd.has licence and is permitted to use the branded name crytm. the licensee manufactures the goods namely confectioneries and effect supply of sale to the brand name holder. it is the brand name holder who effects the sale of the confectioneries which are to be taxed as item of the first schedule to the act within the state. therefore it is the brand name holder who has to be pay tax under section of the act. if for any reason m / s. bristo foods pvt. ltd. has paid the tax while effecting the supply of the manufactured commodity to the appellant / assessee the appellant / assessee and m / s. bristo foods pvt. ltd. can approach the authorities for claiming the refund of the tax paid by them. on a careful appreciation of the aforesaid decision we find the factual matrix therein is explicitly the same as is in the present case. however mr. s. $$$ learned senior counsel would submit that in the said case there has been no consideration of the concepts like brand name holder and trade mark holder and therefore the said decision should not be treated as a precedent. on the basis of the aforesaid submission mr. $$$ contends that the said decision requires reconsideration and this court should refer it to a larger bench. mr. $$$ further submits that the ratio of the decision has to be understood in the background of the facts of the case and a decision is an authority for what is actually decides not what logically follows from it. according to him as the relevant provisions have not been construed it can not be regarded as a binding precedent. needless to say the proposition canvassed by mr. $$$ neither invites a dispute nor calls for a debate. it is so the said proposition has been stated in quinn v. leathem ac which has been followed in ambica quarry works v. state of gujarat and ors. $$$ / sc/0853/1988$$$ / sc/0853/1988 air sc. but such is not the case here. first of all in the earlier decision section was considered and a view has been expressed and therefore it can not be said that a provision has not been referred to or not considered. hence it is a binding precedent. the issue which has been ambitiously projected by mr. $$$ is that the decision even if a binding precedent requires reconsideration as the relevant terms employed in section have not been appositely considered. what is limpid is that section is an expression of the legislative intention that the sales at the hands of the brand name holder and trade mark holder would be treated as the first sale. on a perusal of the agreement entered into between the parties it is not remotely suggestive of the fact that cochin cement limited is a brand name holder or trade mark holder. hence the ambitious submission of mr. $$$ has to melt as a glacier and we say so. $$$ the decision in cryptom confectioneries pvt. ltd. does not require reconsideration. in view of the aforesaid analysis the appeals being devoid of merit are dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs.
