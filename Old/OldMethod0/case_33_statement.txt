u.u. $$$ j. this petition under article of the constitution of india has been filed in public interest by an advocate practising in this court highlighting an incident that occurred on.near moha$$$adabad crossing in shahjahanpur division in state of uttar pradesh. the petitir has prayed for directions inter alia for finding out reasons for loss of lives for assessment of damage to property and for grant of compensation or financial assistance to victims. he has also prayed for directions for laying down guidelines for necessary precautions and care to be taken so that such tragedy is not repeated again. the incident highlighted in the petition was. in a recruitment drive aimed at filling up posts of class iv employees $$$an border police itbp for short had called candidates from states at its headquarter located at bareilly a small town in uttar pradesh on.. the aspiring candidates for said posts were required to remain present in person and submit their forms for registration. in response to said recruitment drive aspirants started arriving at bareilly and by of.more than lakh aspirants had arrived. the gathering was swelling and increasing in number. the officers of itbp found themselves incapable of managing the situation because of such large gathering and as such they suspended and postpd the drive. the consequent resentment and shouting of slogans in protest by aspirants provoked the higher officers of itbp to use lathi charge to push the crowd. this resulted in a chaotic situation with some aspirants resorting to violence. the armed police then had to use tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. massive disturbance and lawlessness prevailed all over the town causing law and order problem. some buses were burnt and damage was caused to public and private property. in the backdrop of such situation the crowd of aspiring candidates rushed to rail and road terminals to return back to their homes. because of congestion and crowd in large members the train coaches were all jam packed.  of young men then climbed atop himgiri express that was on its way to eastern u.p. and bihar from where large number of aspirants had come.d. when himgiri express left shahjahanpur railway station with of men on roof top and headed towards $$$ town an accident took place at hathaurda railway over bridge near moha$$$adabad crossing in shahjahanpur. the railway over bridge was not tall enough and the gap between the roof of the coach and the bottom of the over bridge was hardly feet. the train was speeding fast and by the time the young men on roof top saw the approaching bridge it was too late.  young men were crushed there and then with others seriously injured having been hit by the over bridge and fallen from roof top. at this time some high tension wire broke and fell over the train as a result of which some received electric shocks. despite this mishap the train continued running for a while and it finally stopped some kms from the place of incident. the roof top of coaches was full of blood. the dead bodies and injured were brought down. people rushed back to find out those who had fallen from the roof top. the train driver guard and other employees had run away from the spot.f. the incident provoked those young aspirants some of whom torched coaches of the train. what followed thereafter was total chaos putting tremendous pressure on the administration in carrying out relief work and taking injured to hospitals for medical attention. with the aforesaid assertions this petition was filed on.. in the meantime railway administration had ordered an enquiry. by interim order passed by this court the respondents were directed to submit the report pursuant to enquiry instituted by them. consequently enquiry report dated.by mr. raj kumar kardam co$$$issir of railway safety northern circle new delhi was placed on record. the record indicates that this report was preceded by preliminary report dated.. the relevant portions of chapter of the report dated.under heading discussion are as under time of the accident...as per the statement of loco pilot assistant loco pilot and guard of train no. dn ja$$$u $$$ -$$$ the train passed shahjahanpur station at hrs. the other records also show that this train passed shahjahanpur station at hrs a few passengers travelling on the roofs of the coaches

over the bridge located at lko east end in shahjahanpur yard was assessed as kmph. a few passengers travelling on the roofs of the coaches of this train got struck against the public foot over bridge located at lko east end in shahjahanpur yard near the end of the platform.from the above the speed of the train no. dn at the time of accident is thus considered as kmph.cause of the accident from the particulars of injuries suffered by the roof travelers it was observed that most of the persons injured had been hit in the upper portion of their heads. it was also evident that injuries were caused to passengers who were traveling and sitting / standing on the roof of the coaches. an incident of hitting of an obstruction resulting in such type of injuries to the roof riders could be caused in all probabilities by striking against the existing foot over bridge road over bridge etc.......................evidence available reveals that before starting the trains all possible efforts were made by the railway and civil officials to get the roof riders come down from roof. continuous announcements were made through public address system and loud hailers. adrm $$$. dsc / rpf sp / railway and civil authorities were continuously monitoring the situation. however the roof riders refused to come down from the roof top of the coaches. they were also throwing sts on passengers and officials. large number of jyreens had also gathered at railway station and approached adrm for help and protection. in this situation possibilities of taking incidence a turn to co$$$unal violence were very much there as this area is a co$$$unal sensitive area and has passed through co$$$unal violence very recently march and august. in view of above the situation had become highly volatile and had the decision to move the train was not taken at that time by the railway the violent crowd would have damaged the station property and trains on the platforms and could have resulted in stampede and unmanageable situation at the railway station. dm / be ig / be dig / be sp / be and other civil and police officials were themselves available at bareilly station to watch and control the situation. they also insisted for the movement of the trains as quickly as possible and in whatever manner. the idea was to disperse the crowd as early as possible. the situation was even being watched at rampur

administration for removal / regularization of the infringements..on scrutiny of the steel structure register of iow / spn and bridge inspection register for rob / fobs of aden / spn it was seen that though the inspections were being carried out regularly but the vertical clearances from the rail level to this fixed structures like fob robs were not being measured during the inspections as this have not been prescribed in the proforma available for recording the various parameters. clearance is an important item as these may get changed due to track renewals change in ballast cushion or any other reason resulting into the rail level being raised and may infringe the schedule of dimensions. therefore it is very much essential that proper record and upkeep of such an important item is kept.railway administration should issue a standard proforma for steel structure register and bridge inspection register to be maintained for the inspection of rob / fobs which should also include the item of measurements to be taken for clearances.role of railway officials and others no railway officials were found to be responsible for the accident as such this aspect is not discussed in the report. the primary responsibility rests with those persons who travelled on the roofs of coaches in violation of section of the indian railways act. in chapter titled conclusions it was stated in the

baliya. the affidavit further stated that no -gratia payment was made to any injured or relative of any person who died in the incident. as regards direction no. regarding lucknow division it was stated steps taken by railways to remove infringement of foot over bridge in lucknow division. in this respect it is submitted that the action plan for the removal of infringement of fobs in lucknow division submitted by $$$. dev / c northern railways lucknow vide letter no. drm / lko / engg / fob/ dated.is annexed with this affidavit.a tabular chart giving details regarding required clearances and actual available clearances as well as the nature and extent of infringement in respect of cases from lucknow division was also appended to the affidavit. with respect to direction no. what has been placed on record are communications dated.and.which were issued after the preliminary report dated.and the aforesaid report dated.respectively. these communications quoted relevant paragraphs of the respective reports and stated that a special drive be undertaken. we also have on record a letter dated.from railway board addressed to chief claim officer headquarter office new delhi saying that a special drive was launched vide letter dated.. what happened as a result of such special drive has however not been placed on record. nothing has been placed on record if similar infringements are found present in divisions other than lucknow division and if so what safety measures are undertaken or are to be undertaken and what is the road map for removing such infringements. it appears that despite paragraph.of the report dated.no assessment of any kind has been undertaken in divisions other than lucknow division and consequently nothing has been placed on record. an affidavit has also been filed by $$$ senior administrative officer directorate general $$$ border police force ministry of home affairs government of india dealing with direction nos. and. in response to direction no. the affidavit states as under reply to direction no. -it is respectfully submitted that after this incident the respondent / itbp has not conducted open rally based recruitments. the candidates are now being called for physical efficiency test and physical standard test by post only under the supervision of a nodal officer in a limited and controlled manner. state administrative authorities at district and higher levels are being informed well in advance regarding the time venue date and timing of recruitments and are requested to ensure adequate arrangements to maintain law and order outside the itbp recruitment venues. the presiding officers of recruitment boards and nodal officer have been directed to maintain close liaison with district administration. a provision has been made in the standard operating procedure of the recruitment that not more than candidates will be called at recruitment center at a time for recruitment test of physical efficiency test and physical standard test etc. in the case of $$$ tradesmen recruitment candidates are being called in days cycle at each centre. as regards direction no. the affidavit goes on to state that standing order no. of dated.and standing order no. of dated.were issued ensuring that only candidates would hereafter be called in cycle on $$$$. to similar effect is the standing order dated.. however these standing orders pertain to itbp al and it is not clear whether similar standing orders are issued and are in operation as regards other central police organisations. the report dated.indicates that requests were made by the railway and civil officials to get the roof riders come down from the roof and announcements were made in that behalf. though the roof riders refused to come down in view of the volatile situation a decision was taken to move the train out of bareilly. according to the report the civil and police officials insisted for the movement of the train as quickly as possible with an idea to disperse the crowd. may accept this as a reasonable and proper exercise as the crowd had to be dispersed which had congregated in bareilly. however this does not explain and justify further movement of the train for more than kms from bareilly station. what is more worrisome is that the fact that train was running at a speed of kilometers per hour. those who were in charge of railway administration in the concerned divisions ought to have taken sufficient precaution. the administration can certainly be taken to be aware of the fact that the foot -over $$$ or any structures on the way could possibly be a hindrance and could have caused such incident with people in large number on roof top. the administration al would be in a position to know about the existence of infringements with regard to certain structures and what could be possible implications if the train were to run at a great speed with large number of people on roof top. reasonable care would naturally be expected of those incharge of the administration. we therefore do not agree with the conclusion in the report that railway administration was not responsible. in chairman railway board v. $$$ $$$ / sc/0046/$$$$$$$ / sc/0046/$$$$ scc while considering the liability of railways when some of the employees had taken a lady from bangladesh to rail yatri niwas and subjected her to rape it was observed by this court,4. running of the railways is a commercial activity. establishing the yatri niwas at various railway stations to provide lodging and boarding facilities to passengers on payment of charges is a part of the commercial activity of the union of india and this activity can not be equated with the exercise of sovereign power. the employees of the union of india who are deputed to run the railways and to manage the establishment including the railway stations and the yatri niwas are essential compnts of the government machinery which carries on the commercial activity. if any of such employees commits an act of tort the union government of which they are the employees can subject to other legal requirements being satisfied be held vicariously liable in damages to the person wronged by those employees. in m.s. grewal v. deep chand sood manu / sc/006/$$$$manu / sc/006/$$$$ scc this court considered the concept duty of care in a fact situation where teachers who had accompanied school children for a picnic on the bank of a river when the mishap happened and stated as under:. duty of care varies from situation to situation whereas it would be the duty of the teacher to supervise the children in the playground but the supervision as the children leave the school may not be required in the same degree as is in the playfield. while it is true that if the students are taken to another school building for participation in certain games it is sufficient exercise of diligence to know that the premises are otherwise safe and secure but undoubtedly if the students are taken out to a playground near a river for fun and a swim the degree of care required stands at a much higher degree and no deviation therefrom can be had on any count whatsoever. mere satisfaction that the river is otherwise safe for a swim by reason of popular sayings will not be a sufficient compliance. as a matter of fact the degree of care required to be taken especially against the minor children stands at a much higher level than adults children need much stricter care............. turning attention however on to the issue of vicarious liability redeeming feature that ought to be noticed at this juncture is that to escort the children was the duty assigned to the teachers and till such time thus the period of escorting stands over can not but ascribe it to be in the course of employment the teachers were assigned to escort the students the reason obviously being the children should otherwise be safe and secure and it is the act of utter negligence of the teachers which has resulted in this unfortunate tragedy and thus it is no gainsaying that the teachers were on their own frolic and the school had d all that was possible to be d in the matter safety of the children obviously was of prime concern so far as the school authorities are concerned and till such time the children returned to school safe and secure after the picnic the course of employment in our view continued and thus resultantly the liability of the school. in $$$ supra compensation of rs. lakhs as awarded by the high court was upheld while in m.s. grewal supra this court sustained the order awarding compensation of rs. lakhs in case of death. in the backdrop of the aforesaid precedents in our view it must be expected of the persons concerned to be aware of the inherent danger in allowing the train to run with such speed having large number of persons travelling on roof top. though the people who travelled on roof top also contributed to the mishap the railway administration in our view was not free from blame. concluding so we direct that the next of kin of those who died in the incident and those who sustained injuries must be duly compensated by the railway administration. those who died were obviously very young in age for they had come to compete for the jobs. taking all these factors in consideration we direct railway administration to pay:(a compensation of rs. lakhs to the next of kin in case of every death;(b compensation of rs.lakhs in every case of permanent disability suffered by any in the incident;(c compensation of rs. in case of any grievous injury suffered by any compensation of rs. in case of simple injury suffered by any. it is distressing that despite paragraph no.of the report the railway administration has not considered collecting data in divisions other than lucknow division whether there are any infringements as per schedule of dimensions stated in said paragraph. the administration must take every care so that such tragedy is not repeated. the step in that behalf is to have an assessment if any such infringements exist and then to create a road -map to remove such infringements. we therefore direct the railway administration to implement directions stated in paragraph no.of the report dated.. the committee headed by a senior officer and assisted by at least persons from the administration having technical knowledge and expertise be constituted to have an assessment of all such infringements and to chalk out an action plan to remove such infringements. it is possible that in some cases road over bridges may have been built by state governments $$$ or such bodies. ntheless the action plan must contemplate ways and means to deal with and remove such infringements. we direct that the committee as aforesaid be constituted within a period of weeks from the date of this order. we hope and trust that the committee shall take appropriate steps in collecting data as stated above and creating road map or action plan to remove such infringements in the shortest possible time. as regards the infringements pointed in lucknow division the aforesaid committee shall take immediate steps. if the clearances are specified and stipulated in schedule of dimensions rules the committee may do well to ensure strict compliance. every dispensation sought may be considered threadbare and be granted only as a last resort. we direct the committee to complete the work as early as possible so that all infringements could be removed in shortest possible time and in any case not later than years. we direct the committee to file periodic status reports every months in this court. we also direct that copies of this order be sent by the registry to the minister railways and secretary railways who are requested to ensure compliance of the directions as aforesaid. further all central police organisations must issue guidelines or standing order akin to standing orders nos. of and of of itbp ensuring that only candidates or such number of candidates as could easily be managed or taken care of be called in cycle on $$$$. for compliance in that behalf a copy of this order be sent by the registry to the secretary ministry of home affairs. with these directions the petition stands disposed of.
