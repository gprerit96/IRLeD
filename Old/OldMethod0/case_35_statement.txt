ayyappan chettiar had daughters namely $$$ $$$ and andal. $$$ and andal died intestate leaving legal heirs as such suit is bad for non -joinder of remaining daughter of ayyappan chettiar and legal

whether the signature of ayyappan chettiar my father in ex. a-4 is genuine by comparing the signature of ayyappan chettiar in ex. a-4 with his admitted signatures in ex. b- to b-3 by a competent hand -writing expert and further direct him to file a report to the scientific investigation d by him and justice thus rendered. the appellate court vide order dated.allowed the la. no. of and directed the $$$ to deposit a sum of rs. as fee. the defendant challenged the order passed by the appellate court allowing the application for additional evidence before the high court in civil revision petition pd $$$ no. of which is allowed by said court by the impugned order assailed before us. under the scheme of $$$ of civil procedure for short the $$$ whether oral or documentary it is the trial court before whom parties are required to adduce their evidence. but in exceptional circumstances additional evidence can be adduced before the appellate court as provided under section read with rule of $$$ of the $$$. rule of $$$ reads as under:. production of additional evidence in appellate court.the parties to an appeal shall not be entitled to produce additional evidence whether oral or documentary in the appellate court. but if-(a the court from whose decree the appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to have been admitted or(aa the party seeking to produce additional evidence establishes that notwithstanding the exercise of due diligence such evidence was not within his knowledge or could not after the exercise of due diligence be produced by him at the time when the decree appealed against was passed or(b the appellate court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce judgment or for any other substantial cause the appellate court may allow such evidence or document to be produced or witness to be examined.wherever additional evidence is allowed to be produced by an appellate court the court shall record the reason for its admission.emphasis supplied)2. from the opening words of sub -rule of rule quoted above it is clear that the parties are not entitled to produce additional evidence whether oral or documentary in the appellate court but for the situations mentid above. the parties are not allowed to fill the lacunae at the appellate stage. it is against the spirit of the $$$ to allow a party to adduce additional evidence without fulfillment of either of the conditions mentid in rule. in the case at hand no application was moved before the trial court seeking scientific examination of the document ex. a-4 nor can it be said that the plaintiff with due diligence could not have moved such an application to get proved the documents relied upon by him. now it is to be seen whether the condition i. contained in clause b of sub -rule of rule is fulfilled or not. in k.r. $$$ v. net work inc. $$$ / sc/9/$$$$$$$ / sc/9/$$$$ scc this court has held as $$$$. the appellate court should not pass an order so as to patch up the weakness of the evidence of the unsuccessful party before the trial court but it will be different if the court itself requires the evidence to do justice between the parties. the ability to pronounce judgment is to be understood as the ability to pronounce judgment satisfactorily to the mind of the court. but mere difficulty is not sufficient to issue such direction... in north eastern railway admn. v. $$$ $$$ / sc/4/$$$$$$$ / sc/4/$$$$ scc this court observed thus:3. though the general rule is that ordinarily the appellate court should not travel outside the record of the lower court and additional evidence whether oral or documentary is not admitted but section $$$ of civil procedure which carves out an exception to the general rule enables an appellate court to take additional evidence or to require such evidence to be taken subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed. these conditions are prescribed under order rule $$$ of civil procedure. nevertheless the additional evidence can be admitted only when the circumstances as stipulated in the said rule are found to exist... in. $$$ dead and $$$. v. ayyasamy and anr. $$$ / sc/0422/$$$$$$$ / sc/0422/$$$$ scc this court interpreting rule of $$$ of the $$$ has observed in para as under..the provisions of order rule have not been engrafted in the $$$ so as to patch up the weak points in the case and to fill up the omission in the court of appeal -it does not authorize any lacunae or gaps in the evidence to be filled up. the authority and jurisdiction as conferred on to the appellate court to let in fresh evidence is restricted to the purpose of pronouncement of judgment in a particular way. in union of india v. ibrahim uddin and anr. $$$ / sc/05/$$$$$$$ / sc/05/$$$$ scc this court has held as under:49. an application under order rule code of civil procedure is to be considered at the time of hearing of appeal on merits so as to find out whether the documents and/or the evidence sought to be adduced have any relevance / bearing on the issues involved. the admissibility of additional evidence does not depend upon the relevancy to the issue on hand or on the fact whether the applicant had an opportunity for adducing such evidence at an earlier stage or not but it depends upon whether or not the appellate court requires the evidence sought to be adduced to enable it to pronounce judgment or for any other substantial cause. the true test therefore is whether the appellate court is able to pronounce judgment on the materials before it without taking into consideration the additional evidence sought to be adduced... $$$ for the $$$ argued before us that the high court in revision at an interim stage of appeal pending before the lower appellate court should not have interfered in the matter of requirement of additional evidence. we have considered the argument advanced on behalf of the $$$ and also perused the law laid down by this court as to the exercise of revisional power under section of the code in such matters. in mahavir singh and ors. v. naresh chandra and anr. $$$ / sc/074/00$$$ / sc/074/00 scc explaining the scope of revision in the matters of acceptance of additional evidence by the lower appellate court interpreting expression or for any other substantial cause in rule of $$$ this court has held as under the words or for any other substantial cause must be read with the word requires which is set out at the commencement of the provision so that it is only where for any other substantial cause the appellate court requires additional evidence that this rule would apply as noticed by the privy council in $$$ v. g.i.p. rly. $$$ / mh/0072/07$$$ / mh/0072/07 ilr -bom. it is under these circumstances such a power could be exercised. therefore when the appellate court did not find the necessity to allow the application we fail to understand as to how the high court could in exercise of its power under section code of civil procedure have interfered with such an order particularly when the whole appeal is not before the court. it is only in the circumstances when the appellate court requires such evidence to pronounce the judgment the necessity to adduce additional evidence would arise and not in any other circumstances. when the appellate court passed the order on the application filed under order rule code of civil procedure the whole appeal was before it and if the appellate court is satisfied that additional evidence was not required we fail to understand as to how the high court could interfere with such an order under section code of civil procedure. in gurdev singh and ors. v. $$$ and anr. $$$ / sc/0887/$$$$$$$ / sc/0887/$$$$ scc this court on similar issue has expressed the view as under we have heard learned counsel for the parties. the grievance of the appellants before us is that in an appeal filed by them before the learned additional district judge ferozepur in an application under $$$ rule code of civil procedure code of civil procedure the learned additional district judge at the final hearing of the appeal wrongly felt that additional evidence was required to be produced as requested by the appellants by way of examination of a handwriting expert. the high court in the impugned order exercising jurisdiction under section code of civil procedure took the view that the order of the appellate court could not be sustained. in our view the approach of the high court in revision at that interim stage when the appeal was pending for final hearing before the learned additional district judge was not justified and the high court should not have interfered with the order which was within the jurisdiction of the appellate court. the reason is obvious. the appellate court hearing the matter finally could exercise jurisdiction way or the other under $$$ rule specially clause b. if the order was wrong on merits it would always be open for the respondent to challenge the same in accordance with law if an occasion arises to carry the matter in appeal after an appellate decree is passed. but at this interim stage the high court should not have felt itself convinced that the order was without jurisdiction. only on this short question without expressing any opinion on the merits of the controversy involved and on the legality of the contentions advanced by both the learned counsel for the parties regarding additional evidence we allow this appeal set aside the order of the high court. in view of the law laid down by this court as discussed above regarding exercise of revisional powers in the matter of allowing the application for additional evidence when appeal is pending before the lower appellate court the impugned order passed by the high court can not be upheld and the same is set aside. however to do complete justice between the parties we think it just and proper to direct the appellate court to decide the application for additional evidence afresh in the light of observations made by this court regarding principles on which such an application can be allowed or rejected. we order accordingly. we further clarify that we have not expressed any opinion as to the merits of the case. accordingly the appeal is disposed of. no order as to costs.
