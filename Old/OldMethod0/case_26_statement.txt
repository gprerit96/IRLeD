r.c. lahoti j. the high court of $$$ at hyderabad has by its impugned judgment dated april allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent national thermal power corporation ltd. hereinafter $$$ for short and declared that the levy of duty by the state of $$$ on the sales of electrical energy generated by the corporation -respondent no. at its thermal power station set up at $$$ within the state of $$$ and sold to the $$$ of karnataka kerala $$$ and the state of goa in pursuance of contracts of sales occasioning inter -state movement of electricity is incompetent and outside the power of state legislature. consequently the tax levied and collected has also been held to be without authority of law hence liable to the refunded in accordance with law. on a prayer made by the learned advocate general on behalf of the state of $$$ the high court certified that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of constitution under article. the appeal has been filed pursuant to the certificate so granted by the high court. on.a bench of learned judges directed the appeal to be placed for hearing before a constitution bench as required by $$$ of article of the constitution. at a point of time when this court was seized of the appeal filed by the state of $$$ $$$ moved a petition under article of the constitution seeking withdrawal of $$$ no. of $$$ v. state of madhya pradesh and anr. pending in the high court of madhya pradesh at jabalpur to this court. the prayer was allowed vide order dated.and on receipt of the records from high court of madhya pradesh the same has been registered here as t -c-/8. the state of madhya pradesh and newly formed state of $$$ with effect from.during the pendency of the petition were noticed and the parties thereto have been heard analogously with the hearing in c.a. no. however for convenience sake we will refer to states of madhya pradesh and $$$ as state of m.p. only as admittedly until the formation of new state the power stations in question were situated therein only.facts in c.a. no. $$$ electricity duty act provides for levy of duty on certain sales and consumption of electricity by licensees in the state of $$$. the definition of the term licensee specifically includes the national thermal power corporation respondent no. or any other corporation engaged in the business of supplying energy. section of the act is the charging section the relevant part whereof reads as under:-". $$$ of a duty in certain sales of electrical energy. save as otherwise provided in sub -section every licensee in the state of $$$ shall pay $$$$ to the state government in the prescribed manner a duty calculated at the rate of paise per unit of energy on and in respect of all sales of energy except sales to the government of india for consumption by that government or sales to the government of india or a railway company operating any railway for consumption in the construction maintenance or operation of that railway effected by the licensee during $$$$ at a price of more than paise per unit and on and in respect of all energy which was consumed by the licensee during $$$$ for purposes other than those connected with the construction maintenance and operation of his electrical undertaking and which if sold to a private consumer under like conditions would have fetched a price of more than paise per unit. provided that no duty under this sub -section shall be payable on and in respect of sale of energy effected:-(a by the $$$ state electricity board to any other licensee;(b by the national thermal power corporation to the $$$ state electricity board. a bare reading of the provision shows that duty is leviable at the prescribed rate on all sales of energy effected by the licensee during $$$$ at a price of more than paise per unit. duty is also leviable on all energy consumed by the licensee. there are certain categories of sales and consumption saved and excluded from what would otherwise have been dutiable. however in the present case we are not concerned with those exclusions nor with levy of duty on consumption. the limited question arising for our consideration is whether sales of energy by $$$ the respondent no. to several $$$ situated outside the state of $$$ and to the state of goa attract the incidence of taxation under section of the act. according to the facts found by the high court $$$ a government company wholly owned by the government of india has set up several super thermal power stations in different parts of the country normally located near coal -pit heads. such super thermal power station is set up in ramagundam in karimnagar district of the state of $$$. there are various transmission lines and sub -stations through which the power generated at ramagundam station is transmitted to the purchasers. the power generated is fed into the southern grid and is made available to the several state $$$ and the state of goa. these facts are not in controversy and sufficient to be taken note of for the purpose of this appeal. during the course of hearing by reference to certain documents it was sought to be pointed out where the meters are located within the state of m.p. or within the territories of buyer states or at both the places by reference to reading whereof the quantum of energy sold exported or imported is fixed and the price calculated. we do not propose to state the facts and contending submissions in that regard in details as it is unnecessary. the controversy centers mainly around the question as to under which entry $$$ electricity duty act is covered and whether the sales of electricity by $$$ the respondent no. to the $$$ situated outside the state of $$$ and to the state of goa can be construed as inter -state or inter -state sale.facts in t -c-/88. the relevant facts of this writ petition are briefly set out in what follows. the erstwhile central provinces and berar legislative assembly enacted the cp and berar electricity duty act which having been adapted in the state of madhya pradesh has come to be known as m.p. electricity duty act and extends to the whole of madhya pradesh. the preamble to the act as amended by madhya pradesh legislature provides that it is an act for the levy of duty on sale or consumption of electrical energy. the expression distributor of electrical energy is defined in $$$ of section to specifically include therein the national thermal power corporation section provides that every distributor of electrical energy and every producer shall subject to certain exceptions pay $$$$ to the state government at duty calculated at the rates specified in the table appended thereto on the units of electrical energy sold or supplied to a consumer or consumed by himself for his own purposes or for purposes of his township or colony during $$$$. the table appended to section prescribes different rates of duty depending on the purpose for which electrical energy is sold supplied or consumed the details whereof are not relevant for our purpose. there is yet another legislation namely the madhya pradesh $$$ no. of which provides for levy of certain cesses. sub -section of section thereof provides that every distributor of electrical energy shall pay to the state government an energy development cess at the rate of certain paise per unit on the total units of electrical energy sold or supplied to a consumer or consumed by himself or his employees during $$$$. ntpcl has power projects located in the state of madhya pradesh i korba super thermal power station at pragati nagar district bilaspur known as korba station presently in the state of $$$ and vindhyachal super thermal power station situated at vindhya nagar $$$ of madhya pradesh known as vindhyachal station. the electricity generated by it at these stations is fed into northern grid and supplied to several states outside the state of madhya pradesh pursuant to contracts entered into between the parties that is the seller and the buyers. on.the chief $$$ electricity duty and chief electrical inspector government of madhya pradesh issued a letter annexed by a tabulated statement raising a demand of rs. paise for the period commencing october and expiring march. the demand is on account of electricity duty at the rate of paise per unit and cess at the rate of paise per unit calculated on the units sold to $$$ of other states. in the counter -affidavit on behalf of the states of madhya pradesh and $$$ reliance has been placed on the definition of consumer engrafted into the m.p. electricity duty act by m.p. act no. of with effect from.which reads as under:-"consumer means any person who receives electrical energy sold or supplied by a distributor of electrical energy or a producer and includes a person receiving electrical energy in bulk for onward distribution. by the same amendment distributor of electrical energy was defined so as to include therein ntpcl as already stated. it is admitted by the state of m.p. and $$$ that the power generated at the power stations is old and supplied to various electricity boards / electricity departments situated in other states but as the generating stations are located in the state of madhya pradesh the sale is not an inter -state sale. the situs of sale is within the state of m.p. transaction of sale is complete in the state of m.p. and the buyers carry the electricity to their respective states when property in electricity sold has already passed to them. reliance has been placed on the several clauses of the bulk power supply agreement entered into between ntpcl and buyers of which entered into between ntpcl and western region electricity board wreb having its office at andheri east bombay has been filed and quoted in the counter affidavit according to which metering is within the state of m.p.transmission loss from madhya pradesh to the home state of the buyer is to the account of the buyer wheeling loss from madhya pradesh to the home state of the buyer to the account of the buyer transmission charges for transmission from madhya pradesh to the home state of the buyer to the account of the buyer wheeling charges from madhya pradesh to the home state of the buyer to the account of the buyer delivery of wreb in madhya pradesh g ntpcl cases to have control over the electrical energy once it is delivered to wreb within state of m.p.payment made by the bulk beneficiaries is in respect of quantum of electrical energy supplied / delivered at metering point in state of m.p. similar are the agreements entered into with other outside -state buyers. it is not disputed that the power generated at the abovesaid stations is fed into transmission system of power grid corporation of india limited and the transmission systems of other bulk power beneficiaries wherefrom the buyers draw the power purchased by them. great emphasis was aid on the fact that the points for metering are installed within the state of madhya pradesh. it was submitted that the transaction under scrutiny in the case of state of m.p. is different from the under scrutiny in the case of state of $$$.relevant provisions. we proceed to notice the relevant provisions of the constitution and other statutory provisions. changes of far reaching implications were

parliament may be law specify. out of the several changes introduced by the constitution amendment act only a few are relevant and material for our purpose. in article sub -clause g was added in $$$ and a new $$$ was added. the forty - amendment substituted the words ' sale or purchase of or consignment of goods in place of sale or purchase of goods as was occurring in $$$ inserted by amendment. such amendment has no relevance for the present controversy. in article subsequent to the amendment $$$ has been brought in the present form by - amendment which again is not relevant for the present controversy. what is relevant for our purpose is the deleting of former explanation appended to $$$ and substitution of $$$ in the present form in article by amendment. as to the several relevant entries quoted hereinabove it may be noted that entry in list -i of schedule was added by amendment. entry in list -ii in the present form was substituted by amendment. entries and in list -ii remain unaffected by amendment. the central sales tax act was enacted to formulate principles for determining -when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter -state trade or commerce or outside a state or in the course of import into or export from india to provide for the levy collection and distribution of taxes on sale of goods in the course of inter -state trade or commerce etc.as the preamble to the act states. $$$ d of section defines ' goods unless the context otherwise requires to include all materials articles commodities and all other kinds of moveable properties but not including newspapers actionable claims stocks shares and securities. section of the act placed in chapter thereof provides as under chapter iiformulation of principles fordetermining when a sale orpurchase of goods takes $$$ course of inter -state tradeor commerce or outside a stateor in the course of import orexport. when is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of inter -state trade or commerce. -a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of inter -state trade or commerce if the sale or purchase--(a occasions the movement of goods from state to another or(b is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from state to another.explanation. where goods are delivered to a carrier or other bailee for transmission the movement of the goods shall for the purpose of $$$ b be deemed to commence at the time of such delivery and terminate at the time when delivery is taken from such carrier or bailee.explanation. where the movement of goods commences and terminates in the same state it shall not be deemed to be a movement of goods from state to another by reason merely of the fact that in the course of such movement the goods pass through the territory of any other state. at this juncture it would be appropriate to have a view of the legislative history. explanation to $$$ of article generated some controversy which led to the constitution of a larger bench strength in the bengal immunity company limited v. the state of bihar and ors. -$$$ / sc/008/955$$$ / sc/008/955. the larger bench ruled by majority that an inter -state sale or purchase continues to be so irrespective of the state where the sale can be held to be located under the general law or by the fiction created by the explanation appended to $$$ of article. the situs of a sale or purchase is wholly irrelevant so far as its inter -state character is concerned. the larger bench further ruled that until parliament by law made in exercise of the powers vested in it by $$$ of article provides otherwise no state can impose or authorize the imposition of any tax on sale or purchase of goods when any sales or purchases take place in the course of inter -state trade or commerce. to put in other words it was held that explanation to article as it existed prior to the amendment could not be applied for the purpose of interpreting $$$ of article. the issue attracted the attention of taxation enquiry commission -tec for short. in its report volume iii. chapter vide para the commission observed inter alia that $$$ of article links the sales -tax to of the parties viz.the consumer and lays down that no state shall levy tax on a sale which results in delivery for consumption in another state. while making recommendations for consideration of future policy regarding sales tax it opined that the system should contain provisions whereby certain constitutional restrictions on the state and certain powers of levy and control by the union are introduced. the tec observed that the constitution in effect divides sales of goods in india into a goods delivered for consumption in particular states and other sales which dichotomy is imperfect from the point of view of tax administration. it suggested division both useful and effective of all sales of goods into namely those in the course of inter -state trade and commerce and those not in the course of such trade and commerce while the former should be the sphere of the union and the latter in the sphere of the states. it appears that so far as the electricity duty is concerned though the subject was separately dealt with by the report in the then circumstances the tec did not comprehend inter -state sale of electricity and therefore did not make any recommendation specifically in that regard. however that does not make any difference. pursuant to the recommendations made by the taxation enquiry commission the parliament incorporated certain amendments in the constitution by enacting the constitution amendment act which we have already noticed briefly. we have very briefly stated the legislative history for it has been noticed in details in a recent constitution bench decision of this court in century finance corporation ltd. and anr. v. state of maharashtra -$$$ / sc/02/$$$$$$$ / sc/02/$$$$ $$$ and earlier in $$$ dutt $$$ etc. v. union of india and anr. $$$ / sc/05/98$$$ / sc/05/98 and therefore we have deemed it not necessary to repeat or re -state the same in details. the central sales tax act was enacted by the parliament as authorized by the constitution. we have already reproduced section of the cst act hereinabove. by section of the act the central government was empowered to levy tax on all sales of goods effected by a dealer in the course of inter -state trade or commerce. however by the central sales tax amendment act which came into force with effect from.the language of section was suitably amended so as to confine the levy of tax under section on all sales of goods other than electrical energy. the statement of objects and reasons for this amendment was so stated exemption from central sales -tax act on inter -state sales of electrical energy is now dependent on the exemption form tax by a state government on local sales of electrical energy. it is now proposed to provide specifically that inter -state sale of electrical energy would not be liable to central sale tax.see gazette of india extraordinary part ii at page. the purpose behind referring to this amendment and the sor is that in the understanding of the parliament also the inter -state sale of electrical energy was liable to central sales -tax under section of the act and but for the amendment such tax was capable of being levied by the central government.electricity what it is21. before we deal with the constitutional aspects let us first state what electricity is as understood in law and what are its relevant characteristics. it is settled with the pronouncement of this court in commissir of sales tax madhya pradesh indore v. madhya pradesh electricity board jabalpur -$$$ / sc/0156/1968$$$ / sc/0156/1968 that electricity is goods. the definition of goods as given in article of the constitution was considered by this court and it was held that the definition in terms is very wide according to which goods means all kinds of moveable property. the term moveable property when considered with reference to goods as defined for the purpose of sales -tax can not be taken in a narrow sense and merely. because electrical energy is not tangible or can not be moved or touched like for instance a price of wood or a book it can not cease to be moveable property when it has all the attributes of such property. it is capable of abstraction consumption and use which if d dishstly is punishable under section of the indian electricity act. if there can be sale and purchase of electrical energy like any other moveable object this court held that there was no difficulty in holding that electric energy was intended to be covered by the definition of goods. however a.n. grover j. speaking for -judge bench of this court went on to observed that electric energy can be transmitted transferred delivered stored possessed etc. in the same way as any other moveable property. in this observation we agree with grover j. on all other characteristics of electric energy except that it can be stored and to the extent that electric energy can be stored the observation must be held to be errous or by oversight. the science and technology till $$$$ have not been able to evolve any methodology by which electric energy can be preserved or stored. another significant characteristic of electric energy is that its generation or production coincides almost instantaneously with its consumption. to quote from aiyar 's $$$ edition electricity in physics is the name given to the cause of a series of phenomena exhibited by various substances and also to the phenomena themselves.its true nature is not understood. $$$. quoted in spensley v. $$$. co.wis. nw where the court quoting from the same authority said we are totally ignorant of the nature of this cause whether it be a material agent or merely a property of matter. but as some hypothesis is necessary for explaining the phenomena observed it has been assumed to be a highly subtle imponderable fluid identical with lightning which pervades the pores of all bodies and is capable of motion from body to another.this characteristic quality of electric energy was judicially noticed in indian aluminium co. etc.etc. v. state of kerala and ors. $$$ / sc/070/1996$$$ / sc/070/1996. vide para this court has noted. continuity of supply and consumption starts from the moment the electrical energy passes through the meters and sale simultaneously takes place as soon as meter reading is recorded. all the steps or phases i. sale supply and consumption take place without any hiatus. it is true that from the place of generating electricity the electricity is supplied to the sub -station installed at the units of the consumers through electrical higher -tension transformers and from there electricity is supplied to the meter. but the moment electricity is supplied through the meter consumption and sale simultaneously take place... as soon as the electrical energy is supplied to the consumers and is transmitted through the meter consumption takes place simultaneously with the supply. there is no hiatus in its operation. simultaneously sale also takes place.these properties of electricity as goods are of immense relevance as we would state hereafter.$$$ entries and how to be read:2. we now come to the question on the interpretation of entry in $$$ of schedule. it provides for taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity. the word sale as occurring in entry came up for the consideration of this court in burmah shell oil storage & distributing co. india ltd. v. the belgaum borough municipality $$$ / sc/014/1962$$$ / sc/014/1962 air196sc906. it was held that the act of sale is merely the means for putting the goods in the way of use or consumption. it is an earlier stage the ultimate destination of the goods being use or consumption. we feel that the same meaning should be assigned to the word sale in entry. this is for a fortiorari reason in the context of electricity as there can be no sale of electricity excepting by its consumption for it can neither be preserved nor stored. it is this property of electricity which persuaded this court in indian aluminium co. etc 's caseh supra to hold that in the context of electricity the word supply should be interpreted to include sale or consumption of electricity. entry should therefore be read as taxes on the consumption or sale for consumption of electricity. with these things in mind that electricity is goods and that sale of electricity has to be construed and read as sale for consumption within the meaning of entry the conflict if any between entry and entry ceases to exist and the can be harmonized and read together. because electricity is goods it is covered in entry also. it is not disputed that duty on electricity is tax. tax on the sale or purchase of goods including electricity but excluding newspapers shall fall within entry and shall be subject to provisions of entry of list i. taxes on the consumption or sale for consumption of electricity within the meaning of entry must be consumption within the state and not beyond the territory of the state. any other sale of electricity shall continue to be subject to the limits provided by entry. even purchase of electricity would be available for taxation which it would not be if electricity was not includible in the meaning of term goods. a piece of legislation need not necessarily fall within the scope of entry al more than entry may overlap to cover the subject -matter of a single piece of legislation. a bare consumption of electric energy even by who generates the same may be liable to be taxed by reference to entry and if the state legislature may choose to impose tax on consumption of electricity by the who generates it such tax would not be deemed to be a tax necessarily on manufacture or production or a duty of exercise as held by constitution bench in jiyajeerao cotton mills ltd $$$ gwalior v. state of madhya pradesh -$$$ / sc/0266/1961$$$ sc/0266/1961 air196sc414. a mere consumption of goods other than electricity not accompanied by purchase or sale would not be taxable under entry because it does not provide for taxes on the consumption and entry does not speak of goods other than electricity. thus in substance entries and can be and must be read together and to the extent of sale of electricity for consumption outside the state the electricity being goods shall also be subject to provisions of entry of list i. this in our opinion is the best way of reading the entries. in c.p. motor spirit act re.air fc it was hold that entries in the lists may overlap and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other. it is then the duty of this court to reconcile the entries and bring about harmony between them. the court should strive at searching for reasonable and practical construction to seek reconciliation and give effect to all of them. if reconciliation proves impossible the overriding power of union legislature operates and prevails. gwyer c.j. observed -a grant of the power in general terms standing by itself would no doubt be construed in the wider sense but it may be qualified by other express provisions in the same enactment by the implication of the context and even by considerations arising out of what appears to be the general scheme of the act.and again he said...an endeavour must be made to solve it as the judicial committee have said by having recourse to the context and scheme of the act and a reconciliation attempted between apparently conflicting jurisdictions by reading the entries together and by interpreting and where necessary modifying the language of the by that of the other. if needed such a reconciliation should prove impossible then and only then will the non -obstante clause operate and the federal power prevail.in calcutta gas co. ltd. v. the state of west bengal and ors. $$$ / sc/006/1962$$$ / sc/006/1962 air1962sc1044 the constitution bench has held that the same rules of construction apply for the purpose of harmonizing an apparent conflict between entries in the same list.what is inter -state sale?25. it is well settled by a catena of decisions of this court that a sale in the course of inter -state trade has essential ingredients there must be a contract of sale incorporating a stipulation express or implied regarding inter -state movement of goods the goods must actually move from state to another pursuant to such contract of sale the sale being the proximate cause of movement and such movement of goods must be from state to another state where the sale concludes. it follows as a necessary corollary of these principles that a movement of goods which takes place independently of a contract of sale would not fall within the meaning of inter -state sale. in other words. if there is no contract of sale preceding the movements of goods obviously the movement can not be attributed to the contract of sale. similarly if the transaction of sale stands completed within the state and the movement of goods takes place thereafter it would obviously be independently of the contract of sale and necessarily by or on behalf of the purchaser al and therefore the transaction would not be having an inter -state element. $$$ are legion we may briefly refer to some of them. in english electric company of india ltd. v. deputy commercial tax officer $$$ / sc/09/16$$$ / sc/09/16 this court held that when the movement of the goods from state to another is an incident of the contract it is a sale in the course of inter -state sale and it does not matter which is the state in which the property passes. what is decisive is whether the sale is which occasions the movement of goods from state to another. in union of india v. k.g. khosla and co. ltd.$$$ / sc/044/19$$$ / sc/044/19 it was observed that a sale would be an inter -state sale even if the contract of sale does not itself provide for the movement of goods from state to another provided however that such movements was the result of a covenant in the contract of sale or was an incident of the contract. similar view was expressed in m / s. sahney steel and press works ltd. and anr. v. commercial tax officer and others $$$ / sc/0/1985$$$ / sc/0/1985 air1985sc1754. in manganese ore india ltd. v. the regional assistant commissir of sales -tax $$$ / sc/049/15$$$ / sc/049/15 after referring to $$$ v. state of orissa $$$ / sc/0441/15$$$ / sc/0441/15 it was observed that so far as section of the c.s.t. act is concerned there is no distinction between unascertained or future goods which are already in existence if at time when the sale takes place these goods have come into actual existence.effect of entry- list -ii having remained unamended26. having seen the properties of electricity as goods and what is inter -state sale let us examine the effect of entry $$$ having been left unamended by sixth amendment from another angle. sixth amendment did not touch entry in list -ii and so the contents of entry were not expressly made subject to the provisions of entry a of list i and arguments were advanced with emphasis on behalf of the states of andhra pradesh and madhya pradesh contending that such omission was deliberate and therefore the restriction which has been placed only in entry by making it subject to the provisions of entry of list i should not be read in entry. it was submitted that so far as sale of electricity is concerned even if such sale takes place in the course of inter -state trade or commerce the state can legislate to tax such sale if the sale can be held to have taken place within the territory of that state or if adequate territorial nexus is established between the transaction and state legislation. for the several reasons stated hereinafter such a plea can not be countenanced. the prohibition which is imposed by article of the constitution is independent of the legislative entries in schedule. after the decision of larger bench in bengal immunity company limited supra and constitution bench decision in ram narian sons ltd. and ors. v. asst. commissir of sales tax and ors. $$$ / sc/0084/1955$$$ / sc/0084/1955 there is no manner of doubt that the bans imposed by $$$ and on the taxation powers of the state are independent and separate and must be got over before a state legislature can impose tax on transaction s of sale or purchase of goods. needless to say such ban would operate by its own force and irrespective of the language in which in entry in list -ii of schedule has been couched. the dimension given to field of legislation by the language of an entry in list -ii schedule shall always remain subject to the limits of constitutional empowerment to legislate and can never afford to spill over the barriers created by the constitution. the power of state legislature to enact law to levy tax by reference to list ii of the schedule has limitations arising out of the entry itself and the other flowing from the restriction embodied in the constitution. it was held in tata iron and steel co. ltd. bombay v. s.r. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0270/1960$$$ / sc/0270/1960 that field of taxation on sale or purchase taking place in the course of inter -state trade or commerce has been excluded from the competence of the state legislature. in century finance corporation limited supra the constitution bench majority made it clear that the situs of the sale or purchase is wholly immaterial as regards the inter -state trade or commerce. in view of section of the central sales tax all that has to be seen is whether the sale or purchase a occasions the movement of goods from state to another or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods daring their movement from state to another. if the transaction of sale satisfies any of the requirements it shall be deemed to be a sale or purchase of good sin the course of inter -state trade or commerce and by virtue of $$$ and of the constitution the same shall be beyond the legislative competence of a state to tax without regard to the fact whether such a prohibitions spelled out by the description of a legislative entry in schedule or not. it is well settled and hardly needs any authority to support the proposition that several entries in the lists of schedule are legislative heads or fields of legislation and not the source of legislative empowerment. to wit see the calcutta gas co. ltd. v. the state of west bengal and ors. supra. competence to legislate has to be traced to the constitution. the division of powers between parliament and the state legislatures to legislate by reference to territorial limits is defined by article. the subject -matters with respect to which those powers can be exercised are enumerated in the several entries divided into groups as lists of schedule. $$$ powers of legislation are also vested by article in the parliament with respect to any matter not enumerated in any of the lists in schedule. this residuary power finds reflected in entry of list i. if an entry does not spell out an exclusion from field of legislation discernible on its apparent reading the absence of exclusion can not be read as enabling power to legislate in the field not specifically excluded more so when there is available a specific provision in the constitution prohibiting such legislation. it is by reference to the ambit or limits of territory by which the legislative powers vested in parliament and the state legislatures are divided in article. generally speaking a legislation having extra territorial operation can be enacted only by parliament and not by any state legislature possibly the only exception being where extra territorial operation of a state legislation is sustainable on the ground of territorial nexus. such territorial nexus when pleaded must be sufficient and real and not illusory. in burmah shell oil storage & distributing co. india ltd. supra which we have noticed it was held that sale for use or consumption would mean the goods being brought inside the area for sale to an ultimate consumer i. the who consumes. in entry sale for consumption the meaning which we have placed on the word sale would mean a sale for consumption within the state so as to bring a state legislation within the field of entry. if sale and consumption were to take place in different states territorial nexus for the state where the sale takes place would be lost. we have already noticed that in case of electricity the events of sale and consumption are inseparable. any state legislation levying duty on sale of electricity by artificially or fictionally assuming that the events of sale and consumption have taken place in states would be vitiated because of extra territorial operation of state legislation. in century finance corporation 's case the constitution bench by reference to the definition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods which too has been inserted as $$$ 29-a in article by sixth amendment opined that the situs of sale can be fixed either by the appropriate legislature or by judge made law and no settled principles for determining situs of sale can be laid down. further the state legislature can not by law treat sales outside the state and sales in the course of import as sales within the state by fixing the situs of sales within its state in the definition of sale as it is within the exclusive domain of the appropriate legislature i. parliament to fix the location of sale by creating legal fiction or otherwise. the majority has clearly opined that the state where the goods are delivered in the transaction of inter -state sale can not levy a tax on the basis that of the events in the chain has taken place within the state so also where the goods are in existence and available for the transfer of right to use there also that state can not exercise power to tax merely because the goods are located in that state. then it was observed that in case where goods are not in existence or where there is an oral or implied transfer of the right to use the goods such transactions may be effected by the delivery of the goods in which case the taxable event would be on the delivery of goods. however we are dealing with the case of electricity as goods the property whereof as we have already noted is that the production generation transmission delivery and consumption are simultaneous almost instantaneous. electricity as goods comes into existence and is consumed simultaneously the event of sale in the sense of transferring property in the goods merely intervenes as a step between generation and consumption. in such a case when the generation takes place in state wherefrom it is supplied and it is received in another state where it is consumed the entire transaction is and can be nothing else excepting an inter -state sale on account of instantaneous movement of goods from state to another occasid by the sale or purchase of goods squarely covered by section of c.s.t. act.sale of electricity by ntpcl1. in both the cases before us contracts have been entered into between parties to the transaction that is the sellers and the buyers in other states prior to the generation of electricity. the ntpcl generates electricity and pursuant to these contracts supplies the same from its power stations situated in the states of a.p. or m.p. to the buyers in other states where it is received and consumed. there is no hiatus between generation sale supply transmission delivery and consumption. the inter -state movement of electricity is pursuant to contracts of sale. such sales can be held only as inter -state sales. though it may be permissible to fix the situs of sale wither by appropriate state legislation or by judge made law as held by the majority opinion in $$$$ finance corporation case we would like to clarify that n of the can artificially appoint a situs of sale so as to create territorial nexus attracting applicability of tax legislation enacted by any state legislature and tax an inter -state sale in breach of section of the cst act read with $$$ and and of the constitution. no state legislation nor any stipulation in any contract can fix the situs of sale within the state or artificially define the completion of sale in such a way as to convert an inter -state sale into an intra -state sale or create a territorial nexus to tax an inter -state sale unless permitted by an appropriate central legislation. but this is exactly what the definition of consumer in clause 2)(a of the m.p. electricity duty act has d. the definition of consumer has been artificially extended to include any person who receives electrical energy without regard to its consumption and also to include a person who receiving the electrical energy in bulk forwards it onwards for distribution without regard to the fact whether it transmitted outside the state and whether the electricity is or is not consumed within the state. the same definition has been adopted in m.p. $$$. this definition of consumer shall have to be read down as including within it only such persons who receive the electricity for consumption or distribution for consumption within the state. without such reading down the definition of consumer would be rendered ultra vires of $$$ and of the constitution read with section of the central sales tax act.consequences on free flow of trade. yet another reason why we can not accept the line of reasoning advanced on behalf of the state of andhra pradesh and madhya pradesh is that the same runs counter to the scheme of constitutional provisions and specially the sixth amendment. as has been found by the division bench of andhra pradesh high court in its impugned judgment if the reasoning suggested on behalf of the state of a.p. was accepted the state where the dealer supplying the electricity is located and the electricity originates for sale as also the states in which the purchaser of electricity is located and it is delivered shall both subject the electrical energy to taxation by relying on the theory of territorial nexus. such a situation would be the which was obtaining in the country with respect to sales tax prior to coming into force of the constitution and which led to complications and difficulties in administration of sales tax legislation and therefore was taken care of by the sixth amendment. such multiple taxation would result in hampering free movement of electricity between the states and therefore would be prejudicial to freedom of trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of india and for the unity and integrity of the country. that would give rise to the same situation which was sought to be remedied by the constitution and the sixth amendment. on behalf of the states of a.p. and m.p.it was submitted that subject of electricity has been specifically dealt with by $$$ and of the constitution and by implication the $$$ other than and should be read as not dealing with electricity. this submission is stated only to be rejected. these articles make some provisions for electricity and water or electricity in the special context dealt with by those articles and do not exclude applicability of other articles where electricity has been dealt with as goods. for the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that no fault can be found with the judgment of the andhra pradesh high court which is affirmed and civil appeal no. of is dismissed with costs. civil writ petition t.c. no. of is allowed with costs and the demand raised by the chief electrical electricity duty and chief electrical inspector government of m.p. vide its letter dated.is directed to be quashed.
