alternatively the hon'ble central commission may suspend the operation of the ppas till the final disposal of the application;e pass such further or other orders as the hon'ble central commission may deem just and proper in the circumstances of the case. the substance of the petition is that due to various reasons stated by the $$$ in its petition the $$$ will not be able to supply power to respondents no. to at the rates agreed between the $$$ and those respondents by the abovementioned ppas. therefore the $$$ sought the abovementioned reliefs. the $$$ submitted before the central commission that he is entitled for the various reliefs on distinct grounds they are:. that the subsequent events qualify as force majeure as per article of the ppas therefore the contracts are frustrated;. that the subsequent events tantamount to change of law as contemplated under article of the ppas therefore the $$$ is relieved of its obligation to perform the contracts and. that the central commission has power to grant appropriate relief to the $$$ in exercise of its regulatory powers under section of the act by making necessary modifications in the terms of the ppas. by order dated.the central commission rejected the of the abovementioned submissions and accepted the submission giving certain directions for the constitution of a committee for working out and recommending the compensatory tariff and to submit a report to the commission by.. the order was admittedly received by the $$$ on.. aggrieved by the said order respondents no. and herein preferred appeal no. of before the appellate tribunal alongwith an application to permit them to participate in the proceedings of the above -mentioned committee without prejudice to their contentions in the appeal. on.the committee submitted its report before the central commission. eventually the central commission passed an order dated.quantifying the compensatory tariff. the appeal filed by respondents no. and underwent a number of adjournments and is still pending. on.the $$$ herein filed cross -objections in the abovementioned appeal no. of challenging that part of the order dated.of the central commission by which the commission declined to accept the pleas of the $$$ on the grounds of force majeure and change of law. on.respondents no. and preferred appeal no. of challenging the correctness of the order dated.of the central commission. respondent no. also preferred appeal no. of aggrieved by the order dated.. by order dated.the appellate tribunal dismissed the cross -objections of the $$$ herein as not maintainable. on.the $$$ preferred appeal no. dfr no. of before the appellate tribunal against that part of the order dated.which went against the $$$. obviously there was a delay in preferring that appeal. therefore the $$$ filed an application bearing ia no. of seeking condonation of delay in preferring the appeal which was rejected by the impugned order. hence the instant appeal. the issue before this $$$ is limited. it is the correctness of the decision of the appellate tribunal in declining to condone the delay in preferring the appeal against order dated.of the central commission. however elaborate submissions were made regarding the scope of order xli rule of the code of civil procedure for short code of civil procedure its applicability to an appeal under section of the act by the $$$ relying upon earlier decisions of this $$$. respondents submitted that such an enquiry is wholly uncalled for as the cross -objections of the $$$ in appeal no. of stood rejected and became final. lastly learned counsel for the $$$ submitted that even if this $$$ comes to the conclusion that the $$$ has not made out a case for condonation of delay in preferring an appeal against the order dated.of the central commission the $$$ is entitled to argue in the pending appeals no. and of both the grounds of force majeure and change of law not for the purpose of seeking the relief of a declaration of the frustration of the contracts between the $$$s and the respondents thereby relieving the $$$ of his obligations arising out of the contracts but only for the purpose of seeking the alternative relief of compensatory tariff. in other words the $$$ 's submission is that the facts which formed the basis of the submission of the frustration of contracts are also relevant for supporting the conclusion of the national commission that the $$$ is entitled for the relief of compensatory tariff. we agree with the respondents that we are not required to go into the question of the applicability of order xli rule in the instant appeal as the decision of the appellate tribunal to reject the cross -objections of the $$$ by its order dated.has become final and no appeal against the said order is pending before us. we are also not required to go into the question whether the order of the central commission dated.by which it declined to grant a declaration of frustration of the contracts either on the ground of force majeure or on the ground of change of law is independently appealable since no such appeal even if maintainable is preferred by the $$$. the question whether the $$$ made out a case for condonation of delay in preferring the appeal before the appellate tribunal in our opinion need not also be examined by us in view of the last submission made by the $$$. if the $$$ is not desirous of seeking a declaration that the $$$ is relieved of the obligation to perform the contracts in question the correctness of the decision of the appellate tribunal in rejecting the application to condone the delay in preferring the appeal would become purely academic. we are of the opinion that so long as the $$$ does not seek a declaration such as the one mentioned above the $$$ is entitled to argue any proposition of law be it force majeure or change of law in support of the order dated.quantifying the compensatory tariff the correctness of which is under challenge before the appellate tribunal in appeal no. of and appeal no. of preferred by the respondents so long as such an argument is based on the facts which are already pleaded before the central commission. the appeal is accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs.para. accordingly we direct the $$$ and the respondents and the respective state governments to constitute a committee within week from the date of this order. the committee shall consist of the principal secretary power govt. of haryana / managing directors of uhbvnl and dhbvnl the chairman of adani power ltd. or his nominee an independent financial analyst of repute and an eminent banker of the commensurate level. the nominees of financial analysts and banker should be selected on mutual consent basis. the committee shall go into the impact of the price escalation of the indonesian coal on the project viability and obtain all the actual data required with due authentication from independent auditors to ascertain the cost of import of coal from indonesia and suggest a package for compensatory tariff which can be allowed to the $$$ over and above the tariff in the ppas. the committee shall keep in view inter -alia the following considerations while working out and recommending the compensatory tariff applicable upto a certain period:(a the net profit less govt. taxes and cess etc. earned by the $$$ 's company from the coal mines in indonesia on account of the bench mark price due to indonesian regulation corresponding to the quantity of the coal being supplied to the mundra power project should be factored to pass on the same in full to the beneficiaries in the compensatory tariff.the possibility of sharing the revenue due to sale of power beyond the target availability of mundra power project to the parties may be explored.the possibility of using coal with a low gcv for generation of electricity for supply to the respondents without affecting the operational efficiency of the generating stations.para. the committee is also at liberty to suggest any further measures which would be practicable and commercially sensible to address the situation. the committee shall submit its report to the commission by 30th april for consideration and for further directions.
