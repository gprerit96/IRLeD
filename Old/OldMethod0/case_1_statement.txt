abhay manohar sapre j. delay in filing special leave petition is condoned. leave granted. this appeal is filed against the final judgment and order dated.of the high court of judicature at patna in cwjc no. of whereby the high court while disposing of the $$$ 's writ petition granted liberty to file representation to the national thermal power corporation ntpc but at the same time passed an order that the $$$s will have no liberty to move the high court again for the same cause of action raised therein. we have heard learned counsel for the $$$ and have perused the record of the case. having heard learned counsel for the $$$ we are inclined to dispose of this appeal after granting leave at the admission stage itself as we are of the view that the same can be disposed of without notice to the other side. in the light of the order that we have passed it is neither necessary to set out the facts of the case in detail and as mentioned above nor necessary to issue notice of this appeal to the other side. the impugned order passed by the high court reads as under after some arguments learned counsel for the $$$s seeks permission to withdraw this application in order to enable the $$$s to file representation before the competent authority of the national thermal power corporation ntpc. while this court would accord such leave to the $$$ but it is made clear that the $$$s will have now no liberty to move this court again for the same cause of action raised herein. the only grievance of learned counsel for the $$$ is that the high court having rightly granted liberty to the $$$ to file the representation for ventilating his grievance before the ntpc erred in taking away his right to prosecute his grievance if occasion arises in future depending upon the outcome of his representation. it is his submission that the $$$ has every right to take recourse to all legal remedies as are available to him in law in the event any adverse order is passed on his representation or when no orders are passed on his representation once made. we find force in this submission. in our considered view the high court having rightly granted indulgence to the $$$ to file the representation to the ntpc for ventilating his grievance should have also granted liberty to the $$$ to take recourse to all legal remedies to challenge the decision once taken on his representation if occasion so arises. a right to prosecute the legal remedy in the court of law to challenge any decision of the state or / and its agency is a valuable legal right of the citizen and the high court could not take away such right from the appellant without assigning any reason. there is apparently no justifiable reason to deny the appellant from taking recourse to the legal remedies to prosecute his grievance in a court of law in relation to the dispute which is the subject matter of the representation in case if occasion arises in future. in the light of foregoing discussion we allow the appeal in part and set aside that part of the impugned order which deprives the appellant to move to the court again in the event his representation is decided against him by the ntpc. we therefore grant the appellant further liberty to take recourse to all legal remedies as may be available to him in law by approaching appropriate court to ventilate his grievance if occasion arises in relation to the dispute for which he is granted liberty by the high court to file the representation.
