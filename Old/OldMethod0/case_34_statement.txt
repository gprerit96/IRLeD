$$$ j. these appeals have been argued over $$$$ but ultimately the points raised in them lie within a narrow compass. on.the central government in exercise of powers under section of the electricity act issued guidelines for a tariff based competitive bid process to be initiated by distribution licensees / procurers for procurement of power from generating companies. the electricity to be procured by such procurers is for the purpose of distribution and retail supply to consumers generally. on.in pursuance of these guidelines procurers in different states namely appellants to and respondents to in civil appeal nos. -of nominated power finance corporation limited a government of india undertaking as the nodal agency to complete a competitive bid process for development of an ultra mega power project based on linked coalmines using super critical technology of units of mega watts mw each plus or minus % in sasan district singrauli madhya pradesh. on.sasan power limited was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle by power finance corporation in order to implement the aforesaid purpose. on.based on the competitive bidding process held by power finance corporation reliance power limited having quoted the lowest amount was selected as the successful bidder and a letter of intent was issued to reliance power ltd. the quoted tariff $$$$ by $$$$ for a period of $$$$s which was accepted and incorporated as schedule in the power purchase agreement dated.ppa had tariffs at an extremely depressed rate for the years after which the tariffs were fixed at a significantly higher rate. on $$$$ that the ppa was executed between sasan power limited and the procurers for generation and sale of electricity % share holding of the special purpose vehicle was acquired by reliance power limited. the ppa contains detailed clauses with respect to generation of power and the tariffs payable for the period of years. apart from other provisions we are really concerned with $$$ read with schedule which provides for pre -conditions to be satisfied for declaration of a generating unit as commercial operation date cod namely readiness to commence commercial operations. this happens only when a performance test by operating the generating unit at % of the contracted capacity as existing on the effective date on a continuous running basis for hours has been certified by an independent engineer by giving a final test certificate to the aforesaid effect. the ppa also contains various other clauses which will be set out during the course of this judgment. the b of contention in these matters is whether the cod for $$$ no. which was the $$$ to be commissid had been achieved on.. if it had then under schedule to the ppa $$$$ would get exhausted in $$$$ i.$$$$ being the end of the contract year for which tariff payable would be at the rate of paise per unit. if not then it is only on and from the commencement of cod that $$$$ would begin which according to the appellants before us would only begin on.when a final test certificate in accordance with $$$ of the ppa was given by the independent engineer to the effect that % of the contracted capacity had been achieved for a continuous period of hours. we are informed that if the cod is said to be on.as has been held by the appellate tribunal the consumers would have to pay a sum of over crores being the differential tariff that would apply. the date for commissioning the unit was fixed under the ppa as $$$$. however under schedule thereof $$$$ was prepd to th november. as sasan kept postponing $$$$ it appears that the commissioning tests for generating $$$ no. commenced from.. various emails were exchanged from.to.between sasan and the western region load dispatch centre hereinafter referred to as the wrldc a statutory authority under the electricity act. it is the case of sasan that though they were ready to deliver electricity on.at % of the contracted capacity of mw of the unit they could not do so as wrldc did not give them the necessary green signal to go ahead. they relied heavily upon the independent engineer 's test certificate dated.to show that a cod took place on $$$$ which we will consider in some detail later. at this stage suffice it to say that a petition was filed by wrldc before the central electricity regulatory commission cerc on.in which it was prayed:. kindly look into the veracity of the certificate issued by the independent $$$ in view of deliberate suppression and misrepresentation of the facts and issue suitable directions to respondent no. to desist from such act. kindly look into the matter of respondent no. including into intentional mis -declaration of parameters related to commercial mechanism in vogue and has purported to declare the part de -rated capacity of.mw as commercial on the grounds of load restriction by wrldc and issued suitable directions in the matter. issue specific guidelines with respect to declaration of cod of the generators who are not governed by the cerc terms and conditions of tariff regulations to be in line with cerc regulations so that the same can be implemented in a dispute free manner and eliminate any possibility of gaming by generator. hon'ble commission may give any further directions as deemed fit in the circumstances of the case. this petition was allowed by the cerc by its order dated.by which it set out issues as follows:(a whether the petition filed by wrldc is maintainable?(b whether the certificate issued by ie is in accordance with the ppa and if not whether ie has made deliberate suppression or misrepresentation of facts while issuing the certificate?(c whether cod of the station as declared by spl is in accordance with the ppa?(d whether the respondent no. has indulged in mis -declaration of parameters relating to commercial mechanism in vogue?(e guidelines with regard to the commercial operation of a generating station which is not regulated by the tariff regulations of the commission. the cerc answered issues a c and in the affirmative and issue d in the negative. ultimately the commission arrived at the conclusion that cod had not been achieved on.but had only been achieved later on $$$$ of the same year. this finding was set aside by the appellate tribunal by its judgment dated.in which the appellate tribunal found that though cod had not been achieved on.in accordance with the ppa but that the procurers under the ppa had waived their right to demand performance at % and that the performance of $$$ no. which was only roughly % of its contracted capacity was accepted by all the procurers and that therefore there was a waiver of this essential condition which would then entitle the generator to treat.as the date on which commercial operation of $$$ no. commenced. it is the correctness of this judgment which has been assailed by the various appellants before us. mr. jayant bhushan learned senior counsel mr. $$$ learned senior counsel mr. m.g. $$$ learned counsel mr. purusha indra kavrar learned aag and mr. $$$ learned counsel appearing for the appellants have relied heavily on $$$.read with schedule of the ppa and stated that this is an $$$ which does not merely reflect the individual rights and liabilities of the generator and procurers of electricity but would also sound in public interest inasmuch as the declaration of cod would have effect on the tariff that is payable by consumers generally. they therefore argued that $$$.can not be waived as a matter of law. they also argued that it can not also be waived as a matter of fact inasmuch as when the ppa expressly allowed a certain provision to be waived it expressly stated so. in this regard $$$s...were pointed out by them. referring to $$$.of the ppa it was argued that the said $$$ is not a substantive provision for waiver but only a provision dealing with the manner in which waiver is to be exercised and has reference only to the aforesaid $$$s. further even assuming that there was a waiver such waiver took place as late as.when the last communication from uttarakhand power was received. there was therefore no waiver of the aforesaid condition on.. they also argued that as a matter of fact the emails exchanged between the parties would show that the lead procurer and all the other procurers had in fact never consented to.as being the cod for the purpose of the ppa. they also argued that really speaking any such alleged waiver was not a waiver at all but an amendment to the ppa which would require the commission 's consent under article.inasmuch as it would affect the tariff payable by consumers. they also argued that it is clear from a reading of a chart which showed generation from march to $$$$ that sasan was not able to achieve anywhere near % of contracted capacity until $$$$ which is when the cod took place on facts. they also pointed out that for example in $$$$ there was no supply of power at all by sasan power. ultimately it was stated that the independent $$$ 's certificate dated.was a document made only to favour sasan so that sasan could swallow entire year of tariff in $$$$ so that the consumer would have to pay the higher tariff for what is in reality $$$$ but is now being treated as $$$$ of generation and supply. as against this shri chidambaram and $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of sasan power ltd.have argued that as against and paise per unit for electricity supplied under the ppa the procurers were in fact procuring electricity at much higher rates. it was the procurers themselves therefore who kept telling sasan to supply power as soon as possible. for this they relied in particular on the minutes of a meeting dated.between the procurers and sasan in which the procurers unequivocally stated that any time upto.the power generation should begin from $$$ no. this was because the moment such power generation began whether it was paise or paise for $$$$ the aforesaid tariff was much much lower than what the procurers would have to pay otherwise. it was their argument that it was only at the behest of the procurers themselves that the cod was declared on.. they further argued that on a correct reading of emails and letters exchanged between the parties the lead procurer and all other procurers had actually and unequivocally waived the requirement of % of contracted capacity demand and that the appellate tribunal was right in this behalf. countering the arguments of the appellant they referred to and relied upon section of the indian contract act to buttress their submission that waiver is a right granted by the contract act and does not depend upon the ppa. therefore whatever the construction of article.of the ppa it is clear that the contract act itself gives them this right which the procurers themselves have exercised in accordance with law for the very good reason that they wanted the supply of cheap energy at any cost even at the cost of being at % instead of % of contracted demand. it was also their case that they were ready to supply electricity on $$$$ at % of the contracted demand but unfortunately wrldc prevented them from doing so and that the independent engineer 's certificate had been wrongly castigated by cerc as was correctly held by the appellate tribunal. the independent engineer laid bare the facts correctly and therefore did not give a false or wrong certificate as was found by cerc. they also met an argument raised by the appellant that haryana at least had waived its right without prejudice to its other rights and contentions. this was met by stating that haryana accounted only for roughly % of the total electricity demanded by all the procurers and that as per a $$$ in the ppa if the lead procurer and the other procurers constitute % or more they can bind all the other procurers. in order to appreciate the rival submissions it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the ppa which reads as follows:. definitionsthe terms used in this agreement unless as defined below or repugnant to the context shall have the same meaning as assigned to them by the

notwithstanding anything contained in section the appropriate commission shall adopt the tariff if such tariff has been determined through transparent process of bidding in accordance with the guidelines issued by the central government. since counsel for the opposing parties have made wide ranging arguments on the effect of article and waiver as a legal concept it is important to find out as to which pigeonhole the facts of the present case fit -whether the emails exchanged by the parties would amount to an amendment governed by article.or whether it would amount to a waiver governed by article.. a perusal of the emails exchanged between the parties would show that the parties did not intend to amend by a written agreement any of the provisions of the ppa. whereas an amendment of the ppa under article.would be bilateral a waiver of a provision of the ppa would be unilateral under article.. in order to better understand conceptually the difference between amendment and waiver it is necessary to advert to sections and of the indian contract act.section. short title.act may be called the indian contract act.extent commencements.extends to the whole of india except the state of jammu and kashmir and it shall come into force on the day of september.nothing herein contained shall affect the provisions of any statute act or regulation not hereby expressly repealed nor any usage or custom of trade nor any incident of any contract not inconsistent with the provisions of this act.section. effect of novation rescission and alteration of contract.if the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new contract for it or to rescind or alter it the original contract need not be performed.section. promisee may dispense with or remit performance of promise.-every promise may dispense with or remit wholly or in part the performance of the promise made to him or may extend the time for such performance or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. under section apart from novation of a contract and rescission of a contract alteration of a contract is mentid. alteration is understood here in the facts of the present case in the sense of amendment. it is settled law that an amendment to a contract being in the nature of a modification of the terms of the contract must be read in and become a part of the original contract in order to amount to an alteration under section of the indian contract act. this is clear from $$$ v. n.v. internationale crediet -en -handels vereeninging rotterdam ' $$$ / wb/00/$$$ / wb/00/ air cal in paragraph of which it is stated the effect of the alterations or modifications is that there is a new arrangement in the language of $$$ in $$$ v. baron & co. appeal cases at a new contract containing as an entirety the old terms together with and as modified by the new terms incorporated.the modifications are read into and become part and parcel of the original contract. the original terms also continue to be part of the contract and are not rescinded and/or superseded except in so far as they are inconsistent with the modifications. those of the original terms which can not make sense when read with the alterations must be rejected. in my view the arbitration $$$ in this case is in no way inconsistent with the subsequent modifications and continues to subsist. para. no such thing having occurred on the present facts it is clear that there is in fact no amendment by written agreement to the ppa. to this extent learned counsel for sasan are correct. the relevant section therefore that would apply on the facts of the present case is section. at this stage it is important to advert to an argument made by counsel for the appellants that article.only refers to waivers that can expressly be made under various provisions of the agreement and not to article which according to learned counsel can not be waived under the ppa. assuming that such argument is correct and that article.refers only to the mode of carrying out a waiver under the ppa yet it is clear that section would operate on the facts of this case. this is for the reason that when read with section of the contract act it becomes clear that the ppa is subject to section of the contract act which would allow a promise to dispense with or remit wholly or in part the performance of the promise made to him and accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. this is made clear in an interesting judgment by chief justice st in official assignee of bombay v. $$$ bom. the learned chief justice after setting out the facts had this to say on the effect of section of the contract act the indian contract act of applies to all contracts in india and with regard to a pawn is a codification of the english common law. speaking of the common law right to sell mr. justice story in his commentaries on the law of bailments edition says at p. right resulting by the common law from the contract of pledge is the right to sell the pledge where there has been a default in the pledge in complying with his engagement but a sale before default would be a conversion. such a right does not divest the general property of the pawner but still leave in him as we shall presently see a right of redemption.and at p. common law of england existing in the time of glanville seems to have required a judicial process to justify the sale or at least to destroy the right of redemption. but the law as at present established leaves an election to the pawner. he may file a bill in equity against the pawner for a foreclosure and sale or he may proceed to sell mero motu upon giving notice of his intention to the pledger.the terms of an instrument of pledge such as there is in this case giving an unqualified power of sale are inconsistent with the provisions of section of the indian contract act and therefore by virtue of section of that act must give place to the express provisions of the act see chitguppi & co. v. $$$ bom. s.c. $$$.r.the group of sections in the indian contract act dealing with bailment commence with section and it is to be observed that in the sections and the power is given to contract out of the act. in the former section the words are in the absence of any special contract and in the latter sections the expression used is in the absence of any contract to contrary. in my opinion therefore except in these sections the provisions of the act with regard to bailment are mandatory see the co -operative hindustan bank ltd. v. surendranath de cal.. it is thus clear that if on facts there is a waiver of a provision of the ppa by of the parties to the ppa then section of the contract act will operate in order to give effect to such waiver. at this juncture it is important to understand what exactly is meant by waiver. in jagad bandhu chatterjee v. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc this court held in india the general principle with regard to waiver of contractual obligation is to be found in section of the indian contract act. under that section it is open to a promise to dispense with or remit wholly or in part the performance of the promise made to him or he can accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. under the indian law neither consideration nor an agreement would be necessary to constitute waiver. this court has already laid down in waman $$$ v. ratilal bhagwandas & co. $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ supp scr that waiver is the abandonment of a right which normally everybody is at liberty to waive. a waiver is nothing unless it amounts to a release. it signifies nothing more than an intention not to insist upon the right. it is well -known that in the law of pre -emption the general principle which can be said to have been uniformly adopted by the indian courts is that acquiescence in the sale by any positive act amounting to relinquishment of a pre -emptive right has the effect of the forfeiture of such a right. so far as the law of pre -emption is concerned the principle of waiver is based mainly on $$$. the contention that the waiver of the appellant 's right under section of the bengal tenancy act must be founded on contract or agreement can not be acceded to and must be rejected. para. in p. $$$ v. p. $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc this court held $$$ is an intentional relinquishment of a known right or advantage benefit claim or privilege which except for such waiver the party would have enjoyed. $$$ can also be a voluntary surrender of a right. the doctrine of waiver has been applied in cases where landlords claimed forfeiture of lease or tenancy because of breach of some condition in the contract of tenancy. the doctrine which the courts of law will recognise is a rule of judicial policy that a person will not be allowed to take inconsistent position to gain advantage through the aid of courts. $$$ sometimes partakes of the nature of an election. $$$ is consensual in nature. it implies a meeting of the minds. it is a matter of mutual intention. the doctrine does not depend on misrepresentation. $$$ actually requires parties party waiving and another receiving the benefit of waiver. there can be waiver so intended by party and so understood by the other. the essential element of waiver is that there must be a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right. the voluntary choice is the essence of waiver. there should exist an opportunity for choice between the relinquishment and an enforcement of the right in question. it can not be held that there has been a waiver of valuable rights where the circumstances show that what was d was involuntary. there can be no waiver of a non -existent right. similarly can not waive that which is not 's as a right at the time of waiver. some mistake or misapprehension as to some facts which constitute the underlying assumption without which parties would not have made the contract may be sufficient to justify the court in saying that there was no consent. para. $$$ being had to the aforesaid decisions it is clear that when waiver is spoken of in the realm of contract section of the indian contract act governs. but it is important to note that waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right and that therefore unless there is a clear intention to relinquish a right that is fully known to a party a party can not be said to waive it. but the matter does not end here. it is also clear that if any element of public interest is involved and a waiver takes place by of the parties to an agreement such waiver will not be given effect to if it is contrary to such public interest. this is clear from a reading of the following authorities. in lachoo mal v. $$$ $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ scc it was held the general principle is that every has a right to waive and to agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity which may be dispensed with without infringing any public right or public policy. thus the maxim which sanctions the non -observance of the statutory provision is cuilibet licet renuntiare juri pro se introducto. see maxwell on interpretation of statutes $$$.pp. and. if there is any express prohibition against contracting out of a statute in it then no question can arise of any entering into a contract which is so prohibited but where there is no such prohibition it will have to be seen whether an act is intended to have a more extensive operation as a matter of public policy. para. in $$$ v. nand kishore manu / sc/00/manu / sc/00/ scc it was held the test to determine the nature of interest namely private or public is whether the right which is renunciated is the right of party al or of the public also in the sense that the general welfare of the society is involved. if the answer is latter then it may be difficult to put estoppel as a defence. but if it is right of party al then it is capable of being abnegated either in writing or by conduct. para. in $$$ v. purna theatre manu / sc//$$$$manu / sc//$$$$ scc it was held the principle of waiver although is akin to the principle of estoppel the difference between the however is that whereas estoppel is not a cause of action it is a rule of evidence waiver is contractual and may constitute a cause of action it is an agreement between the parties and a party fully knowing of its rights has agreed not to assert a right for a consideration.a right can be waived by the party for whose benefit certain requirements or conditions had been provided for by a statute subject to the condition that no public interest is involved therein. whenever waiver is pleaded it is for the party pleading the same to show that an agreement waiving the right in consideration of some compromise came into being. statutory right however may also be waived by his conduct. para. it is thus clear that if there is any element of public interest involved the court steps in to thwart any waiver which may be contrary to such public interest. on the facts of this case it is clear that the moment electricity tariff gets affected the consumer interest comes in and public interest gets affected. this is in fact statutorily recognized by the electricity act in sections to thereof. under section the appropriate commission when it specifies terms and conditions for determination of tariff is to be guided inter alia by the safeguarding of the consumer interest and the recovery of the cost of electricity in a reasonable manner. for this purpose factors that encourage competition efficiency and good performance are also to be heeded. under section of the act the appropriate commission is to determine such tariff in accordance with the principles contained in section. the present case however is covered by section which begins with a non obstante $$$ stating that notwithstanding anything contained in section the appropriate commission shall adopt the tariff if such tariff has been determined through a transparent process of bidding in accordance with the guidelines issued by the central government. the guidelines dated.issued by the central government under section make it clear that such guidelines are framed with the following objectives in mind these guidelines have been framed under the above provisions of section of the act. the specific objectives of these guidelines are as follows: promote competitive procurement of electricity by distribution licensees; facilitate transparency and fairness in procurement processes; facilitate reduction of information asymmetries for various bidders; protect consumer interests by facilitating competitive conditions in procurement of electricity; enhance standardization and reduce ambiguity and hence time for materialization of provide flexibility to suppliers on internal operations while ensuring certainty on availability of power and tariffs for buyers.$$$.of the said guidelines reads as follows:. unless explicitly specified in these guidelines the provisions of these guidelines shall be binding on the procurer. the process to be adopted in event of any deviation proposed from these guidelines is specified later in these guidelines under para.. paragraph of the aforesaid guidelines relates to tariff structure and paragraph.in particular which relates to energy charges is as follows:.where applicable the energy charges payable during the operation of the contract shall be related on the base energy charges specified in the bid with suitable provision for escalation. in case the bidder provides firm energy charge rates for $$$$ of the contract term the same shall be permitted in the tariffs. para.then speaks of a model power purchase agreement proposed to be entered into with the seller of electricity as follows:(ii model ppa proposed to be entered into with the seller of electricity. the ppa shall include necessary details on risk allocation between parties; technical requirements on minimum load conditions; assured off take levels; force majeure clauses as per industry standards; lead times for scheduling of power; default conditions and cure thereof and payment security proposed to be offered by the procurer. paragraph.then goes on to state deviation from process defined in the guidelines.in case there is any deviation from these guidelines the same shall be with the prior approval of the appropriate commission. the appropriate commission shall decide on the modifications to the bid documents within a reasonable time not exceeding days. a perusal of the cerc tariff adoption order in the present case dated.makes it clear that the tariff is adopted by the commission only because the competitive bidding process which has been undertaken is in accordance with the guidelines so issued. all this would make it clear that even if a waiver is claimed of some of the provisions of the ppa such waiver if it affects tariffs that are ultimately payable by the consumer would necessarily affect public interest and would have to pass muster of the commission under sections to of the electricity act. this is for the reason that what is adopted by the commission under section is only a tariff obtained by competitive bidding in conformity with guidelines issued. if at any subsequent point of time such tariff is increased which increase is outside the corners of the ppa even in cases covered by section the legislative intent and the language of sections and make it clear that the commission al can accept such amended tariff as it would impact consumer interest and therefore public interest. but on the facts of these cases it is argued by learned counsel for sasan that in point of fact the tariff laid down in schedule of the ppa has not been sought to be changed. all that has happened is that as a result of cod being declared on.the very tariff laid down in schedule becomes applicable but for year being treated as day and year commencing from.. counsel for sasan may be right in saying this but the substance of the matter is that a consumer would have to pay substantially more by way of tariff under the ppa if year is gobbled up in day as year 's tariff is paisa more than year and year 's tariff is substantially more than year. in short instead of getting years or part thereof exceeding year at a substantially lower tariff the consumer now gets only year and day at the lower tariff rates. this may also by itself not lead to the parties having to go to the commission as this is envisaged by the ppa. but it is clear that if a waiver is to be accepted on the facts of this case it would clearly impact the public interest in that consumers would have to pay substantially more for electricity consumed by them. this being the case on facts it may not be necessary to go to the commission as had sasan in fact met the parameters of schedule on $$$$ then as per schedule year would in fact have been only for day. however any waiver of the requirement of schedule would definitely impact the generation of electricity at the mandated percentage of contracted capacity as also the amounts payable by consumers and would therefore affect the public interest. this being the case this is not a case covered by the judgments cited on behalf of sasan in particular the judgment of this court in commissir of customs bombay v. virgo steels bombay manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc in which it has been held that even the mandatory requirement of a statute can be waived by the party concerned provided it is intended only for his benefit. this case would fall within the parameters of the other judgments referred to above and would therefore be governed by judgments which state that any waiver of the requirements of article.and schedule would ultimately impact consumer interest and therefore the public interest. such waiver therefore can not be allowed to pass muster on the facts of the present case. since the result of this case also depends upon the correct reading of article read with schedule of the ppa and whether there has been waiver in fact in the sense of being the intentional relinquishment of a known right by the procurers or on their behalf it is necessary to advert to the scheme of article the independent engineer 's certificate and various meetings emails and letters exchanged between the parties. article deals with synchronization commissioning and commercial operations. in the step to be taken by the seller the unit producing electricity has to be synchronized to the grid system. it is only after synchronization takes place that the unit is to be commissid. what is important is that at the commissioning stage the parameters mentid in schedule are to be met. the most important parameter mentid in schedule when the performance test is to be taken for the purpose of commissioning is that a unit shall be deemed to have passed such test only if it operates continuously for consecutive hours at or about % of its contracted capacity as existing on the effective date and within the electrical system limits and functional specifications. further as a part of the performance test the seller must demonstrate that the unit meets functional specifications for ramping rate separately mentid in schedule of the ppa. it is only when such test is passed that a unit can be said to be commissid under the ppa. this then is to be certified by the independent engineer jointly appointed by the parties under article.in the form of a final test certificate which states that the commission tests have been carried in accordance with schedule and are acceptable to him and the result of the performance test shows that the unit 's tested capacity is not less than % of the contracted demand as existing on the effective date. if the schedule parameters are not met it is incumbent on the independent engineer to then state reasons for the non -issuance of the final test certificate. once this is d under article.the seller may retake the relevant test within a reasonable period after the end of the previous test so as to comply with the basic requirements of schedule. it is only after this that a unit can be said to be a commissid unit as defined which means that it is a unit in respect of which cod has occurred. cod or commercial operation date is also separately defined as meaning in relation to a unit the date day after the date when each of the procurers receives a final test certificate of the independent engineer as per article.. it is thus clear that the scheme of article is that a unit can not be said to have a commercial operation date unless and until it is synchronized with the grid and commissid after meeting the parameters mentid in schedule of the ppa. article.refers to performance tests of a unit during the period of the ppa. if under article.after cod has been achieved in a unit an increased tested capacity over and above that provided in.b is achieved in a subsequent performance test certain consequences follow. equally if after cod has been obtained in a unit and the most recent performance test mentid during the working of the ppa has been conducted and it is found that in such test a figure less than contracted capacity is achieved the unit shall be de -rated with certain consequences which are mentid in article.read with article.. the scheme of article therefore read as a whole appears to be that cod can not be achieved until the parameters mentid in schedule are achieved and there is a final test certificate to that effect. the subsequent clauses article.and article.only kick in after cod is obtained in a unit leading to either increased capacity or to de -rated capacity with consequences which follow under the ppa. the meetings emails and letters between the parties have now to be examined. the important meeting that is necessary for us to advert to is the meeting of.. the meeting was chaired by the managing director of the lead procurer i. m.p. power management company limited. it was attended by all the other procurers and officials of sasan. what is emphasized on behalf of sasan is that the revised cod of the sasan units was accepted by all the procurers under article.of the ppa to be - unit by.. the procurers asked sasan for the estimated date for synchronization and cod of the unit. sasan indicated that synchronization is expected in the week of march and the cod before.. what is important about this meeting is that the procurers were no doubt interested in getting electricity from sasan as soon as possible but obviously only in accordance with article.read with the schedule. this would only mean that the meeting would disclose that the anxiety of the procurers to get electricity at cheap rates would be in accordance with the ppa and not against it. in other words if a final test certificate had been given to the effect that % of contracted capacity could have been delivered by $$$ no. on or before.the procurers were anxious to avail of it and not otherwise. it is unnecessary for us to burden this judgment with the emails that passed between sasan and wrldc between.and.. it is enough for us to state that sasan contends that it was ready to deliver at % of the contracted demand but for wrldc and wrldc states that sasan was never obstructed by wrldc and in fact was not capable of delivering electricity at % of the contracted demand at the relevant time. wrldc appears to be correct in this for the simple reason that if we see the performance of sasan for the period st april to th $$$$ it is clear that various tests were undertaken but % of contract capacity for a continuous period of hours had only been achieved in $$$$ even according to sasan. in any event the performance test certificate issued on.leaves much to be desired. since the commission has castigated this certificate and the appellate tribunal has absolved the independent $$$ completely it is necessary to set out this certificate in full.lahmeyer international india $$$. ltd.corporate office & correspondence address intec house institutional area sector $$$$ national capital region india)certificate of independent engineer ie)test certificate of $$$ for the commercial operation declaration of the first $$$ $$$- of mw of sasan ultra mega power project mw)this certificate is issued by ie with reference to article.of ppa

it is certified that:. the $$$ was synchronized with the grid at.hrs on th march after receiving the permission of wrldc. the $$$ spl had submitted the power injection schedule to wrldc at.hours on th march for raising the load gradually to % of the contracted capacity of.mw(ex bus by hrs. on th march for demonstrating continuous operation at that load for continuous consecutive hours. however wrldc did not permit the $$$ to operate the $$$ beyond mw bus till of th march due to the following reasons the demand in the grid was low due to the holiday on account of holi festival.all the $$$s in the grid were operating at their technical minimum capacity. the $$$ was continuously keeping in touch with wrldc till.hours on th march for seeking permission to raise the load. at.hrs on th march wrldc permitted the seller to raise the load. accordingly $$$ raised the load to around mw bus. at.hours on 0th march wrldc asked the seller to submit its revised power injection schedule for raising the load. at this point of time the $$$ had already completed continuous operation of consecutive hours at a low load of about mw -bus and another consecutive hours immediately thereafter at mw. $$$ informed wrldc at.hrs that it would increase the load from.hours to reach full load. as such in line with wrldc instructions and grid conditions. $$$ maintained load of around mw bus for around hours and maintained load of around mw bus for remaining hours as per wrldc instructions and grid conditions. the $$$ has been carried out in accordance with schedule of ppa and the results of the $$$ are acceptable to ie. the results of the $$$ show that the $$$ 's tested capacity is not less than.mw bus the maximum permitted load by wrldc for injection into the grid. during the above stated period of continuous consecutive hours the performance of the unit was found to conform to the electrical limits of the functional specifications in accordance with schedule of ppa.the salient details of the $$$ are as follows due to load restriction by wrldc. since the $$$ was operating below % of the rated load due to grid restriction the $$$ could not be demonstrate the ramping rate above % of the rated load in accordance with schedule of ppa. however as per the certificate provided by original equipment manufacturer of boiler turbine & generator minimum ramp up and ramp down rate of % of contracted capacity per minute can be achieved. the unit could not be tested for the following parameters of supercritical technology at the steam turbine inlet as defined in ppa due to grid restriction.main steam pressure kg / cm abs)ii main steam temperature deg c.reheat temperature deg c.however the unit was found to operate with the following parameters at the steam turbine inlet during hour operation from to on th march.main steam pressure.$$$ / cm abs)ii main steam temperature.deg. c.reheat temperature.deg c. all the systems and equipment have been commissid and are operational with coal mills which were taken into service. the balance mills could not be taken into service due to the restrictions imposed by the grid. the furnace was found to operate stably even at a low load of.mw -bus and the parameters of turbine shaft vibrations generator slot temperature and generator core temperature were found to be well within the equipment limits recommended by oem. in view of the above the unit- is certified to have achieved commercial operation with a tested capacity of.mw bus since:(a $$$ was carried out in accordance with article and schedule of the ppa.b results of the test show that unit- has met functional specifications stipulated in schedule of the ppa.for lahmeyer international s(india)sd/-r.k. soniproject managerdated 0th march. it will be seen from this certificate that the tested capacity of the unit was found to be only.mw as against % of mw i. mw. it was also stated that since the unit was operating below % of the rated load due to grid restriction the unit could not demonstrate ramping rate above % of rated load in accordance with the schedule of the ppa. paragraph of the certificate leaves much to be desired. obviously if the tested capacity is.mw as against the required % i. mw the test could not have been carried out in accordance with article read with schedule and that despite the fact that ramping up and down could not be achieved functional specifications stipulated in schedule of the ppa were said to have been met. we are constrained therefore to agree with cerc which in its order dated.has castigated this certificate. what article.requires is and foremost a final test certificate of the independent $$$. the certificate dated.given by the independent $$$ is not a final test certificate. indeed it is only in $$$$ that a final test certificate was given in accordance with article.of the ppa by the very same independent engineer. obviously the commissioning tests could not have been carried out in accordance with schedule which requires in $$$.i that the seller shall perform in respect of each unit a performance test by which such unit shall be deemed to have passed only if it operates continuously for consecutive hours at or above % of its contracted capacity as existing on the effective date. also part of the same schedule requires that as a part of the performance test the seller shall demonstrate that the unit meets the functional specifications for ramping rate as mentid in schedule which was again conspicuous by its absence. according to the independent $$$.. the unit is certified to have achieved commercial operation with a tested capacity.mw after carrying out the commissioning test in accordance with article and schedule of the ppa. in the certificate dated.he has stated that on witnessing the performance test from.to.the tested capacity of the unit is.mw. however it is clearly recorded that unit was operated beyond mw only from the morning of.. in the chart on the performance test the independent $$$ has noted that.mw is operated only from.a. on.. under article read with schedule.. unit shall be deemed to have passed if it operates continuously for consecutive hours at or above % of its contracted capacity as existing on the effective date.even according to the independent $$$.mw was injected only at.a. on.. such a tested capacity of.mw for hours continuously could therefore have been certified only at.a. on.. if that be so the commercial operation date would have been only day after the date when the test certificate of the independent $$$ has been received by the procurers. for this reason also the test certificate is by no means in accordance with article.of the ppa read with schedule thereof. it is now important to examine the correspondence between the parties in order to ascertain whether the appellate tribunal is correct in stating that waiver had in fact taken place. at this stage it is important to advert to an email dated.sent by the lead procurer to sasan. this email categorically states as follows with reference to the letter no. geie 0/ -dt. 0th march relating to the test certificate of the independent $$$ towards the $$$ for declaration of cod of unit- of mw of umpp sasan project. it is to inform that as per $$$.a and of the ppa $$$ should have been carried out in accordance with schedule of ppa and that the result of the test should not have been less than percent of its contracted capacity. the test result is not as per the aforesaid $$$ and therefore is not acceptable to us. if the $$$ is agreeable to consider the performance test under $$$.for a de -rated capacity of.mw the same could be agreed by us. however sasan relies heavily upon an email sent on.by the lead procurer to sasan. this email reads as follows tothe chief executive officerm / s. sasan power ltd.dhirubhai ambani knowledge city, block 2nd floor north wing thane belapur road koparkhairane $$$ maharashtra independent $$$ 's letter dated 0th march independent $$$ 's letter dated 0th march sir please refer the independent $$$ 's letter dated 0th march pertaining to test certificate of $$$ for the commercial operation declaration of the first unit unit- of mw of sasan ultra mega power project mw and e -mail dated.of.am sent by western region load despatch centre regarding scheduling of power from unit no. of sasan umpp. as lead procurer the $$$ as certified by the independent $$$ for a capacity of.mw -bus is acceptable to us under clause.of the ppa. you may kindly go for $$$ under notice to us for increasing the capacity beyond certification by the independent engineer in accordance with clause.of the ppa.as provided in article.of the ppa in the period between this performance test and the next performance test the unit 's contracted capacity and available capacity would be considered as.mw -bus and its availability factor shall be calculated by reference to.mw. the charges payable for power shall be as laid down in article.of the ppa. in case the unit is in position to produce beyond.mw the additional quantity would be scheduled in favour of the procurers under proviso to article.of the ppa until the next $$$ is conducted under article..thanking you yours faithfully sd/-executive director ipc)2. the emails read together would show that the lead procurer made it clear that declaration of cod of unit is not accepted by them as the test was not performed as per article.. however in its anxiety to procure electricity what was stated in the email was that the capacity of.mw was acceptable only under article.of the ppa meaning thereby that this ought to be treated as de -rated capacity which should be paid for as provided. and any quantity produced over and above.mw would be treated as infirm power under article.proviso and paid for as such. $$$ argued that the moment article.of the ppa is attracted this would necessarily mean that the appellants have waived the requirement of % of the contracted capacity as existing on the effective date mentid in article.. according to him this would mean that scheduled power would have to be supplied which in turn can only be d if there is waiver of the aforesaid requirement. it is difficult to agree. the case of the appellants has throughout been starting from 2th april onwards that it has never consented to schedule of the ppa and article.parameters being lowered. it is true that article.would not apply for the reason that it would come into effect only after the last recent performance test mentid in article.has been conducted. and for article.to apply a performance test must indicate that from a unit 's cod an increased tested capacity over and above that provided in article.must occur. admittedly on facts this has not happened. what is important to note therefore is that the appellants desperately wanted power at a cheaper rate and were willing to go to any extent to get such power including invoking clause.which would not apply and stating that anything over and above.mw ought to be treated as infirm power. it is clear under the regulations however that infirm power can never be supplied to the appellants themselves but can only be supplied to the grid. this being the case the question that is still posed is whether the emails read together would amount to a waiver of the right mentid in clause.. $$$ is as has been pointed out above an intentional relinquishment of a known right. $$$ must be spelled out with crystal clarity for there must be a clear intention to give up a known right. there is no such clear intention that can be spelled out on a reading of the emails. all that can be spelled out is that the email of.categorically states that the test result is not as per article.and is not acceptable. the last sentence of this very email then refers to clause.and to a de -rated capacity of.mw. $$$ the email of 2nd april expands on the aforesaid last sentence of the earlier email by referring to article.and article proviso. this is akin to a without prejudice acceptance of de -rated power being a non -acceptance of the test certificate dated.coupled with a desperate attempt to somehow get whatever power is available. but this does not amount to a clear and unequivocal intention to relinquish a known right. it is not necessary to burden this judgment with various other acceptance emails of the other discoms inasmuch as they are all in terms of the email sent by the lead procurer. $$$ has sent an email dated.in which even while accepting derated power it has accepted the same without prejudice to its rights. in contrast to the aforesaid emails the acceptance emails of bypl and brpl both reliance group companies may now be quoted dear sirfrom sasan umpp delhi has allocation of mw as per mop out of which brpl share is.out of delhi allocation. we accept the cod of unit of mw as declared by spl. $$$$ please schedule full quantum of brpl with immediate effect and confirm.regards.$$$.assistant vp brpl. srivastav as v.p. this acceptance email is in stark contrast with the acceptance email of the lead procurer in that it unequivocally accepts cod of the unit of mw as declared by sasan. it is therefore clear that on facts in this case there is no waiver and the appellate tribunal in coming to an opposite conclusion is clearly errous. interestingly enough the appellate tribunal in the impugned judgment dated.contradicts itself when it states in portion as follows we have carefully g through the ratio of the law laid down by hon'ble supreme court in $$$ and in krishan lal 's case wherein in the latter case the hon'ble supreme court cited an illustration in paragraph thereof. the words of the hon'ble supreme court are to illustrate this principle it has been stated that if the statutory condition be imposed simply for the security or the benefit of the parties to the action themselves such condition will not be considered as indispensable and either party may waive it.in the present case the requirement of achieving % of the contracted capacity for declaration of cod was not for the private benefit of the seller and procurers. the said requirement and the appointment of an independent expert to oversee the commissioning process was built into the statutory contract i. ppa itself for a specific purpose as a requirement of general policy to ensure that generators do not declare their units to be commercially available without even demonstrating the capability of such units to achieve at least % of the contracted capacity.and then goes on to state we further find that in the present case there is no question of any public interest or public policy or morals or statutory regulations being violated. the wrldc who was a $$$ before the central commission in its petition clearly and equivocally states that there are no guidelines in respect of declaration of cod of the generators who are not governed by $$$ tariff regulations and in the petition wrldc prays to the central commission for issuing regulations and guidelines in that behalf. we thus find that the appellate tribunal is wholly incorrect in accepting the case of waiver put forward by learned counsel for sasan and is equally incorrect in absolving the independent engineer for the test certificate given by him on.. we therefore set aside the appellate tribunal 's judgment and reinstate the judgment dated.of the central electricity regulatory commission. shri sibal 's last argument is that there is no substantial question of law so as to attract section of the electricity act in these appeals. we are afraid that we can not agree. substantial question of law is whether when public interest is involved waiver can at all take place of a right in favour of the generator of electricity under a ppa if the right also has an impact on consumer interest. this substantial question of law has been answered by us in the course of the judgment. we have also pointed out that the appellate tribunal 's finding that the independent engineer 's test certificate can pass muster and that there is a waiver on facts is not a possible conclusion and such finding is therefore perverse and hence set aside. that apart we have also pointed out the contradictory nature of the judgment of the appellate tribunal when it points out that the requirement of article.is not merely for the private benefit of the procurers of electricity but is as a matter of general policy and then later on in the judgment finds that no question of public interest or public policy arises in the present case. in these circumstances this plea must also be turned down. in the result the appeals are allowed but with no order as to costs.
