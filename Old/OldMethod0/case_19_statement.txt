s.n. variava j. the facts relevant for the purposes of this writ petition are as follows the state of andhra pradesh established family courts and mahila courts. the high court of andhra pradesh desired that these courts be manned by women. however in the cadre of $$$ and $$$ $$$ there were not enough women judges who could be posted in these courts. therefore the high court requested the state to create additional posts. on rd september the state government issued office memorandum no. sanctioning additional posts of $$$ and $$$ $$$. the relevant portion of the said memorandum reads as follows:"the registrar high court of andhra pradesh hyderabad has informed in his letter read above that family courts in the cadre of $$$ and sessions judge were sanctid at visakhapatnam hyderabad vijayawada kurnool $$$ and warangal in the g.o. rd read above and another family court at secunderabad was sanctid in the g.o. th read above. the registrar high court of andhra pradesh has further stated that the high court considers it necessary to post lady $$$ to preside over the family courts in the state with a view to protect and preserve that institution of marriage and to promote the welfare of the children as stipulated in rule a and of the family court act but due to non availability of women judicial officers in the cadre of $$$ the high court is unable to post lady $$$ to the family courts. the registrar has also stated that mahila courts with lady presiding officer at hyderabad vijayawada and visakhapatnam were sanctid exclusively to deal with offences against women in the g.os.  and read above. the registrar high court of andhra pradesh has finally requested that posts of $$$ and sessions judge grade -ii be sanctid in addition to the existing cadre strength exclusively to recruit the women candidates by direct recruitment for being posted to the family courts and mahila courts in the state. government after careful consideration of the matter hereby sanction in relaxation of rule of the special rules for the a.p. state higher judicial service posts of $$$ and $$$ grade -ii in addition to the existing cadre strength exclusively for women candidates to be recruited by direct recruitment. pursuant to this memorandum the high court issued an advertisement inviting applications from women candidates for appointment to the post of $$$ and sessions judge grade -ii. the advertisement specified that posts would be available for open competition posts for the $$$s post for the scheduled tribe post for $$$ group a and post for $$$ group b. pursuant to this advertisement candidates applied for the posts. the high court called candidates for a written examination. candidates participated in the written examination. the high court called candidates for oral interviews. the oral interviews were conducted on 0th and st of march. a panel of candidates was prepared. the candidates were asked for furnish further information relating to their legal practice. after receipt of the information the high court rejected name. a panel of candidates was the approved at full court meeting held on th september and again on th october. this panel consisted of candidates from the open category from $$$ and from $$$ group d. the high court then sent the names of the candidates to the state government for appointment. the state government brought to the notice of the high court certain aspects and requested the high court to consider the same and express its views. the aspects brought to the notice of the high court were as follows:". as rule of the a.p. state and subordinate service rules old or new prescribes a specific procedure either for filling of s.c. and s.t. vacancies with o.c. candidates or for de -reserving such vacancies it is for the consideration whether $$$$ vacancies int he recruitment reserved for $$$s and sts respectively can straightaway be de- reserved which is not in consonance with the said rule. as the notification inviting the applications for the post in question was issued much later to --the principles of carry forward of vacancies in respect of bcs also applies to the recruitment. the recommendation of the high court at roster points and reserved for bc.a and bc.b groups respectively required consideration in the light of rules issued in g.o.ms.no. general administration ser.dept.dated --. the high court informed that the appointments of the provisionally selected candidates shall be provisionally as family court judges under the family courts act to man family courts and mahila courts only. as the proposal for sanction and notification are for the posts of $$$ and $$$ $$$ it is for consideration whether the candidates provisionally appointed in such requirement can now be provisionally appointed designating them as family courts judges. the high court has stated that the recommended candidates to be provisionally appointed as family court judges would be recruited into higher judicial service as $$$ judges $$$ as and when vacancies in the cadre to the extent of reservation for women become available in order of their merit subject to the rule of reservation it has to be considered in view of rule of the special rules and whether they can be so adjusted as suggested in view of rule of the special rules. whether the provisionally selected candidates recruited as $$$ judges in the andhra pradesh state higher judicial service can be kept out of the service by provisional appointment to some other post and recruiting them into the posts of $$$ judges on the availability of vacancies reserved for women. the appointments to the posts of $$$ judges shall be made by the governor of the state where as under the family courts act the state government appoints persons to be judges of the family courts. hence the appropriate procedure to be adopted for making the suggested appointments may also be considered. the high court considered the aspects brought to its notice in a meeting of the full court held on st november. the high court then replied to the state government as follows:"for query no.per the rules in force the vacancies relating to $$$ and st candidates can not be straight away de -reserved. if there are no qualified candidates of $$$ and st available the said vacancies have to be carried forward for limited recruitment. therefore the high court is of the view that the vacancies reserved for $$$ and st candidates can not be dereserved.for query no. per the rules in force the vacancies relating to each category of candidates belonging $$$ group a b c and d can not be converted into other categories and they have to be carried forward for limited recruitment if the candidates belonging to each sub -group are not available. therefore the high court is of the view that the vacancies reserved for each sub group can not be filed up with the candidates of other sub groups.for query no.  advertisement for the recruitment of women candidates was made inviting applications for the posts of $$$ and $$$ $$$. the government accorded sanction of additional posts in g.o. ms. no. $$$ la&j scf department dated.. there is no provision in the special rules for a.p. state higher judicial service for eventual absorption of the candidates appointed as family court judges into the cadre of $$$ judges $$$ against the future vacancies falling with the direct recruitment quota. in this regard aspects viz.suitability test from the point of view of merit of the candidates and legality of recruitment by inviting applications exclusively from women candidates only have been considered by the high court.regarding the suitability it is noticed by the high court that the candidates who were provisionally selected have got even if % is taken as minimum marks for ocs and % for scs and $$$ for the purpose of selection as $$$ judges $$$. the recommendation through the letter cited was for appointment of the women candidates as family court judges and not as $$$ and $$$ $$$. the high court therefore is of the view that it is not conductive to the efficiency in service and the image of judiciary if the candidates who have got such lower marks are inducted into higher judicial service.regarding the legality of recruitment the high court is of the view that there are formidable legal impediments in the way of recommending the candidates for appointment as $$$ and $$$ $$$. the high court is of the further view that the spl. rules for a.p. state higher judicial service issued in exercise of powers conferred under article and the proviso to article of the constitution of india and those rules enjoin that. % of the total number of permanent posts shall be filled or reserved to be filled by direct recruitment. the government accorded sanction of posts of $$$ and $$$ $$$ in addition to the existing cadre strength exclusively for women candidates to be recruited by direct recruitment. this was purportedly done by relaxation of rule of the special rules for a.p. state higher judicial service. rule provides for method of appointment and the proportion between the recruits by transfer promotes and direct recruits from the bar. by resorting to relaxation of the said rule it is not legally permissible to earmark sanctioned posts exclusively for direct recruitment of women candidates since there is no rule in the a.p. state higher judicial service giving the power to relax any of the rules. the power to relax the rules would only be under the a.p. state and subordinate service rules. even if there is such power it is doubtful whether the basic rules of recruitment can be relaxed in view of the rulings of the supreme court in $$$ v. union of india manu / sc/00/manu / sc/00/ airsc4 and in j&k public service commission v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/04/4 . the high court is of the further view that ear -making additional posts sanctioned only to the women candidates amount to reservation in favour of women which is not legal / constitutionally permissible. even if the reservation provided under rule of the a.p. state and subordinate service rules is made applicable to a.p. state higher judicial service the reservation could be to the extent of only.for query no. 4:since there is no rule under the spl. rules for a.p. state higher judicial service to absorb the family courts judges into the higher judicial service as $$$ & $$$ $$$ as and when vacancies in the cadre to the extent of reservation for women become available the high court is of the view that they can not be absorbed in view of rule read with rule of the special rules for a.p. state higher judicial service.for query no. :according to rule of the spl. rules for a.p. state higher judicial service seniority of a person appointed to the category of $$$ and $$$ shall be determined with reference to the date from which he was continuously on duty in the category. the spl. rules do not provide to keep provisionally selected $$$ judges out of service as family court and mahila court judges and recruiting them into the posts of $$$ judges as and when vacancies for women for direct recruitment become available in order to their merit and subject to the rule of reservation. therefore the high court is of the view that the provisionally selected candidates as $$$ judges can not be kept out of that service by provisional appointment to some other post and recruiting them into the posts of $$$ judges on the availability of vacancies reserved for women.for query no. view of the above views expressed by the high court this query needs no clarification.in the light of the above views for the queries raised by the government the high court of andhra pradesh is not in favour of recommending any women candidates on provisional selection for appointment as $$$ and $$$ $$$ under the a.p. state higher judicial service in pursuance of the notification issued on the basis of the high court 's letter no.spl dated..thus the full court in its meeting held on st november was not in favour of appointing any person from the panel prepared earlier. it must be noted that the vacancies were for judges of family courts and mahila courts. these courts could be manned by $$$ and $$$ $$$. the state government had thus created posts of district and sessions judge $$$. the advertisement was also for appointment to the posts of district and sessions judge $$$. the appointments were to be not to any -cadre posts but to posts in the cadre of district and sessions judge $$$. the rules prescribed that in the cadre of district and $$$ there had to be reservations for scheduled tribes $$$ $$$ group a b c or d and women. the rules did not allow % reservation for women. by reserving all the posts for women the high court had inadvertently created a % reservation for women. further the posts advertised were open competition scheduled $$$ scheduled tribe $$$ group a and $$$ group b. yet the panel sent to the government consisted of opened competition candidates scheduled $$$ candidate and $$$ group d candidate. such a selection was entirely against the rules and against the reservation policy. the rules also required that if no sc or st candidate was available then the vacancy had to be carried forward. similarly the vacancy of $$$ group a b c and/or d could not be converted into other category. because of these difficulties the persons empanelled could not be appointed in the cadre of district & sessions judge $$$. the high court initially considered that the petitioners could be appointed in -cadre posts as family court and/or mahila court judges and then absorb them in the cadre of district and sessions judge grade ii as and when vacancy for women arose. the high court correctly realised that this could not be done. it was also noticed that the candidates provisionally selected i. the petitioners had got than those normally prescribed for such selection. it must be mentioned that in the meantime the petitioners had made representations both to the chief justice as well as to the chief minister. they received no reply. this writ petition was thus filed by the women lawyers who were selected and whose names were forwarded to the state government for appointment. the petitioners sought directions to appoint them in the cadre of district and $$$ grade ii. $$$ on 20th july another advertisement was issued calling for applications for appointment to posts of district judges. in this advertisement only post was reserved for women. the petition was thus amended and a further direction to quash the decision of the full court not to appoint as per the selection earlier made to quash the subsequent advertisement have been sought. it is settled law that no right accrues to a person merely because a person is selected and his or her name is put on a panel. the petitioners have no right to claim an appointment. even otherwise the selection was contrary to the rules in force at that time. there could not be % reservation for women. also the reservation policy had not been adhered to. the posts which are created are posts of district and sessions judges grade ii. there is no separate posts of judges of family courts and mahila courts. thus the petitioners could not be appointed as judges of family courts and mahila courts in -cadre posts even provisionally. this would amount to creation of ex -cadre posts not sanctioned by the government. no fault can be found with the high court being in favour of not appointing the petitioners. the unfortunate part is that even though family court and mahila courts have been established no appointments have been made. thus till date the family courts and mahila courts are not being manned. mr. $$$ has relied upon the case of r.s. mittal v. union of india reported in manu / sc/1009/1995manu / sc/1009/1995. in this case even though the court was of the opinion that the selection was not proper it refused to interfere. mr. nageshwar rao also relied on the case of munna $$$ v. union of india reported in manu / sc/2607/2000manu / sc/2607/2000. in this case the court directed appointment of the selected candidate in spite of the fact that she had no right to the appointment. both these cases are based on the peculiar facts of those cases. as the posts were lying vacant for such a long period of time initially it was suggested that if the $$$ filed an undertaking before this court that they are willing to be appointed in -cadre posts of judges of the family court and/or mahial court and that they will not claim any right to be subsequently absorbed in the cadre of district and sessions judges grade ii then the court could consider directing the state government to appoint these petitioners. of these petitioners have filed undertakings before this court. however on a proper consideration of the matter we are of the view that this court can not direct the state government to appoint these petitioners. if such a direction were to be given this court would be crating -cadre posts and making appointments contrary to rules. thus it is not possible for this court to accede to the request of mr. nageshwar rao to appoint petitioners on the -cadre posts as judges of family courts and mahila courts. writ petition is thus dismissed. there will be no order as to costs.
