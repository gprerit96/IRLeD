r.p. $$$ j. aggrieved by the determination of $$$$ valuation made in terms of section of the calcutta municipal corporation act hereinafter called the act"),the appellant -owner of a storeyed building admittedly used for commercial purposes filed an appeal before the municipal assessment tribunal who vide its order dated $$$$ allowed the appeal and fixed the $$$$ value on the basis of rent actually received by the appellant -owner. feeling aggrieved the respondent -corporation approached the high court under $$$ of the constitution of india who vide the order impugned in this appeal set aside the order of the tribunal and directed it to hear the appeals on merits keeping in mind that total amount paid by the sub -ants to the ant of the appellant should also be taken into consideration in assessing the $$$$ valuation. it is not disputed that the property in question was leased out by the appellants to their ant named $$$ at a rental of rs. $$$$ vide a duly executed lease deed annexure p-. there is also no dispute that the building is a storeyed building and issued for commercial purposes. the respondent -corporation carried out the general revision of the $$$$ valuation of the premises effective from th quarter of -and also for the period from th quarter of -. proposed valuation was communicated to the owners vide notices issued under the act directing them to atd the hearing before the hearing officer of the corporation on the date specified in the notice. the appellant submitted objections to the notices and objected to the same challenging the proposed valuation and the basis thereof. the hearing officer vide his orders dated.fixed $$$$ valuation from th quarter of -at rs. and from th quarter of -at rs. the $$$$ valuation assessment was made under section of the act by taking into consideration the rent paid by the sub -ants. the municipal assessment tribunal accepted the appeal of the owners by relying upon the judgment of this court in corporation of calcutta v. life insurance corporation of india $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0. not satisfied with the judgment of the tribunal municipal corporation moved the high court byway of a petition under article of the constitution of india which was allowed by setting aside the order of the tribunal vide judgment impugned in this appeal. the high court held that the aforesaid decision of this court had no application to an assessment made under section of the act which was found to be materially different from section of the calcutta municipal act under which the assessment had been made in life insurance corporation 's case supra. the high court further held that under act the $$$$ valuation in no case could exceed the standard rent fixed by the west bengal premises $$$ control(temporary provision act but under the act which had a non -obstante clause the $$$$ valuation can be fixed notwithstanding anything contained in the west bengal tenancy act or any other law for the time being inforce. it has been further held that under the act the consolidated rate is primarily leviable if the land and building is let upon lessor and if the land and building is sub -let still upon the superior lessor under section of the act and for that reason section of the act has conferred a right upon the lessor lessee or the sub- lessee to recover the excess amount from their respective ants for the excess payable by them due to creation of ancy or sub -ancy. it was further held that the municipal corporation is in no way bound by the fixation of standard rent of fair rent by the $$$ $$$ and the rent realised by a ant from the sub -ant or by a sub -ant from his ant is required to be taken into consideration and such amount to be treated as gross rent of the land or building for the purposes of section of the act. finding that the appellate tribunal had acted illegally and with material irregularity in holding that in assessing $$$$ valuation of the building the amount realised from the sub -ants can not be taken into consideration the matter was remanded to the tribunal to hear the appeal afresh on merits and decide the same in the light of the observations made by the high court. not satisfied with the judgment of the high court the owners of the building have preferred this appeal. when this appeal was listed in the court on 0th november the judges constituting the bench felt that following observations of this court in the case of lic required reconsideration:"but under the act the quantum of the consolidated rate depends upon the $$$$ values of land or building on the gross rent for which the land or building might reasonably be expected to let and not the gross rent at which the subordinate interest of a ant may be expected to sublet. the bench directed the registry to place the matter before the hon'ble chief justice for listing this matter before a bench of judges. in such circumstances this appeal has come before us. it is conded on behalf of the appellant that the order passed by the municipal assessment tribunal was strictly according to law and did not suffer from any infirmity with which the high court could have interfered. it is submitted that while assessing the valuation of the property the amount taken by the ant from a sub -ant can not be taken into consideration in view of the judgment of this court in lic 's case supra. according to the appellant the $$$$ value of the land and building has to be deemed to be gross $$$$ rent including service charges as contemplated under section of the act which does not include the rent received by a ant from the sub -ant. according to the appellant $$$$ value has to be determined on the basis of the actual rent received by the owner unless it is established that such rent is not bonafide paid and that the same is shown fraudulently only for the purposes of depriving the authorities from assessing the $$$$ rental value. it is argued on behalf of the appellant that despite the changes made in the act the law laid down in $$$ 's case is still valid for the purpose of determining the gross $$$$ rent of a building under the calcutta municipal corporation act. as in the present case the assessment made by the tribunal proceeds on the basis of the actual rent received by the appellant and in the absence of any allegations of extraneous circumstances the order of the tribunal has to be upheld by setting aside the impugned judgment. it is also stated that in the present case there is no difference between the standard rent and the actual rent realized by the landlord from the ant because of application of section and section of the west bengal premises tenancy act. the issue as to whether the standard rent is the upper limit of the reasonable rent does not fall for decision under the circumstances of the present case. it is conded on behalf of the respondent- corporation that the high court has correctly interpreted section of act which is in accordance with the various judgments of this court. it is submitted that in the corporation of calcutta v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ this court had divided the municipal laws into district groups. such group referred to municipal laws of certain states which did not expressly exclude application of $$$ restriction acts in the matter of determination of $$$$ value of a building for the purposes of levying property taxes and the other group of such municipal laws which expressly exclude application of $$$ restriction acts in the matter of such determination. it is submitted that unlike calcutta municipal act and calcutta municipal act the new act contains specific provision in section providing a non obstante clause specifically excluding the operation and effect of the west bengal premises tenancy act and any such other law in force which would fall in the group of cases as referred to in padma debi 's case supra. to appreciate the rival contions of the parties it is necessary to make reference to some statutory provisions relevant for the purposes of resolving the controversy. the act was enacted to amend and consolidate the law relating to the municipal affairs of calcutta. $$$ deals with the power of taxation at consolidated rates. section authorises the corporation to levy certain taxes enumerated therein. section dealing with the determination of $$$$ valuation of the property within the municipal corporation provides:". determination of $$$$ valuation -)notwithstanding anything contained in the west bengal premises tenancy act or in any other law

rounded off to the nearest rupees.section deals with the revision of assessment and section provides for settlement of returns and inspection of lands and buildings for the purposes of assessment. section provides that subject to provisions of section or section any objection to the $$$$ value of the land and building as entered in the assessment list shall be made by the owner or the person liable to pay the consolidated rate in writing to the municipal commissir before the date fixed in the notice under section or section and shall state in what respect the $$$$ value is disputed. section deals with the hearing of objections and section provides an appeal before the municipal assessment tribunal. section catalogues the incidence of consolidated rate on lands and buildings and provides:"( the consolidated rate on lands and buildings shall be primarily leviable if the land or building is let upon the lessor;(b if the land or building is sublet upon the superior lessor;(c if the land and building is unlet upon the person in whom the right to let such land or building vests.the consolidated rate on any land or building which is the property of the corporation and the

municipal act dealt with the assessment of lands and buildings to the consolidated rate. sub -section( of section provided:"8 for the purposes of assessment to the consolidated rate the $$$$ value of any land or building shall be deemed to be the gross $$$$ rent at which the land or building might at the time of assessment be reasonably expected to let from $$$$ to $$$$ less in the case of a

building the rent of which has been fixed under the provisions of west bengal premises $$$ control(temporary provisions act or the west bengal premises tenancy act the $$$$ value thereof shall not

contained in the west bengal premises tenancy act or any other law for the time being in force appearing in section of act were non existent in section of act and section of act. in support of their view points learned counsel for the parties have relied upon various judgments of this court reported in sm. padma debi 's case supra lic 's case supra guntur municipal council v. $$$ ratepayers ' association $$$ / sc/04/0$$$ / sc/04/0 municipal corporation indore and ors. v. ratnaprabha and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ ]scr0 diwan $$$ and ors. v. new delhi municipal committee and ors. $$$ /

india and ors. $$$ / sc/0482/8$$$ / sc/0482/8. in padma debi 's case supra this court dealt with the law relating to $$$$ valuation under section of bengal act no. of and held that the words gross $$$$ rent at which the land or building might at the time of assessment reasonably be expected to let from $$$$ to $$$$ implies that the rent which the landlord might realise if the house was let is the basis for fixing the $$$$ value of the building. the criterion was the rent realisable by the landlord and not the value of the holding in the hands of the tenant. the value of the property to the owner is the standard rent in making the assessment. the word reasonably appearing in the section was held to be not capable of precise definition as in ultimate analysis the same was the question of fact. whether a particular act was reasonable or not depended upon the circumstances in a given case. a bargain between a willing lessor and willing lessee uninfluenced by any extraneous circumstances can afford a guiding test of reasonableness. the phrase at the time of assessment was held to mean the assessment commenced with the making of the valuation under section of the act and ended with the determination of the objection under section thereof. as in that case the $$$ control act of was found to be in existence before determination of the assessment the corporation was held to have no power to fix the $$$$ value of the premises higher than the standard rent. in lic 's case supra this court dealt with section of the calcutta municipal corporation act for the purposes of determination of $$$$ value of the premises. the facts of that case were that m / s. a. firpo ltd. were the tenants of the building belonging to asiatic assurance company ltd. under a lease at a $$$$ rent of rs. which was increased by mutual agreement to rs. $$$$. m / s. firpo ltd.the lessee had sub -let a major part of the premises to different tenants and the aggregate rent received from the sub -tenants amounted to rs. the corporation assessed the $$$$ value of the premises at rs. for $$$$s. the objection raised by the owner against the determination of the $$$$ value was rejected by the special officer of the corporation and in appeal filed by the lic which had statutorily acquired the right of the owner of the building the court of small causes assessed rs. as the $$$$ value. the said order was confirmed in appeal to the high court under section 83(3)of the calcutta municipal corporation act. in appeal filed in this court the corporation claimed that in determining the $$$$ value of the premises the assessing authority was entitled to take into consideration the rental received by m / s. a. firpo ltd. from its sub -tenant. reliance was placed upon padma debi 's case. this court approved the judgment in padma debi 's case but finding that as the standard rent stood determined by the definition in section of the west bengal premises $$$ control temporary provisions act held that the high court was right in assessing the $$$$ value on the basis of the standard rent as statutorily determined. it was further held that under the act the quantum of consolidated rate depends upon the value of the land or building or the gross rent for which the land or building might reasonably be expected to let and not the gross rent at which the subordinate interest of a tenant may be expected to sub -let. in determining the assessment of $$$$ value the assessing authority is not concerned with the rent which the tenant may receive from his sub -tenant. it is the gross rent which the owner may realise by letting the land or building under a bargain uninfluenced by extraneous considerations which determines the $$$$ value. in guntur town rate payers ' association 's case supra)it was held that the test for determining the rent at which the building may reasonably be expected to be let is essentially what rent premises can lawfully fetch if let out to a hypothetical tenant. the municipality is not free to assess any arbitrary $$$$ value and has to look to and is bound by the fair or the standard rent which would be payable for a particular premises under the $$$ control act in force during $$$$. such findings were returned on the basis of the judgment of this court in padma debi 's case. in smt. ratnaprabha 's case supra this court for the time considered the effect of non obstante clause appearing in madhya pradesh municipal corporation act for determining the gross $$$$ rent for which the building might reasonably be expected to be let. clause of section of the said act provided:"(b the $$$$ value of any building shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be deemed to be the gross $$$$ rent at which such building together with its appurtenances and any furniture that may be let for use or enjoyment therewith might reasonably at the time of assessment be expected to be let from $$$$ to $$$$ less an allowance of per cent for the cost of repairs and for all other expenses necessary to maintain the building in a state to command such gross $$$$ rent. interpreting the section the court held:"as has been stated clause of section of the act provides that the $$$$ value of any building shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be deemed to be the gross $$$$ rent for which the building might reasonably at the time of the assessment be expected to be let from $$$$ to $$$$. while therefore the requirement of the law is that the reasonable letting value should determine the $$$$ value of the building it has also been specifically provided that this would be so notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force. it appears to us that it would be a proper interpretation of the provisions of clause of section of the act to hold that in a case where the standard rent of a building has been fixed under section of the madhya pradesh accommodation contract act and there is nothing to show that there has been fraud or collusion that would be its reasonable letting value but where this is not so and the building has never been let out and is being used in a manner where the question of fixing its standard rent does not arise it would be permissible to fix its reasonable rent without regard to the provisions of the madhya pradesh accommodation control act. this view will in our opinion give proper effect to the non -obstante clause in clause b)with due regard to its other provision that the letting value should be reasonable. after referring to padma devi 's case lic 's case and guntur town rate payer 's case supra it was held in that case that the high court had not properly appreciated the difference between the wording of section of the calcutta municipal corporation act and section of the madhya pradesh municipal corporation act and thus committed an error in thinking that the case was virtually similar to padma debi 's case. in diwan daulat rai 's case supra this court held that the facts of the case were covered by the decisions of this court in lic 's case and guntur town rate payer 's case supra.the landlord can not reasonably expect to get more rent than the standard rent payable in accordance with the principles laid down in the $$$ control act. in a case where the standard rent of the building has not been fixed by the $$$ the assessing authority has to arrive at its own figures of standard rent by applying the principles laid down in the $$$ act. such a task has to be performed by the assessing authority as a part of process of assessment and in doing do it does not usurp the functions of the $$$ $$$ because it does not fix the standard rent which would be binding between the landlord and tenant but merely arrives at an estimate of standard rent for the purposes of determining the $$$$ value of the building. the court referred to section of the delhi $$$ control act which defines the standard rent. sub -section section of the delhi $$$ control act provided that no tenant shall notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary be liable to pay to his landlord for the occupation of any premises any amount in excess of the standard rent of the premises and sub -section of section declares that subject to provisions of sub -section( any agreement for the payment of rent in excess of the standard rent shall be construed as if it were an agreement for the payment of the standard rent only. section. sub -section enacted a prohibition injuncting that no person shall claim or receive any rent in excess of the standard rent notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary. section proceeded to set out different formulae for determination of standard rent in different classes of cases. section sub -section provided that the controller shall on an application made to him either by the landlord or by the tenant fix in respect of any premises the standard rent referred to in section and sub -section of section laid down that in fixing the standard rent of any premises the $$$ shall fix an amount which appears to him to be reasonable having regard to the provisions of section and the circumstances of the case. it appears that in this case the court did not directly deal with the effect of a non -obstante clause in the taxing municipal law. the case was found to be nearer to the law settled in lic 's case and guntur town rate payee 's case supra. dealing with the case for the determination of the $$$$ value where no standard rent has been fixed the court observed:"the problem can also be looked at from a slightly different angle. when the $$$ control legislation provides for fixation of standard rent which al and nothing more than which the tenant shall be liable to pay to the landlord it does so because it considers the measure of the standard rent prescribed by it to be reasonable. it lays down the norm of reasonableness in regard to the rent payable by the tenant to the landlord. any rent which exceeds this norm of reasonableness is regarded by the legislature as unreasonable or excessive. when the legislature has laid down this standard of reasonableness would it be right for the court to say that the landlord may reasonably expect to receive rent exceeding the measure provided by this standard would it be reasonable on the part of the landlord to expect to receive any rent in excess of the standard or norm of reasonableness laid down by the legislature and would such expectation be countenanced by the court as reasonable the legislature obviously regards recovery of rent in excess of the standard rent as exploitative of the tenant and would it be proper for the court to say that it would be reasonable on the part of the landlord to recover such exploitative rent from the tenant we are therefore of the view that even if the standard rent has not been fixed by the $$$ the landlord can not reasonably expect to receive from a hypothetical tenant anything more than the standard rent determinable under the act and this would be so equally whether the building has been let out to a tenant who has lost his right to apply for fixation of the standard rent or the building is self -occupied by the owner. the assessing authority would in either case have to arrive at its own figure of the standard rent by applying principles laid down in the delhi $$$ control act for determination of standard rent and determine the $$$$ value of the building on the basis of such figure of standard rent. in balbir singh 's case supra the court dealt with different categories of properties namely where the properties are self -occupied that is occupied by the owners where the properties are partly self- occupied and partly tenanted where the land on which the property is constructed is leasehold land with a restriction that the leasehold interest shall not be transferable without the approval of the lessor and where the property has been constructed in stages and to provide a criteria how rate able value can be determined in respect of those categories of properties. relying upon dewan dault raj kapoor 's case it was held that criteria for determining the rate able value of building is the $$$$ rent which the owner might reasonably expect to get from a hypothetical tenant if the building were to let from $$$$ to $$$$ less certain deductions. what is reasonable is a question of fact which depended on the fact and circumstances of a given situation. ordinarily a bargain between a willing lessor and a willing lessee uninfluenced by any extraneous circumstances may afford a guiding test of reasonableness and in normal circumstances the actual rent payable by a tenant to the landlord would afford reliable evidence of what the landlord may reasonably expect to get from the hypothetical tenant unless the rent is inflated or depressed by reason of extraneous considerations such as relationship expectation of some other benefit etc. but in case of a building subject to $$$ control legislation this approximation between may and often does get displaced because under $$$ control legislation the landlord can not claim to recover from the tenant anything more than the standard rent and his reasonable expectation must therefore be limited to the measure of the standard rent lawfully recoverable by him. there was no dispute that the area where the property sought to be taxed was situated the provisions of $$$ restriction acts were applicable and there was non obstante clause in the municipal law under which the $$$$ value had been assessed. in $$$ kashinath jituri 's case supra this court observed..we feel compelled to express our doubts as to the soundness and continuing relevance of the view taken by this court in several earlier decisions that the property tax must be determined on the basis of fair rent al regardless of the actual rent received. fair rent very often means the rent prevailing prior to with some minor modifications and additions. property tax is the main source of revenue to the municipalities and municipal corporations. to compel these local bodies to levy and collect the property tax on the basis of fair rent al while asking them at the same time to perform all their obligatory and discretionary functions prescribed by the statute may be to ask for the impossible. the cost of maintaining and laying roads drains and other amenities the salaries of staff and wages of employees -in short all types of expenditure have g up steeply over the least more than $$$$s. in such a situation insistence upon levy of property tax on the basis of fair rent al -disregarding the actual rent received- is neither justified nor practicable. n of the enactments says so expressly. the said principle has been evolved by courts by a process of interpretation.probably a time has come when the said principle may have to be reviewed. in indian oil corporation 's case supra this court approved the view taken in ratnaprabha 's case and in the interest of public good declined to reconsider the aforesaid decision. it was observed that the decision of this court in ratnaprabha 's case on the construction of section m.p. act has all along been understood and justified on the basis of the presence of non obstante clause and the later decisions have distinguished it on that ground. the existence of non obstante clause in m.p. act was held to be the basis on which the decision in padma debi 's case was distinguished in ratnaprabha 's case itself. it assistant general manager central bank of india 's case supra it was contended on behalf of the appellant that even where the standard rent was not fixed and the $$$ act not applicable it must be presumed that the $$$$ rent for such buildings or lands or premises would be the standard rent al and not the actual rent received. in that case section of the municipal corporation act provided that the general taxes not less than % and not more than % of the rate able value of the buildings/ lands may be levied if the corporation so determines on a graduated scale. the expression rate able value was defined in clause of the section to mean the value of any building or land fixed whether with reference to any given premises or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this act and the rules for the purpose of assessment of property taxes. rule of the taxation rules provided that in order to fix the rate able value of any building land or premises there shall be deducted from the amount of the annual letting value of such building a sum equal to per cent of the annual letting value and the said deduction shall be in lieu of all allowances for repairs or any other account whatsoever. sub -clause ii of the definition provided that in relation to any other period the $$$$ rent for which any building or land or premises exclusive of furniture or machinery contained or situate therein or thereon might reasonably be expected to let from $$$$ with reference to its use and shall include all payments made or agreed to be made to the owners by a person other than the owner occupying the building or land or premises on account of occupation taxes insurance or other charges incidental thereto. the proviso added to sub -clause ii was to the following effect;"(a i)m respect of any building or land or premises the standard rent of which has been fixed under section of the bombay $$$s hotel and lodging house rates control act the $$$$ rent thereof shall not exceed the $$$$ amount of the standard rent so fixed;(aa in respect of any building or land or premises the standard rent of which is not fixed under section of the bombay $$$ hotel and lodging house rates control act the $$$$ rent received by the owner in respect of such building or land or premises shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be deemed to be the $$$$ rent for which such building or land or premises might reasonably be expected to let from $$$$ to $$$$ with reference to its use. dealing with the points in controversy the arguments urged and the issues involved the court held:"it is true that the bombay $$$ act defines what standard rent is provides for fixation of standard rent by the court and further provides that no landlord shall claim or receive any amount over and above the standard rent making the same punishable with imprisonment and fine. yet the fact remains that municipal corporations act says expressly that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the $$$$ rent received which means the actual rent received -in respect of building etc.for which standard rent is not fixed under section 11of the bombay $$$ act shall be deemed to be the $$$$ rent for which such building etc. for which such building etc. might reasonably be expected to be let from $$$$ with reference to its use. the validity of proviso aa though raised in the grounds of appeal in the special leave petition has not been urged before us probably advisedly. being a taxing enactment and also because the proviso does no more than to treat the actual rent received as the $$$$ rent the reasonableness of the said provision can hardly be questid. be that as it may we see no reason why the express language and command of proviso aa is not respected. both the enactments viz.bombay $$$ act and bombay provincial municipal corporations act are state enactments. indeed the municipal corporations act is a later enactment. in view of the express provision in proviso aa it must be held that for the purpose of the municipal corporation act the actual rent received is the $$$$ rent for the purposes of determining the $$$$ letting value. the counsel for the appellants say that it can not be. they say that state enactment can not be read so as to defeat and nullify the provisions of another state enactment. the submission is that both must be read harmoniously. the said argument in our opinion would have been perfectly justified if the non obstante clause were not there in proviso aa. in its presence acceptance of the said argument means that we ignore the non obstante clause in proviso aa altogether. such a course is not permissible to us. the court can not treat any provision in an enactment as superfluous much less can it ignore its existence. the learned counsel however rely upon certain decision in support of their submissions to which a brief reference would now be in order.accordingly we hold that proviso aa means what it says and has to be applied and followed in the cases covered by it. so far as the municipal corporations act is concerned the $$$$ rent is the actual rent received where the standard rent is not fixed under section of the bombay $$$ act and it constitutes the basis for determining the $$$$ letting value rate able value and property taxes. that is the plain effect and meaning of proviso aa. so far proviso aaa is concerned an apprehension was expressed that it would enable the commissioner to question the actual rent received in every case and it would bean endless enquiry. in our opinion however the said provision is conceived to meet situations where the rent pub forward as the actual rent received is not a genuine plea.i.where it is a false plea. a landlord may let out a building at less than market rent for many a reason e.g.the tenant is a close friend or a close relative or because the tenant is a charitable or religious organisation. $$$ aaa does not enable the commissioner to ignore such situations for in such cases the rent actually received is genuinely stipulated. this power is reserved to the commissioner only with a view to ensure that by merely putting forward a figure which is not true persons do not escape the correct levy. in east india commercial co. $$$. ltd.'s case supra)this court considered the determination of $$$$ value under section of the calcutta municipal corporation act in respect of buildings which were actually let out to tenants on rent agreed but not fixed by the $$$ under the $$$ restriction act for the purposes of assessment of property tax.after referring to the relevant provisions of law and the judgments of this court it was held:"from the aforesaid decisions the principle which is deducible is that when the municipal act requires the determination of the $$$$ value that act has to be read along with $$$ restriction act which provides for the determination of fair rent or standard rent. reading the acts together the rate able value can not be more than the fair or standard rent which can be fixed under the $$$ control act. the exception to this rule is that whenever any municipal act itself provides the modes of determination of the $$$$ letting value like the central bank of india case manu / sc/0742/1995manu / sc/0742/1995 relating to ahmedabad or contains a non obstante clause as in ratnaprabha case manu / sc/0339/1976manu / sc/0339/1976 1977]1scr1017 1977]1scr1017 then the determination of the $$$$ letting value has to be according to the terms of the municipal act. in the present case section of the municipal act does not contain any non obstante clause so as to make the tenancy act inapplicable and nor does the act itself provide the method of basis for determining the $$$$ value. this act has therefore to be read along with tenancy act of and it is the fair rent determinable under section which alone can be the $$$$ value for the purposes of property tax. dealing with the m.p. municipal corporation act the court held that the existence of n on obstante clause was crucial in determining the $$$$ value. the court observed in section of the municipal act with which were concerned in the present case the non obstante clause is not there. the municipal act is different from the m.p. municipal act. section of the municipal act is similar to the corresponding provisions in delhi and in $$$ and therefore it is the ratio of the decisions of $$$ / $$$ / sc/04/1961 $$$ scc and guntur municipal council manu / sc/0394/1970manu / sc/0394/1970 which should apply. in government servant cooperative 's case supra this court dealt with section of the delhi municipal corporation act providing for determination of rate able value of land or building assessable to property taxes and held that where there is a legislation fixing the standard rent of the premises the rent at which premises could be reasonable expected to be let can not exceed the statutory ceiling. but where there is no statutory control on rent which is charged the $$$$ rent actually received by the landlord shall be the basis for determining the rate able value of the property. it held:"therefore the $$$$ rent actually received by the landlord in the absence of any special circumstances would be a good guide to decide the rent which the landlord might reasonably expect to receive from a hypothetical tenant. since the premises in the present case are not controlled by any rent control legislation the $$$$ rent received by the landlord is what a willing lessee uninfluenced by other circumstances would pay to a willing lessor. hence actual $$$$ rent in these circumstances can be taken as the $$$$ rate able value of the property for the assessment of property tax. the municipal corporation is therefore entitled to revise the rate able value of the proprieties which have been freed from rent control on the basis of $$$$ rent actually received unless the owner satisfies the municipal corporation that there are other considerations which have affected the quantum of rent. a perusal of various judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties clearly shows that this court has taken a consistent view regarding the determination of $$$$ value of land or building of the purposes of determination of taxes under the $$$. on the basis of various statues relating to the determination of the $$$$ value for the purposes of municipal act this court has devised distinct groups. such group deals with the municipal laws of some states which do not expressly exclude application of $$$ restrictions acts in the matter of determination of $$$$ value of a building for the purposes of levying municipal taxes and the other group deals with the municipal laws which expressly exclude application of the $$$ restriction act in the matter of determination of annul value of land or building on rental method. whereas in the category of cases the determination of $$$$ value has to be made on the basis of fair or standard rent notwithstanding the actual rent even if it exceeds the statutory limits. in the other group where the restriction in the $$$ act has been excluded the determination of $$$$ value of building on rental method is referable to the method provided under the relevant municipal act. whereas the padma debi 's case lic 's case guntur town rate payee 's case dewan daulat rai 's case supra deal with the group of municipal laws the cases in $$$ 's case agm central bank of india 's case east india commercial company 's case balbir singh 's case india oil corporation 's case and $$$ 's case supra deal with the group. as already noticed this court in lic 's case dealt with the category as in section of the calcutta municipal corporation act there existed no non -obstante clause. the observations of the bench of this court which dealt with the case on 10th october can not be taken in isolation. $$$ j. in lic 's case referring to the proviso to section of the calcutta municipal corporation act which dealt with the land and building the standard rent of which had been fixed under section of the west bengal premises $$$ control temporary provisions act observe by the addition of the proviso in our judgment the meaning of the expression gross rent at which the land or building might reasonably be expected to let is not altered. in the present case there is no order of the controller fixing standard rent under section of the west bengal premises $$$ control temporary provisions act but the standard rent stands determined by the definition of that expression in section of that act which provides omitting paras not relevant):"standard rent in relation to any premises means xxx(b where the rent has been fixed under section the rent so fixed or at which it would have been fixed if application were made under the said section. as already noticed even without specific determination the standard rent was held to have been statutorily determined under section of the $$$ act. upon analysis of the various municipal laws and the judgments of this court it is held that in cases where the municipal laws excludes the applicability of the $$$ acts by incorporating on obstante clause in the taxing statute the powers of the authorities under the $$$ are not circumscribed by the limits indicated in padma debi 's case and followed in that group of cases. in cases were the fair rent payable by the tenant has been determined and there is no justification for refusing to accept that fair rent as rental value of the premises the municipal authorities should generally accept the standard rent fixed notwithstanding the non applicability of the $$$ acts because such a view would be reasonable guideline to determine the rate of rent at which such land or building might at the time of assessment be reasonably expected to let from $$$$. the rent which the tenant is receiving from his sub -tenant is also an important statutory consideration for determining the rent at the time of assessment to which the property might reasonably be expected to be let from $$$$. such a consideration is also justified on the principles of reasonableness. we can not agree that in all cases notwithstanding the non -obstante clause the $$$$ rental value can not be fixed beyond the standard rent determined or determinable under the $$$ statute. we also find it difficult to hold that in all cases the rent actually paid by the sub -tenant to the tenant be taken as a sole criterion for determining the $$$$ value on the assumption that such land or building might at the time of assessment is reasonably expected to get the aforesaid amount of rent if let from $$$$ to $$$$. the argument that the rent actually received by the owner should always be deemed to be reasonable rent in the absence of fraud collusion and other extraneous considerations is to general and broad proposition of law which can not be accepted for the purposes of determining the $$$$ value of the property for the purposes of section of the act. in the light of clear and unambiguous provisions of section of the act it can not be held that the amount realised by a tenant from a sub -tenant can not at all be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining the gross $$$$ rent in the absence of extraneous considerations. there is no substance in the submission of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant that allowing the municipal corporations to assess the $$$$ rate able value on the basis of the income of a tenant from the property would be grossly unfair and would have the effect of rendering the rate provisions of the act unreasonable arbitrary and unconstitutional. the act itself has taken care by making sufficient provision in sections and regarding the liability to pay the rent and apportionment of such liability when the premises are assessed let or sub -let. on proof of creation of sub -tenancy the owner of the building may also be entitled to seek eviction of their tenants under the relevant provisions of the rent acts applicable in the state where the land or property is located. we find some substance in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that permitting the municipal authorities to assess the $$$$ value only on the basis of the rent paid by the sub- tenant to the tenant and fixing its liability on the owner may adversely affect the owners of the buildings who have let their premises at a time when rents were meagre and who under the rent control $$$ are deprived of getting possession back of the lands and buildings from their tenants. the act therefore requires the application of mind by the municipal authorities to determine the rent son the basis of the reasonableness by keeping into account all relevant circumstances including the actual rent received by the owner hypothetical standard rent the rent being received by the tenant from his sub -tenant and other relevant consideration such as prevalent rate of rent of lands and building in the vicinity of the property being assessed. only because the owner of the building is not getting the same rent which the sub -tenant is paying to his lessor can not be made a basis to deprive the corporations from determining the $$$$ valuation and taxing the land or building on that basis. if such a plea is accepted it would be against he provisions of the state which has been enacted to provide civic services in the form of water drainage sewage collection removal and disposal of solid waste fire prevention and fire safety maintenance of street and public places etc.in the municipal area when such land or building is situate. we do not find any conflict in the judgments of this court so far as the determination of $$$$ value of the property under the municipal laws is concerned. $$$ if any is based upon the relevant provision of the state of a state with which this court was dealing particularly with respect to such $$$ which contained a non obstante clause. we are of the view that the basis for determination of $$$$ rent value has to be the standard rent where the rent control act is applicable and in all other cases reasonable determination of such rent by the municipal authorities keeping in view various factors as indicated herein earlier including the rent which the tenant is getting from his sub -tenant. in appropriate cases the owner of the property may be in a position to satisfy the authorities that the gross $$$$ rent of the building of which the $$$$ valuation was being determined can not be more than the actual rent received by such owner from his tenant. the municipal authorities shall keep in mind the various pronouncements of this court the statutory provisions made in the specified $$$ keeping in mind the applicability or non -applicability of the rent act and the peculiar circumstances of each case to find out the gross $$$$ rent of the building including service charges if any at which such land or building might at the time of assessment be reasonably expected to let from $$$$ to $$$$ in terms of section of the act. keeping in view the facts of the present appeal we are of the opinion that the high court was right in remanding the appeals to the appellate tribunal for deciding on merits but was not justified to restrict the consideration only on the basis of rent being paid by the sub -tenant to the tenant for the purposes of determining the gross $$$$ value. the appellate tribunal shall consider the appeals in the light of our judgment by keeping in mind all the circumstances including the rent actually received by the owner of the building and the rent being paid to the tenant by his sub -tenant. the appellate tribunal shall also keep in mind the peculiar circumstances of the case if any for determining the gross $$$$ rent at which the building in controversy at the time of assessment is reasonably expected to let from $$$$ to $$$$ leas the allowances and other considerations referred to in section of the act. if the $$$$ valuation determined is more than the gross $$$$ rent which the appellant is actually receiving from his tenant the appellant shall be at liberty to recover the excess amount paid in terms of section of the act. with these observations the appeal is disposed of costs to abide by the ultimate result.
