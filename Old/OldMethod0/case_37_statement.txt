while the deceased passenger was travelling in a goods vehicle and that vehicle met with an accident on account of which the passenger died or suffered bodily injury. originally when the bunch of appeals was being heard a bench of this court by order dated th march came to the conclusion that all the appeals fall in categories -category i being those cases which are covered by the provisions

finally heard a bench delivered judgment in respect of cases under category i and above on th august. but so far as cases falling under category namely which are covered under the motor vehicles act

goods vehicle and met with death on account of an accident. the tribunal however came to the conclusion that in view of the decision of the supreme court in the case of $$$ smt.and ors. v. oriental insurance co. ltd. and ors. -$$$ / sc/074/$$$ / sc/074/ airsc5 the insurer must be held liable and accordingly directed the compensation amount to be paid by the insurance company. the insurer carried an appeal to the high court but the high court disposed of the appeal solely on the ground that the case is covered by the decision of this court in the case of new india assurance company v. $$$ and ors. -scc. mr. rawat learned counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the decision in $$$ 's case on which the tribunal relied upon is a decision interpreting the provisions of the old act of and in fact that decision can not be of any assistance. in view of the fact that section proviso of motor vehicles act is not the same as section of the motor vehicles act as it stood prior to its amendment of. mr. rawat contended that the decision of this court in new india assurance co. v. satpal singh is undoubtedly based on an interpretation of the proviso to section of the motor vehicles act but that decision can not be held to be good law in as much as the court has not borne in mind the relevant provisions as it stood nor has it considered the effect of the amendment that was brought about in as well as the purpose of such amendment. the learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand contended that the subsequent amendment that was brought about in the year is merely clarificatory in nature and does not bring about any substantive change and further the act being a beneficial one construction which is beneficial to the victims of the accident should be followed. $$$ from that angle the decision of this court in new india assurance company v. $$$ and ors. supra does not require any reconsideration. under the motor vehicles act of the requirements of policies and limits of liability had been provided in section. $$$ to section of the said act unequivocally states that the policy shall not be required in case of a goods vehicle for passengers being carried in the said vehicle. in mallawwa smt.and ors. v. oriental insurance co. ltd. and ors. supra while approving the earlier decision of the court in pushpabai purshottam udeshi 's case -$$$ / sc/09/77$$$ / sc/09/77 the court construed the provisions of section 95()(b of the motor vehicles act and held that while the expression any person and the expression every motor vehicle are in wide terms but by proviso it restricts the generality of the main provision by confining the requirement to cases where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment therefore the vehicle had to be vehicle in which passengers are carried. the court further held that the goods vehicle can not be held to be a passenger vehicle even if the vehicle was found to be used on some stray occasions for carrying passengers for hire or reward. undoubtedly mallawwa 's case supra was dealing with a situation under the motor vehicle act. in satpal 's case supra the court assumed that the provisions of section of motor vehicles act are identical with section of the motor vehicles act as it stood prior to its amendment. but a careful scrutiny of the provisions would make it clear that prior to the amendment of it was not necessary for the insurer to insure against the owner of the goods of his authorised representative being carried in a goods vehicle. on an erroneous impression this court came to the conclusion that the insurer would be liable to pay compensation in respect of the death or bodily injury caused to either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative when being carried in a goods vehicle the accident occurred. if the motor vehicle amended act of is examined particularly section of the act of by which expression injury to any person in the original act stood substituted by the expression ' injury to any person including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle the conclusion is irresistible that prior to the aforesaid amendment act of even if widest interpretation is given to the expression to any person it will not cover either the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in the vehicle. the objects and reasons of clause also states that it seeks to amend section to include owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle for the purposes of liability under the insurance policy. it is no doubt true that sometimes the legislature amends the law by way of amplification and clarification of an inherent position which is there in the statute but a plain meaning being given to the words used in the statute as it stood prior to its amendment of and as it stands subsequent to its amendment in and bearing in mind the objects and reasons engrafted in the amended provisions referred to earlier it is difficult for us to construe that the expression including owner of the goods or his authorised representative carried in the vehicle which was added to the pre -existed expression injury to any person is either clarificatory or amplification of the pre -existing statute. on the other hand it clearly demonstrates that the legislature wanted to bring within the sweep of section and making it compulsory for the insurer to insure even in case of a goods vehicle the owner of the goods or his authorised representative being carried in a goods vehicle when that vehicle met with an accident and the owner of the goods or his representative either dies or suffers bodily injury. the judgment of this court in satpal 's case therefore must be held to have not been correctly decided and the impugned judgment of the tribunal as well as that of the high court accordingly are set aside and these appeals are allowed. it is held that the insurer will not be liable for paying compensation to the owner of goods or his authorised representative on being carried in a goods vehicle when that vehicle meets with an accident and the owner of goods or his representative dies or suffers any bodily injury.s.b. sinha j. leave granted in special leave petitions. though i respectfully agree with the judgment and order proposed to be delivered by $$$ the chief justice of india having regard to the importance of the questions involved in the matter i would like to add a few words of mine. it is not in dispute that in this batch of appeals the cause of action in each case arose prior to coming into force of amendment in the motor vehicles act and thus the effect thereof would have not bearing in the instant case. the controversy in the instant case centers round the changes effected in the motor vehicles act vis -a -vis the motor vehicles act. as would appear from the discussions made hereinafter a goods vehicle was required to be compulsorily covered by insurance policy in terms of act but was not so required in terms of act. before adverting to the pointed issue we may notice the definition of goods vehicles public service vehicle and stage carriage and transport vehicle occurring in sections and of act which are as under:-"2( goods vehicle means any motor vehicle constructed or adopted for use for the carriage of goods or any motor vehicle not so constructed or adapted when used for the carriage of goods solely or in addition to passengers:"" public service vehicle means any motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward and includes a motor cab contract carriage and stage carriage;"" stage carriage means a motor vehicle carrying or adapted to carry more than persons excluding the driver which carries passengers for hire or reward at separate fares paid by or for individual passengers either for the whole journey or for stages of the journey;"" transport vehicle means a public service vehicle or a goods. sections and of act define goods carriage public service vehicle stage carriage and transport vehicle in the following terms:-" good carriage any motor vehicle constructed or adapted for use solely for the carriage of goods or any motor vehicle not so constructed or adapted when used for the carriage of goods;"" public service vehicle means any motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward and includes a maxicab a motorcab contract carriage and stage carriage;""0 stage carriage means a motor vehicle constructed or adapted to carry more than passengers excluding the driver for hire or reward at separate fares paid by or for individual passengers either for the whole journey or for stages of the journey;""7 transport vehicle means a public service vehicle a goods carriage an educational institution bus or a private service vehicle;"7. the changes effected in the respective terminologies in the act have a bearing on the question involved in these appeals. chapter viii of act and chapter xi of act deal with insurance of motor vehicles against party risks. liability has been defined in section as under-"'liability wherever used in relation to the death of or bodily injury to any person includes liability in respect thereof under section. section specifies the necessity for insurance against party risk. in terms thereof an owner of a motor vehicle is statutorily enjoined to have a policy of insurance complying with the requirements of the said chapter before the uses or causes or allows any other person to use a motor vehicle in public. section deals with requirements of policies and limits of liability. $$$ appended thereto however makes an exception to the main provision which reads thus:-"provided that a policy shall not be required-(i to cover liability in respect of the death arising out of an in the course of his employment of the employee of a person insured by the policy or in respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment other than a liability arising under the workmen 's compensation act of in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee-(a engaged in driving the vehicle $$$$ if it is a public service vehicle engaged as conductor of the vehicle or in examining tickets on the vehicle or(c if it is a goods carriage being carried in the vehicle or(ii to cover any contractual liability. we may notice that the proviso appended to section of act contained clause ii which has been omitted in the act and reads as under:-"except where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment to cover liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to persons being carried in or upon or entering or mounting or alighting from the vehicle at the time of the occurrence of the event out of which a claim arises. thus it may be noticed that so far as employees of the owner of the motor vehicle are concerned an insurance policy was not required to be taken in relation to their liability other than arising in terms of the provisions of the workmen 's compensation act. on the other hand proviso appended to section of act enjoined a statutory liability upon the owner of the vehicle to take out an insurance policy to cover the liability in respect of a person who was travelling in a vehicle pursuant to a contract of employment. the legislative has consciously not inserted the said provision in act. the applicability of decision of this court in mallawwa smt.and ors. v. oriental insurance company ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/0749/998$$$ / sc/0749/998 air999sc589 in this case must be considered keeping that aspect in view. section of act does not include passengers in goods carriage whereas section of act did as even passengers could be carried in a goods vehicle. the difference in the definitions of the goods vehicle in act and goods carriage in act is significant. by reason of the change in the definitions of the terminology the legislature intended that a goods vehicle could not carry any passenger as the words in addition to passengers occurring in the definition of goods vehicle in act were omitted. furthermore it categorically states that goods carriage would mean a motor vehicle constructed or adapted for use solely for the carriage of goods. carrying of passengers in a goods carriage thus is not contemplated under act. we have further noticed that section of act prescribing the requirements of an insurance policy does not contain a provision similar to clause ii of the proviso appended to section of act. the decisions of this court in mallawwa 's case supra must be held to have been rendered having regard to the aforementioned provisions. section of act inter alia prescribes compulsory coverage against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of public service vehicle. $$$ appended thereto categorically states that compulsory coverage in respect of drivers and conductors of public service vehicle and employees carried in a goods vehicle would be limited to the liability under the workmen 's compensation act. it does not speak of any passenger in a good carriage. in view of the changes in the relevant provisions in act vis -a -vis act we are of the opinion that the meaning of the words any person must also be attributed having regard to the context in which they have been used i. a party. keeping in view the provisions of act we are of the opinion that as the provisions thereof do not enjoin any statutory liability on the owner of a vehicle to get his vehicle insured for any passenger travelling in a goods vehicle the insurers would not be liable therefore. furthermore sub -clauses i of clause b of sub -section of section speaks of liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place whereas sub -clause ii thereof deals with liability which may be incurred by the owner of a vehicle against the death of or bodily injury to any passenger of a public service vehicle caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place. an owner of a passenger carrying vehicle must be premium for covering the risks of the passengers. if a liability other than the limited liability provided for under the act is to be enhanced under an insurance policy additional premium is required to be paid. but if the ratio of this court 's decision in new india assurance company v. satpal singh and ors. $$$ / sc/0751/1999$$$ / sc/0751/1999 air2000sc235 is taken to its logical conclusion although for such passengers the owner of a goods carriage need not take out an insurance policy they would be deemed to have been covered under the policy where for even no premium is required to be paid. we may consider the matter from another angle. section of the act enables the insurers to raise defences against the claim of the claimants. in terms of clause c of sub -section of section of the act of the defences which is available to the insurer is that the vehicle in question has been used for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle was used. such a statutory defence available to the insurer would be obliterated in view of the decision of this court in satpal singh 's case supra. for the foregoing reasons. i am in respect agreement with my lord the chief justice of india that the decision of this court in new india assurance company v. satpal singh and ors. $$$ / sc/0751/1999$$$ / sc/0751/1999 air2000sc235 has not laid down the law correctly and should be overruled. the controversy in the instant case centers round the changes effected in the motor vehicles act vis -a -vis the motor vehicles act. as would appear from the discussions made hereinafter a goods vehicle was required to be compulsorily covered by insurance policy in terms of act but was not so required in terms of act.
