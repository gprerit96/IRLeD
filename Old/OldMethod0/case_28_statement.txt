. $$$ condoned. it appears that the high court has omitted to take note of the explanation under section of the income -tax act. therefore we are of the view that the $$$ should be granted liberty to approach the high court by way of a review petition. we permit the petitioner to file a review petition before the high court within month from $$$$ in which case the high court shall consider the matter on the merits. in view of the above the special leave petition is disposed of. pending interlocutory applications if any are disposed of.
