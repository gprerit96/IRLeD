scale in terms of rule thereof which reads as under:--"appointments to posts in the selection grade:- appointments to the posts in the selection grade of the service shall be made by the governor in consultation with the court on the basis of merit. on or about 0th of april a committee of hon'ble judges of the said court was constituted by the full court for the purpose of consideration of individual merit of the judicial officers of rajasthan higher judicial service rhjs relating to appointment to selection scale. pursuant to or in furtherance thereof a committee of judges considered the same and suggested that last years of acrs to be considered in the merit criteria therefore. however the full court by resolution dated th october took a decision to take into consideration good acrs out of acrs only for the said purpose. as regards grant of super time scale to rajasthan judicial service the full court of the high court by a resolution dated.adopted the criteria of good acrs out of acrs for grant of supertime scale. the acting chief justice of the high court however constituted a committee consisting of judges of the said court to consider examine and to make recommendations for formation of officiating promottee rhjs officers for their substantive appointment in their service and for promotion of rhjs officers in the ordinary scale to selection scale by an order dated th march. the committee submitted its report on 0th march upon considering the cases of all eligible candidates in the light of the existing rules as also the full court resolutions. with a view to arrive at its finding the committee however found those officers fit and meritorious for grant of selection grade who obtained at least outstanding very good good acrs out of and where no adverse entry was recorded. as regards those whose acrs have not been recorded for reason of the other the committee deferred consideration of their cases for the time being. the committee however filed an additional report on.whose cases were deferred earlier. the matter was placed before the full court on 0th april by the chief justice. twenty hon'ble judges of the high court participated therein. by resolution dated 0th april the full court considered the report submitted by the said judges committee and approved the name of officers who were found fit for grant of selection scale. the cases of the respondents herein along with others however were deferred. the matter relating to the additional report of the said judges committee was again placed before the full court on --. it accepted the report of the committee and declined to grant selection scale to the respondents herein. pursuant to or in furtherance of the aforementid recommendations made by the high court the governor by a notification dated.made appointment to the officers of higher judicial service named therein to the post of selection grade with effect from the date mentid against their names respectively. the respondent in each of these appeals filed writ petitions questioning non -grant of selection grade to them by filing writ petitions before the jaipur bench of the rajasthan high court. by reason of the impugned judgment the high court inter alia held:( the acting chief justice was not authorised to constitute the judges committee and thus it could not make lay down any merit criteria.as all the judges of the high court have not been consulted the committee appointed by the acting chief justice al could not evolve the merit criteria in view of sub -rule h of rule of rules.the earlier policy decision adopted by the full court could not be changed as rule of provides for prior consultation of the judges of the high court and as all judges were not consulted in the matter subsequent approval thereof could not cure illegality. the said writ petitions were disposed of with the following directions:-(i we direct the respondents to consider the cases of all the petitirs afresh against the vacancies occasid in and in view of the merit criterion evolved and approved by the full court in the year and. if they are found eligible for promotion to selection scale of the rhjs they can be accorded the selection scale by creating supernumerary posts in terms of rule of the rajasthan service rules.this decision shall not affect the order dated february whereby selection scale of the rhjs was granted to officers.the fresh consideration as directed above is expected to be d as expeditiously as possible in the meanwhile posts in the selection scale of the rhjs shall be kept vacant.however it was observed:"it is however made clear that though we have declared the entire exercise of the respondents in granting selection scale as illegal yet we do not intend to unsettle the grant of selection scale to judicial officers as they are not before us. we therefore direct that this decision shall not affect the order dated february of the respondent whereby selection scale was granted to judicial officers. but if the petitirs after consideration of their service record from to and from to are found eligible for selection scale they shall be considered with reference to the selection of and when their junior colleagues were promoted. the petitirs in that event can be accorded the selection scale of the rhjs by creating supernumerary posts in terms of rule of the rajasthan service rules. $$$ counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit that having regard to the provisions of the rules the high court must be held to have committed an error in holding that the acting chief justice had no jurisdiction to constitute the committee. it was contended that once it is held that the acting chief justice had the jurisdiction to constitute a committee and the decision of the said committee was approved by the full court the earlier policy decision must be held to have been varied by the high court. the learned counsel in support of the said contentions has placed strong reliance in state of uttar pradesh v. $$$ pati $$$ and $$$. $$$ / sc/0/7$$$ / sc/0/7 $$$ v state of u.p. and ors.registrar high court of madras v. r. $$$ $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/. mr. surya kant learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent in each case would on the other hand submit that as the power of the chief justice to constitute a committee is governed by a statutory rule he must be held to have acted without jurisdiction in appointing the said committee. strong reliance in support of the said contention has been placed in orissa small industries corporation ltd. and $$$. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/07/$$$ / sc/07/ )illjsc. the term chief justice will include the judges authorised to act on his behalf in view of the interpretation clause contained in section chapter of the rules provides for administrative business of the court. in terms of rule of the rules administrative business of the court relating to control over subordinate courts vested either under $$$ or of the constitution of india were to be disposed of as provided therein. the rules have been made by the high court. the high court therefore can also amend the rules. it is not the case of the writ petitirs -first respondents herein that the high court had no jurisdiction to evolve the criteria for grant of selection scale to the officers of the rajasthan judicial service or rajasthan higher judicial service. it may be true that by reason of resolution dated october the full court inter alia opined that for the purpose of grant of selection scale good acrs out of acrs were to be taken into consideration but the said decision of the full court was subject to amendment modification thereof. a reading of the aforementid rules clearly goes to show that the chief justice has the requisite jurisdiction to constitute a committee and the report of the committee upon consultation of all the judges of the high court in terms of rule shall become a decision of the court. rule and rule as quoted supra also clearly show that even no irregularity which might have taken place in the procedure laid down in chapter iii shall not affect the validity of the order passed or anything d in the rules and the same shall be deemed to be disposed of by the court. the legal fiction created must also be given its full effect. it is beyond any pale of controversy that the control over the subordinate courts within the meaning of article of the constitution of india is that of the high court. such control of the high court includes general superintendence of the working of the subordinate courts disciplinary control over the presiding officers disciplinary proceedings transfer confirmation and promotion and appointment etc. such control vested in the high court in complete. see high court of judicature for rajasthan v. ramesh chand paliwal $$$ / sc/07/$$$ / sc/07/ district judges baradakanta mishra v. high court of orissa $$$ / $$$ / sc/05/76 air76sc high court of punjab v. state of haryana $$$ / sc/007/75$$$ / sc/007/75 yoginath d. bagde v. state of maharashtra $$$ / sc/05/$$$ / sc/05/ airsc7 state of haryana v. inder prakash anand $$$ / sc/0547/76$$$ / sc/0547/76 air76sc and state of assam v. s.n. $$$ / sc/066/7$$$ / sc/066/7. it is also true that the powers of the chief justice under $$$ and of the constitution of india are different and distinct. whereas control over the subordinate courts vests in the high court as a whole the control over the high court vests in the chief justices only. see all india judges association v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/. however the same does not mean that a full court can not authorise the chief justice in respect of any matter whatsoever. in relation to certain matters keeping the rest of it in itself by the full court authorization to act on its behalf in favour of the chief justice on a committee of judges is permissible in law. how far and to what extent such power has been or can be delegated would be discernible only from the rules. such a power by the full court can also be exercised from time to time. the judges of the rajasthan high court as noticed hereinbefore in terms of sub -rule of rule of the rules authorised the chief justice to constitute a committee. such constitution of the committee by the chief justice having been made in terms of the rules must be held to have been made by the high court itself. such authorization is not a limited as thereby the extent to which such authorization an be exercised has not been spelt out. furthermore authorization in terms of sub -rule of rule of the rules having been laid down in chapter ii which relates to the administrative business of the court there can not be any doubt whatsoever even in the matter of control of the high court in terms of article of the constitution of india the chief justice of the high court had the jurisdiction to exercise the said power. once such a resolution authorising the chief justice to constitute a committee has been passed having regard to the decision of this court in the high court of judicature of bombay v. $$$ rangrao patil $$$ / sc/062/7$$$ / sc/062/7 there can not be doubt whatsoever that the exercise of power by the chief justice in that behalf was absolutely valid. it is therefore not correct to contend that the chief justice could appoint the -judges committee only with the approval of the full court. exercise of power by the chief justice however indisputably must be made in terms of the rules. the questions raised in these appeals must therefore be considered from that angle. the high court in our opinion therefore clearly erred in arriving at the aforementid finding that the constitution of the committee was illegal. the submission on behalf of the respondents to the effect that in the matter relating to fixation of criteria for the purpose of appointment to the selection grade the -judges committee could not be made without consulting all the judges is stated to be rejected. the said submission is based on a total misconception. laving down the merit criteria for appointment to the selection grade also was within the domain of the high court. it could not only lay down such criteria but also amend or modify the same from time to time. for the said purpose also the chief justice could appoint a committee the recommendation whereof was to be subject to the approval of the full court. rule of the rules does not say that before an action can be initiated in that behalf by the chief justice all the judges are to be consulted. rule of the rules postulates a final decision in the matter specified therein and not initiation of process therefore. it is also incorrect to contend that all the judges of the high court are required to be consulted at a time. the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents is again not correct in contending that the -judges committee was not justified in evolving a merit criteria different from the approved by the full court. the -judges committee did not take any final decision in that behalf. it having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and upon consideration of the extant rules as well as the earlier decisions of the full court applied certain principles and criteria which inevitably was subjected to approval of the full court. the procedure for holding a full court meeting as quoted supra would clearly show that the meeting which had requisite quorum as contemplated under rule would amount to compliance of the rules. although rule provides that all the judges shall be consulted in the matters enumerated therein but rule provides for the mode and manner thereof. if such consultation is to be made by circulation undoubtedly the relevant documents are required to be circulated to all the judges. in the event however such consultation is to be effected by placing the matter before a full court all the judges are therefore invited but the same would not mean that in the event or more $$$ does do not attend the full court the resolution passed by it shall be invalid. rule provides for a quorum. in the case of a meeting of the judges of the court the quorum will be complete if -half or more of the judges attend the same. consultation with all the judges would thus not mean that even if some of the judges do not choose to make themselves available in a full court meeting consultation with all the judges shall not be complete. we may notice that even in the full court meeting held on november all the hon'ble judges of the high court were not present. the committee was constituted for the purpose of considering the cases of concerned officers. it is not and can not be the case or the contention of the writ petitions that even for the purpose of considering the case of the eligible judicial officers at the threshold it was absolutely necessary to place the matter before the full court. the acting chief justice constituted the committee for a specific purpose. the committee merely submitted its opinion which was subject to approval by the full court. once the opinion of the matter is approved by the full court in our opinion it must be held that there had been a compliance of rule of the rules. interpretation of a statute depends upon the text and context thereof. a statute should be interpreted having regard to the purpose and object for which the same was made. the chief justice of a high court although amongst the judges by the nature of office he holds he is the head of the state judiciary. authorisation by the full court in favour of the chief justice to constitute a committee and/or take actions for the subordinate judiciary must be viewed from that context. rule of the rules provides for such matters which require consultations with the other judges of the high court. question of consultation with the judges would not arise unless the subject matter therefore is identified. it is for hon'ble the chief justice of the high court to identify such matters and place the same before the full court with relevant papers and documents. it is therefore axiomatic that not only the chief justice of high court was tree to initiate any proceedings and obtain the opinion of a committee of judges on such matters and the only legal requirement therefore is to place such proposals together with the opinion of the committee before the judges of the high court so that the matter can be fully thrashed out. once the full court approves the recommendations made by the committee of judges it becomes decision of the court which could be sent to the governor for acting thereupon. an almost identical question came up for consideration whether the high court can delegate its power to a judge or a shall committee of the judges of the court so as to authorise it to act on this behalf in state of uttar pradesh v. $$$ pati $$$ and $$$. supra. in no uncertain terms it would held:--..the control vested in the high courts by that article comprehends according to our decisions a large variety of matters like transfers subsequent postings leave promotions other than initial promotions imposition of minor penalties which do not fall within article decisions regarding compulsory retirements recommendations for imposition of major penalties which fall within article entries in character rolls and so forth. if every judge is to be associated personally and directly with the decision on every of these mattes several important matters pertaining to the high court 's administrative affairs will pile into arrears like court arrears. in fact it is no exaggeration to say that the control will be better and more effectively exercised if a smaller committee of judges has the authority of the court to consider the manifold matters falling within the purview of article. bearing in mind therefore the nature of the power which that article confers on the high court we are of the opinion that it is wrong to characterize as delegation the process whereby the entire high court authorises a judge or some of the judges of the court to act on behalf of the whole court. such an authorization effectuates the purpose of article and indeed without it the control vested in the high court over the subordinate courts will tend gradually to become lax and ineffective. administrative functions are only a part though an important part of the high court 's constitutional functions. judicial functions ought to occupy and do in fact consume the best part of a judge 's time. for balancing these -fold functions it is inevitable that the administrative duties should be left to be discharged by some on behalf of all the judges. judicial functions brook no such sharing of responsibilities by any instrumentality. in registrar high court of madras v. r. $$$ supra it was observed:"2. in $$$ 's case a review committee consisting of judges was appointed by a resolution of the high court. in the meeting of the review committee held on june to consider the case of the respondent $$$ only judges of the high court were present. the judges came to the conclusion that the respondent. $$$ should be compulsorily retired with effect from april. the division bench found that the judge had no notice of the meeting held on june but he agreed with the view expressed by the judges with a slight modification that the respondent would retire with effect from march under rule of the fundamental rules. the division bench of the high court took the view that as all the judges had not sat together and considered the question of compulsory retirement of respondent $$$ and that further the judge having also modified the decision of the judges namely that the respondent would be compulsorily retired with effect from march the impugned order of compulsory retirement of the respondent $$$ was vitiated. it is true that the members of the review committee should sit together and consider the question of compulsory retirement but simply because of them did not participate in the meeting and subsequently agreed with the view expressed by the other judges it would not vitiate the decision of the committee to compulsorily retire the respondent. the judge might sic not be justified in correcting the date with effect from which the respondent would compulsorily retire but that is a very minor issue and would not in our opinion make the decision invalid. in regard to the case of the other respondent namely. k. rajeswaran the high court took the view that the constitution of the review committee by the chief judge and not by the full court was illegal. we are unable to accept the view of the high court. we fail to understand why the chief justice can not appoint a review committee or an administrative committee. but in respect the high court is in our opinion correct namely that the decision of the review committee should have been placed before a meeting of the judges. in the case of the respondent k. rajeswaran the decision and recommendation of the review committee was not placed before the full court meeting. nor is there any material to show that the same was circulated to the judges. in that sense the recommendation of the review committee was not strictly legal. furthermore the terminology ' consultation used in rule having regard to purport and object thereof must be given its ordinary meaning. in words and phrases permanent $$$ition volume page to consult is defined as to discuss something together to deliberate. corpus juris secundum volume $$$. page also says that the word consult is frequently defined as meaning to discuss something together or to deliberate. by giving an opportunity to consultation or deliberation the purpose thereof is to enable the judges to make their respective points of view known to the others and discuss and examine the relative merits of their view. it is neither in doubt nor in dispute that the judges present in the meeting of the full court were supplied with all the requisite documents and had full opportunity to deliberate upon the agenda in question. there is another aspect of the matter which may require consideration. for all intent and purport the report of the judges committee has been approved by the full court. once approved it terminated into a decision of the full court itself. in the instant case even the governor has acted upon the recommendations of the high court. the writ petitioners - respondents herein did not question the appointments of the appointees not the high court. thus there can not be any doubt whatsoever that for all intent and purport the opinion of the judges committee received approval at the hands of the full court. the high court in our opinion further committed a manifest error in arriving at its conclusion in so far as it failed to take into consideration that rule does not postulate the prior approval of the full court in relation to any action which may be initiated by the chief justice. when an approval is required an action holds goods. only if it disapproved it losses its force. only when a permission is required the decision does not become effective till permission is obtained. see u.p. avas evam vikas parishad and $$$. v. friends coop housing society ltd and anr. $$$ / sc/0024/996$$$ / sc/0024/996. in the instant case both the aforementioned requirements have been fulfilled. there is another aspect of the matter. in terms of rule of the rules the decision of the full court would have a retrospective effective and retrospective operation. in any view of the matter even in a case where the initial action is illegal the same can be ratified by a body competent therefore. this aspect of the matter has not been considered by the high court at all. in sir parmeshwari prasad gupta v. the union of india $$$ / sc/095/97$$$ / sc/095/97 this court held..even if it be assumed that the telegram and the letter terminating the services of the appellant by the chairman was in pursuance to the invalid resolution of the board of directors passed on december to terminate his services it would not follow that the action of the chairman could not be ratified in a regularly convened meeting of the board of directors. the point is that even assuming that the chairman was not legally authorised to terminate the services of the appellant he was acting on behalf of the company in doing so because he purported to act in pursuance of the invalid resolution. therefore it was open to a regularly constituted meeting of the board of directors to ratify that action which though unauthorized was done on behalf of the company. ratification would always relate back to the date of the act ratified and so it must be held that the services of the appellant were validly terminated on december.. see also marathwada university v. seshrao balwant rao chavan $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99 $$$ and ors. v bar council of kerala and ors. $$$ / sc/06/999$$$ / sc/06/999 and barnard v. national dock labour board all er. in orissa small industries corporation ltd. and anr. v. $$$ and ors. supra where upon the learned counsel has placed strong reliance this court held..that apart the court is not entitled to assess the respective merit of the candidates for adjudging their suitability for being promoted and the only right the employee has is a right of consideration. the said right of consideration not having been infringed in the present case the high court was not justified in issuing the impugned direction for reconsideration of his case.. the said decision therefore mutilates against the contentions of the respondents. furthermore the respondent herein in these cases shri p.p. singh shri g.p. pandey has been granted selection scale in rhjs with effect from.and shri p.k. bhatia has been given with effect from.. shri p.p. singh has also retired from service on superannuation. we are of the opinion that impugned judgment of the high court can not be sustained which is set aside accordingly. the appeals are allowed but in the facts and circulation of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
