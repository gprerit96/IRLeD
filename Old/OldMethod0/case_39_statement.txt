that the accusations against appellant $$$ have been found established accordingly convicted him under section of the act and sentenced him to undergo $$$ for years and to pay a fine of rs. lakh with default condition of further ri for year. $$$ challenged the conviction and sentence before the high court. primary stand was that accused had been arrested on.and telegram had been sent in that regard to the police officials. it was contended that when benefit of doubt has been given to the other co -accused persons there was no basis for convicting the accused -appellant. there was no material to show any conscious possession which is sine qua non for conviction under section of the act. in any event requirements of section were not complied with. high court discarded the plea regarding arrest of $$$ on.on the ground that the evidence on record establishes that the application / telegram was received on.and merely because an earlier date was indicated it can not be said that the accused was really arrested on.. coming to the plea of conscious possession it was held that the prosecution had produced ample evidence that accused was in physical possession and in terms of section of the act conscious possession was presumed unless proved to the contrary. accused has failed to do so. therefore conscious possession was established. accordingly the appeal filed by the accused was dismissed. it was further held that section has no application because there was no personal search of the applicant. consequentially conviction and sentence were upheld. $$$ counsel appearing for the accused -appellant submitted that the facts of the case greatly resemblance with that of avtar singh and ors. v. state of punjab. since conscious possession has not been proved the conviction of the accused -appellant can not be stand on a different footing from those co -accused who have been acquitted. $$$ -compliance with requirements of section of the act vitiates the conviction. in response learned counsel for the respondent-(sic submitted that conscious possession has been established and by application of logic of section of the act when physical possession is established there is presumption of conscious possession. merely because co -accused persons have been acquitted that can not be a factor to hold the accused -appellant innocent. it is submitted that since there was no personal search. section of the act has no application. whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to the factual backdrop. the facts which can be culled out from the evidence on record is that the accused was sitting atop gunny bags containing the contraband articles. section makes possession of contraband articles an offence. section appears in chapter iv of the act which relates to offence for possession of such articles. it is submitted that in order to make the possession illicit there must be a conscious possession. it is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with requisite mental element i. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the nature of such possession section is not attracted. the expression possession is polymorphous term which assumes different colours in different contexts. it may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. it is impossible as was observed in superintendent & remembrancer of legal affairs west bengal v. $$$ bhunja and ors. $$$ / sc/066/979$$$ / sc/066/979 to work out a completely logical and precise definition of possession uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. the word conscious mean awareness about a particular fact. it is a state of mind which is deliberate or intended. as noted in $$$ v. the state of m.p. $$$ / sc/030/$$$$$$$ / sc/030/$$$$ possession in a given case need not be physical possession but can be constructive having power and control over the article in case in question while the person whom physical possession is given holds it subject to that power or control. the word possession means the legal right to possession see health v. drown all er. in an interesting case it was observed that where a person keeps his fire arm in his mother 's flat which is safer than his own home he must be considered to be in possession of the same. see sullivan v. $$$ all er. once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. section of the act gives a statutory recognition of this position because of presumption available in law. similar is the position in terms of section where also presumption is available to be drawn from possession of illicit articles. this position was highlighted in $$$ and anr. v. state of $$$ / sc/0599/2003$$$ / sc/0599/2003. in the factual scenario of the present case not only possession but conscious possession has been established. it has not been shown by the accused -appellant that the possession was not conscious in the logical background of sections and of the act. now comes the question whether there was non -compliance of section of the act. a bare reading of section shows that it only applies in case of personal search of a person. it does not extend to search of a vehicle or a container or a bag or premises. see $$$ v. state of maharashtra and anr. $$$ / sc/0662/99$$$ / sc/0662/99 the state of punjab v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/0981/99 $$$ v. state of haryana manu / sc/0083/2001manu / sc/0083/2001. the language of section is implicitly clear that the search has to be in relation to a person as contrasted to search of premises vehicles or articles. this position was settled beyond doubt by the constitution bench in baldev singh 's case supra. above being the position the contention regarding non -compliance of section of the act is also without any substance. the decision in avtar singh and ors. v. state of punjab was rendered in a different factual background. in that case the articles were being carried in a truck. there were several persons in the truck. it had not been established by evidence that any of them had any conscious possession. that also was not the only factor taken note of. while the accused was examined under section of the code of criminal procedure for short the code the essence of accusations was not brought to his notice more particularly with possession aspect. it was also noticed that the possibility of the accused persons being labourers of the truck was not ruled by the evidence. since the decision was rendered on consideration of several peculiar factual aspects specially noticed in that case it is of no assistance to the accused also. circumstantial flexibility additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in cases or between accused in the same case. each case depends on its own facts and a close similarity between case and another is not enough because a single significant detail may alter the entire aspect. it is more pronounced in criminal cases where the backbone of adjudication is fact based. we find no substance in this appeal which deserves dismissal and we so direct.
