seek. no. of. this special leave petition is directed against an interim order dated 19th january passed by the high court of madhya pradesh at jabalpur in writ petition no. of filed in public interest. the high court has upon a prima facie consideration of the matter declined to issue any interim directions restraining tourism activities within the core and critical areas of tiger reserves in the state of madhya pradesh. several directions have been issued by this court from time to time pursuant whereto the national tiger conservation authority has by a notification dated $$$$ notified comprehensive guidelines for tiger conservation and tourism. part b of the said $$$ titled $$$ for tourism in and around tiger reserves sets out the broad parameters within which such tourism activities have been permitted. when the matter came up before this court on 16th october this court noted the $$$ aforementioned and while modifying interim order dated 2th july directed that henceforth tourism activities will be strictly in accordance with the said $$$. this court also directed the authorities concerned to ensure that the requirements in the aforesaid $$$ are complied with before tourism activities are recommenced. it was clarified that the validity of notification dated 1th october had not been examined and that any party feeling aggrieved of the said notification would be free to challenge the same before an appropriate forum. in the circumstances therefore and keeping in view the above subsequent developments which sufficiently protect the core and critical areas of tiger reserves in terms of the $$$ issued on the subject we see no reason to keep these proceedings pending with us any further. $$$ for the petitioner however submitted that although the impugned order was only an interim order the high court has disposed off the main writ petition on 7th november on the ground that this court was now seized of the matter. she submits that some progress has no doubt been made in the direction of protecting the tiger population in the country on account of the interim orders passed by this court yet much more remains to be done for which purpose the writ petition could be restored before the high court for being taken to its logical conclusion on its merit. we see no reason why the petitioner should not have the liberty to approach the high court for restoration of the writ petition especially when we have not examined any other aspect of the matter in the proceedings before us inasmuch as the challenge before us was only to the refusal of an interim order by the high court. in the circumstances we dispose off the special leave petition with the observations that the petitioner shall be free to have writ petition no. of filed by it restored before the high court for any further direction that he may seek. we make it clear that we have expressed no opinion on the merits of anyone of the contentions that may be open to the parties in the said writ petition including those relating to the validity of the notification already issued for any matter relevant or incidental thereto. this order shall also dispose off writ petitions civil no. of and of and all applications filed therein reserving liberty for the parties in those cases to seek redress in appropriate proceedings if so advised before the high court. no
