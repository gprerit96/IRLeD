s.n. variava j. leave granted. this appeal is against a judgment dated th may. briefly stated the facts are as follows the appellant and the $$$ are family members who had disputes and differences in respect of the family businesses and properties. all the parties agreed to resolve their disputes and differences through mr. $$$ khaitan. $$$sequently on th september they agreed that the said mr. $$$ khaitan and mr. $$$ resolve their disputes. for the purposes of this order we are not deciding whether these persons acted as arbitrators or mediators. that is a matter of contention between the parties which we are at present not called upon to decide. for the purposes of this order we are presuming that the parties had agreed to the arbitration of these persons. the parties made their respective claims before these persons. all parties participated in the proceedings. on october an award came to be passed by the said mr. $$$ khaitan and mr. $$$. on nd december the st respondent filed an application in the calcutta high court for setting aside the award dated october. on $$$$ the nd respondent filed an application for setting aside this award. of the grounds in both these applications was that the arbitration was by arbitrators whereas under the arbitration and conciliation act hereinafter called the said act there can not be an even number of arbitrators. it was contended that an arbitration by arbitrators was against the statutory provision of the said act and therefore void and invalid. it was contended that consequently the award was unenforceable and not binding on the parties. these contentions found favour with a single judge of the calcutta high court who set aside the award on th november. on th may the appeal was also dismissed. hence this appeal to this court. when this matter reached hearing on th january the following order has been passed by this court:"$$$stitution applications are allowed.a similar question as is involved in this case came up before a bench of this court in the case of dodsal private ltd. v. delhi electric supply undertaking of the municipal corporation of delhi $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/. in that case this court felt that the question whether a mandatory provision of the arbitration act can at all be waived requires consideration by a larger bench in view of an earlier judgment of this court in waverly jute mills co. ltd. v. $$$ and co. india p. ltd. $$$ / sc/000/$$$ / sc/000/. in the said view of the matter the bench referred the question to a larger bench of this court. it is now noticed that the said constitution bench which was seized of the referred case did not decide that issue as could be seen from its decision dated th july in dodsal private ltd. v. delhi electric supply undertaking of the municipal corporation of delhi but decided the issue on other grounds.since that question has not yet been decided and question involved is an important question of law likely to arise in future cases we feel it appropriate that this issue should be decided by larger bench of at least hon'ble judges and hence refer the petitions namely slp c and of to a bench of hon'ble judges.accordingly the registry is directed to place the papers before hon'ble the chief justice for suitable orders. accordingly this matter is before this bench. at this stage we are only deciding the question of law referred i. whether a mandatory provision of the said act can be waived by the parties. it would be appropriate to set out at this stage the relevant provisions of the said act. sections and read as follows:". waiver of right to object. -a party who knows that any provision of this part from which the parties many derogate or(b any requirement under the arbitration agreement has not been complied

competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction. -the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement and for that purposes,-(a an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.a plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised

of the submission to arbitration;provided that if the decision on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated form those not so submitted only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside or(v the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties can not derogate or failing such agreement was not in accordance with this part or(b the court finds that-(i the subject -matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the time being in force the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of india. the said act was enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic and international commercial arbitration and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. of the objects of the said act is to minimise the role of courts in the arbitration process. it is with this object in mind that section has been provided. judicial authorities should not interfere except where so provided in the act. further section categorically provides that the award can be set aside by the court only on the grounds mentid therein. therefore of the aspects which would have to be considered is whether the st and nd $$$ case fell within any of the categories provided under section. mr. venugopal submits that section of the said act is a mandatory provision which can not be derogated. he points out that even though the parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators such number can not be an even number. he submits that any agreement which permits the parties to appoint an even number of arbitrators would be contrary to this mandatory provision of the said act. he submits that such an agreement would be invalid and void as the arbitral tribunal would not have been validly constituted. he submits that composition of the arbitral tribunal itself being invalid the proceedings and the award even if be passed would be invalid and unenforceable. mr. venugopal submits that section of the said act would only apply provided a party knew that he could derogate from any provision of this part or(b a party knew that any requirement under the arbitration agreement had not been complied withand the party still proceeded with the arbitration. he submits that this case does not fall under category above. he submits that even category a would not apply because wavier can only be in respect of a matter from which a party could derogate. he submits that in respect of provisions which are $$$ -derivable there can be now waiver. he submits that section is a provisions from which a party can not derogate. he submits that matters from which a party can not derogate are those provided in sections and and and and. he submits that as against this matters from which a party can derogate are those provided under section and and and. mr venugopal submits that section compulsorily precludes appointment of an even number of arbitrators in public interest and as a matter of public policy. he submits that if there are an even number of arbitrators there is a high possibility that at the end of the arbitration they may differ. he submits that in such a case parties would then be left remediless and would have to start litigation or afresh arbitration all over again. he submits that this would result in a colossal waste of time money and energy. he submits that to avoid such waste of time money and energy the legislature has in public policy provided in a non -derogatory manner that the number of arbitrators shall not be even. he submits section does not provide for any challenge tot he composition of the arbitral tribunal. he submits that a reading of section shows that the legislature contemplated a challenge to the composition of the arbitral tribunal. he submits that significantly section does not provide for a challenge to the composition of the arbitral tribunal. he submits that an invalid composition of the arbitral tribunal goes to the root of the jurisdiction. he submits that an arbitral tribunal which has been illegal constitute would have no jurisdiction or power to decide on the question of its inherent lack of jurisdiction. he submits that section does not cover and would not govern such a challenge. mr venugopal submits that the high court was right in setting aside the award on this ground. he submits that this court should not interfere. on the other hand mr. $$$ submits that section and and are part of the integrated scheme provided in the said act. he submits that the provisions have to be read in a manner where by there is no conflict between any of them or by which nay provision is not rendered nugatory. he submits that undoubtedly section $$$$provides that there should not be an even number of arbitrators. he points out that section starts with the words the parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators. he submits that arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties. he submits that generally in an arbitration the parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators and the procedure. parties could agree upon an even number of arbitrators. he submits that even after a party has agreed to an even number of arbitrators he can still object to the composition of the arbitral tribunal. he submits that such objection must be taken before the arbitral tribunal not later than the date of submission of the statement of defence. he points out that under section such an objection can be taken even though the parties had appointed or participated in the appointment of the arbitrator. he submits that the wording of section are wide enough to cover even an objection to the composition of the arbitral tribunal. he submits an objection that a conjoint reading of sections and indicates that if an objection is not taken before the arbitral tribunal within the time laid down under section then the party would be deemed to have waived its right to object by virtue of section. he submits that an award could be challenged on ground of composition of the arbitral tribunal only provided that an objection is taken before the arbitral tribunal under section and the arbitral tribunal has rejected such an objection. mr. $$$ submits that section does not permit the setting aside of an award on the ground of composition of the arbitral tribunal if the composition was in accordance with the agreement of the parties. he submits that section would come into play only if the composition was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. he points out that in this case the composition is in accordance with the agreement of the parties and therefore the award can not be set aside on this ground. mr. $$$ submits that even presuming that section permitted a challenge on the ground of composition of the arbitral tribunal still the court may refuse to set aside the award. he points out that the words used in section are an arbitral award may be set aside by the court. he submits that in this case the respondent had entered in to such an agreement. he submits that they had participated in the arbitral proceedings without any objection. he submits that there could be no law which permits a party who has so appointed and participated to then resile and seek to have the award set aside. he submits that it would be against public policy to permit waste of time money and energy spent in the arbitration by having the award set aside. he submits that it would also be inequitable to permit such a party to challenge the award on this ground. he submit that the impugned orders of the high court can not be sustained and require to be set aside. we have heard the parties at length.we have considered the submissions. undoubtedly section provides that the number of arbitrators shall not be an even number. the question still remains whether section is a $$$ -derivable provision. in our view the answer to this question would depend on question as to whether under the said act a party has a right to object to the composition of the arbitral tribunal if such composition is not in accordance with the said act and if so at what stage. it must be remembered that arbitration is a creature of an agreement. there can be no arbitration unless there is an arbitration agreement in writing between the parties. in the said act provisions have been made in sections for challenging the competence impartiality and jurisdiction. such challenge must however be before the arbitral tribunal itself. it has been held by a constitution bench of this court in the case of konkan railway corporation ltd. v. rani construction pvt. ltd. $$$ / sc/003/0$$$ / sc/003/0 that section enables the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. it has been held that under section the arbitral tribunal can rule on any objection with respect to existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. it is held that the arbitral tribunals authority under section is not confined to the width of its jurisdiction but goes also to the root of its jurisdiction. not only this decision is binding on this court but we are in respectful agreement with the same. thus it is no longer open to contend that under section party can not challenge the composition of the arbitral tribunal before the arbitral tribunal itself. such a challenge must betaken under section not later than the submission of the statement of defence. section makes it clear that such a challenge can be taken even though the party may have participated in the appointment of the arbitrator and/or may have himself appointed the arbitrator. needless to state a party would be free if he so choose not to raise such a challenge. thus a conjoint reading of sections and shows that an objection to the composition of the arbitral tribunal is a matter which is derogable. it is derogable because a party is free not to object within the time prescribed in section. if a party chooses not to so object there will be a deemed waiver under section. thus we are unable to accept the submission that section is a non -derivable provision. in our view section has to be read along with section and is therefore a derogable provision. we are also unable to accept mr. venugopal 's argument that as a matter of public policy section should be held to be non -derogable. even thought the said act is now an integrated law on the subject of arbitration it can not and does not provide for all contingencies. an arbitration being a creature of agreement between the parties it would be impossible for the legislature to cover all aspects. just by way of example section permits the parties to determine the number of arbitrators provided that such number is not an even number. section permits parties to agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators. section then provides how arbitrators are to be appointed if the parties do not agree on a procedure or if there is failure of the agreed procedure. a reading of section would show that it only provides for appointments in cases where there is only arbitrator or arbitrators. by agreement parties may provide for appointment of or arbitrators. if they do not provide for a procedure then section does not contain any provision for such a contingency. can this betaken to mean that the agreement of the parties is invalid. the answer obviously has to be in the negative. undoubtedly the procedure provided in section will mutatis mutandis apply for appointment of or or more arbitrators. similarly even if parties provide for appointment of only arbitrators that does not mean that the agreement becomes invalid. under section the arbitrators should then appoint a arbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator. such an appointment should preferably be made at the beginning. however we see no reason why the arbitrators can not appoint a arbitrator at a later stage i. if and when they differ. this would ensure that on a difference of opinion the arbitration proceedings are not frustrated. but if the arbitrators agree and give a common award there is no frustration of the proceedings. in such a case their common opinion would have prevailed even if the arbitrator presuming there was had differed. thus we do not see how there would be waste of time money and expense if a party with open eyes agrees to go to arbitration of persons and then participates in the proceedings. on the contrary there would be waste of time money and energy if such a party is allowed to resile because the award is not of his liking. allowing such a party to resile would not be in furtherance of any public policy and would be most inequitable. even otherwise under the said act and grounds of challenge to an arbitral award are very limited. now an award can be set aside only on a ground of challenge under section and provided such a challenge is raised before the arbitral tribunal and has been rejected by the arbitral tribunal. the only other provision is section of the said act. the only ground which could be pressed in service by mr. venugopal is that provided under section. section has been extracted herein above. according to mr. venugopal if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure even thought it may be in accordance with the agreement of the parties is in conflict with a provision of the act from which the parties can not derogate then the party is entitled to have the award set aside. he submits that the words unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this part from which the parties can not derogate as well as the words failing such agreement show that an award can be set aside if the agreement is in conflict with a provision of part i of the said act or if there is no agreement which is in consonance with the provisions of part i of the said act. in other words according to mr. venugopal even if the composition or procedure is in accordance with the agreement of the parties an award can be set aside if the composition or procedure is in conflict with theprovisions of part i of the said act. according to mr. venugopal the words failing such agreement do not mean that there should be no agreement in respect of the composition of the tribunal or the arbitral procedure. according to mr. venugopal an agreement in respect of the composition of the arbitral tribunal or arbitral procedure which is not in consonance with a provision of part i of the said act would be invalid in law and therefore would be covered by the phrase failing such agreement. he submits that the words failing such agreement mean failing an agreement which is in consonance with a provision of part i of the said act. he submits that section entitles the respondents to challenge the award and have it set aside. in our view section can not be read in the manner as suggested. section only applies if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. these opening words make it very clear that if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure is in accordance with the agreement of the parties as in this case then there can be no challenge under this provision. the question of unless such agreement as in conflict with the provisions of this act would only arise if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure is not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. when the composition or the procedure is not in accordance with the agreement of the parties then the parties get aright to challenge the award. but even in such a case the right to challenge the award is restricted. the challenge can only be provided the agreement of the parties is in conflict with a provision of part i which the parties can not derogate. in other words even if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure is not in accordance with the agreement of the parties but if such composition or procedure is in accordance with the provisions of the said act then the party can not challenge the award. the words failing such agreement have reference to an agreement providing for the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure. they would come into play only if there is no agreement providing for the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure. if there is no agreement providing for the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure and the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with part i of the said act then also a challenge to the award would be available. thus so long as the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure are in accordance with the agreement of the parties section does not permit challenge to an award merely on the ground that the composition of the arbitral tribunal was in conflict with the provisions of part i of the said act. this also indicates that section is a derogable provision. respondents and not having raised any objection to the composition of the arbitral tribunal as provided in section they must be deemed to have waived their right to object. for the reasons aforesaid the judgment of the learned single judge and the division bench on the question of law discussed can not be sustained. they are accordingly set aside. the appeal be now placed before a bench of judges for consideration of other aspects which are stated to have been raised.s.n. variava j. the question of law having been decided in the judgment dated 20th february passed in civil appeal no. of arising out of slp c no. of this appeal be now placed before a bench of judges for consideration of other aspects which are stated to have been raised.
