s.n. variava j. this appeal is against a judgment dated th april. briefly stated the facts are as follows the $$$ claims that by $$$ of settlement dated 2th april the land was settled in favour of $$$ prasad. on 1th february by virtue of section of the bihar land reforms act the land vested in the state of bihar. the $$$ claims that the state has been receiving rent from the said $$$ prasad. on th february the said $$$ prasad sold the said land to the $$$ by a registered $$$. on 1th may a notice was issued to the $$$ under section of the bihar land encroachment act. the $$$ replied to the notice. $$$ these proceedings were pending on january a notification was issued under section of the land acquisition act hereinafter called the said act. this was followed by a declaration under section on 2th may. the $$$ filed a claim under section of the said act. similarly the circle officer on behalf of the state filed a claim under section of the said act. an award came to be passed in favour of the appellant on 1th february. the state filed a reference under section of the said act for determination of the title. the state claimed that they were entitled to receive compensation. on september the land acquisition judge held in favour of the appellant. the state then filed an appeal which was dismissed on 2th april. the state then filed a $$$ before the division $$$. this $$$ was allowed by the impugned judgment dated 1st may. the case has been remanded back to the single judge for decision in the light of the observations made by the division $$$. when this matter reached hearing on 1st january the following $$$ has been passed by this court:"one of the questions that arises for consideration in this case is as to whether $$$ was maintainable before $$$ $$$ against the judgment and decree of the learned single judge of the high court passed in an appeal preferred under section of the land acquisition act. in civil appeal nos. -of baljit singh and ors. etc. v. state of haryana and ors.a $$$ of judges of this court held that no $$$ is maintainable against the judgment of the learned single judge of the high court whereas in the case of $$$ v. union of india manu / sc//1manu / sc//1 a $$$ of judges without adverting to the decision in baljit singh and ors. etc. v. state of haryana and ors.supra held that such an appeal is maintainable.we have heard learned counsel for the parties.on a plain reading of section of the land acquisition act we are prima facie of the view that no $$$ is maintainable. however since no reason has been assigned in the case of $$$ v. union of india supra for holding that the letters paten appeal is maintainable against the judgment of a single judge of the high court passed in an appeal filed under section of the act we are of the view that this case requires to be decided by a $$$ of hon'ble judges.let this matter be placed before hon'ble the chief justice of india for appropriate orders.hence the appeal has been placed before us. in the case of baljit singh and ors. etc. v. state of haryana and ors.judges of this court have held as follows:"the short question raised is whether the $$$s were maintainable under the law. the learned counsel for the appellants agreed that such appeals did not lie on the authority of a judgment of this court in asia industries v. sarup manu / sc/0046/5manu / sc/0046/5 where a judge bench has clearly held that such an appeal does not lie. on this authority the judgment of the division $$$ of the high court has to be vacated and consequently the decision of the learned single judge has got to be restored. the judgment in baljit singh 's case is based on a concession. it is also based on the judgment in asia industries case. the judgment in asia industries case does not deal with section of the said act. in asia industries case the question was whether a $$$ would lie against a decision of the single judge $$$ passed in an appeal filed under $$$ of the delhi rent control act. $$$ considering this question it was observed as follows:"the following legal position emerges from the said discussion a statute may give a right of appeal from an order of a tribunal or a court to the high court without any limitation thereon. the appeal to the high court will be regulated by the practice and procedure obtaining in the high court. under the rules made by the high court in exercise of the powers conferred on it under section of the government of india act an appeal under section of the act will be heard by a single judge. any judgment made by the single judge in the said appeal will under clause of $$$ be subject to an appeal to that court. if the order made by a single judge is a judgment and if the appropriate legislature has expressly or by necessary implication not taken away the right of appeal the conclusion is inevitable that an appeal shall lie from the judgment of a single judge under clause of $$$ to the high court. it follows that if the act had not taken away $$$ appeal an appeal shall certainly lie from the judgment of the single judge to the high court.thus the court holds that a $$$ will lie unless the concerned statute takes away the right to file $$$. the court then considered sections and delhi rent control act and held that a combined reading of the sections showed that the $$$ passed by the high court in an appeal under section was to be final. it was held that the provision of finality was intended to exclude any further appeal. this decision is thus based on interpretation of sections and of the delhi rent control act. section of the said act has no similarity with sections and of the delhi rent control act. asia industries case does not lay down that a letters patent appeal would not lie against a judgment passed in an appeal under section of the said act. thus the case has no relevance whilst deciding the question whether a letters patent appeal is maintainable against a judgment passed in an appeal under section of the said act. in our view the concession made in baljit singh 's case was wrong. a judge $$$ of this court has in basant kumar 's case supra held as follows:"the next question is whether the lpa would lie against the judgment of the learned single judge it is a settled legal position that under section of the land acquisition act the appeal would lie to the high court when the appeal on the basis of the pecuniary value was decided by a single judge necessarily it being the judgment of the single judge an appeal would lie to the same court in the form of lpa to the division $$$. the division bench was not right in holding that the lpa would not lie to the high court against the judgment of the single judge. to that extent the view of the high court is not correct. a letters patent is the charter under which the high court is established. the powers given to a high court under $$$ are akin to the constitution powers of a high court. thus when a letters patent grants to the high court a power of appeal against a judgment of a single judge the right to entertain the appeal would not get excluded unless the concerned statutory enactment excludes an appeal under $$$. the question which thus arises is whether section of the said act excludes an appeal under the letters patent. section of the said act reads as under:". appeals in proceedings before court.to the provisions of the code of civil procedure applicable to appeals from original decrees and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force an appeal shall only lie in any proceedings under this act to the high court from the award or from any part of the award of the court and from any decree of the high court passed on such appeal as aforesaid an appeal shall lie to the supreme court subject to the provisions contained in section of the code of civil procedure and in order xliv thereof. mr. sharan submits that section of the said act contains a non -obstante clause. he submits that the words notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any enactment for the time being in force would also include the provisions contained in a letters patent. we are unable to accept this submission. a letter patent is not an enactment. it is the charter of the high court. a non -obstante clause of this nature can not cover the charter of the high court. mr. sharan next submits that section of the said act uses the words an appeal shall only lie. he submits that the words an appeal show that there can be only appeal to the high court. he submits that the use of the word only indicates that the legislature intended that there should be only appeal in the high court. mr. sharan submits that section also provides that from such an appeal an appeal shall lie to the supreme court. he submits that this makes it clear that section provides for only appeal to the high court and then an appeal to the supreme court. he submits that on a plain reading of section it is clear that a letters patent appeal would not lie against a judgment passed by a single judge of the high court in an appeal under section. on the other hand mr. mathur has submitted that a letters patent appeal would lie. he points out that almost all high courts have taken the view that a letters patent appeal would lie against a judgment of a single judge passed in an appeal filed under section of the said act. he relies upon the cases of $$$ v. $$$ reported in manu / de/006/1995manu / de/006/1995 air1995delhi29 $$$ v. crown reported in air lah narayandas daga v. ganpatrao reported in manu / na/0048/194manu / na/0048/194 and m. srinivas v. $$$ technological university hyderabad reported in an l t. in our view mr. mathur is right. section of the said act provides that every award shall be a decree and the statement of grounds of every award shall be a judgment. by virtue of the letters patent an appeal against the judgment of a single judge of the high court would lie to a division bench. section of the said act does not exclude an appeal under the letter patent. the word only occurring immediately after the non -obstante clause in section refers to the forum of appeal. in other words it provides that the appeal will be to the high court and not any other court e.g. the district court. the term an appeal does not restrict it to only appeal in the high court. the term an appeal would take within its sweep even a letters patent appeal. the decision of the division bench rendered in a letters patent appeal will then be subject to appeal to the supreme court. read in any other manner there would be a conflict between section and the provision of a letters patent. it is settled law that if there is a conflict attempt should be made to harmoniously construe the provisions. we therefore hold that under section of the said act there is no bar to the maintainability of a letters patent appeal. we therefore agree with the view taken in basant kumar 's case. the reference is answered accordingly. the case be now placed before a division bench for consideration of the other aspects.
