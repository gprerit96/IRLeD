disintegration of ussr their admissions ran into difficulties either not having studied in recognised colleges or partly in recognised and partly in non -recognised colleges or they had not completed their courses in full. the medical council of india for short mci also entertained serious doubts as to the genuineness of some courses underg by various students thus leading to difficulties on the question of recognising their degrees and their registration as medical practitirs. mci took the stand that when their initial admission in non -recognised institution could not be accepted their transfer to recognised colleges subsequently can not be of any benefit. mci also passed various types of orders either during the pendency of the proceedings before the courts or otherwise in relation to recognition of the degrees or registration of such persons as practitirs. the delhi high court allowed those writ petitions and granted reliefs to the concerned doctors which orders stood affirmed
