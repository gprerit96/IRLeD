$$$ j. leave granted in the special leave petitions. having perused the judgment of my esteemed brother for whom i have the deepest respect i am unable to concur with the view expressed by him. hence i pen a separate opinion. in this batch of appeals the issue that really arose before the different high courts is whether the tribunal was justified in holding that section -of the income -tax act mandates that the amount of profits allowed as deduction under section -of the act has to be reduced from the profits of the business of the undertaking while computing deduction under any another provisions under heading c in $$$ vi -a of the income -tax act. be it stated i have taken the said question from the judgment of the high court of bombay in associated capsules private limited v. deputy commissir of income tax and $$$. $$$ / mh/000/$$$$$$$ / mh/000/$$$$ itr bom and the said judgment has been placed reliance upon by the high court of bombay in the appeal arising out of special leave petition civil no. of. the high court allowing the appeal of the assessee did not agree with the view of the high court of delhi and opined thus we find it difficult to subscribe to the views expressed by the delhi high court in interpreting the provisions of section -. in that case in fact the counsel for the revenue had argued see para of the judgment that section -applies at the stage of allowing deduction and not at the stage of computing deduction under other provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a. it was argued that in the matter of grant of deduction the stage is computation of deduction and the stage is the allowance of the deduction. computation of deduction has to be made as provided in the respective sections and it is only at the stage of allowing deduction under section -and also under other provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a the provisions of section -come into operation. while accepting the arguments advanced by the counsel for the revenue it appears that the delhi high court failed to consider the important argument of the revenue noted in paragraph of its judgment. moreover without rejecting the argument of the revenue that section -applies at the stage of allowing the deduction and not at the stage of computing the deduction the delhi high court could not have held that section -seeks to disturb the method of computing the deduction provided under other provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a of the act. in these circumstances we find it difficult to concur with the views expressed by the delhi high court in the case of great eastern exports $$$ / $$$ / de//0 itr. for the same reason we find it difficult to subscribe to the views expressed by the kerala high court in the case of $$$ / ke/0/00$$$ / ke/0/00 itr.in the result we hold that section -does not affect the computability of deduction under various provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a but it affects the allowability of deductions computed under various provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a so that the aggregate deduction under section -a and other provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a do not exceed per cent of the profits of the business of the assessee. our above view is also supported by the central board of direct taxes circular no. dated december tr st.wherein it is stated that section -has been introduced with the view to prevent the taxpayers from claiming repeated deductions in respect of the same amount of eligible income and that too in excess of the eligible profits. thus the object of section -being not to curtail the deductions computable under various provisions under heading c of $$$ vi -a it is reasonable to hold that section -affects allowability of deduction and not computation of deduction. to illustrate if rs. is the profits of the business of the undertaking rs. is the profits allowed as deduction under section -and the deduction computed as per section is rs. then in view of section -the deduction under section would be restricted to rs. so that the aggregate deduction does not exceed the profits of the business. the high court of delhi in great eastern exports v. commissir of income -tax $$$ / $$$ / de//0 itr delhi while interpreting the said provision has applied the test of literal construction and observed are not in a position to subscribe to the contion of the learned counsel for the assessees that where the legislature inded to deduct the amount out of some other deduction a different phraseology was used as noticed above. this was sought to be demonstrated by refereeing to $$$ -section of section $$$ -section of section and $$$ -section of section 0e etc. which provisions start with the use of a non obstante clause. merely because section -b is not worded in a similar fashion that would not mean that we have to do violence to the plain language used in that provision which is capable of only meaning. a particular section of an enactment the intion of which is otherwise manifest can not be read by adopting such an insidious approach by referring to other sections. it is well known that the legislature adopts different ways and means in order to achieve its goal and there is no justification for insisce on identical language. likewise as rightly pointed out by the special bench of the tribunal the notice and objects of accompanying reasons are only an aid to construction. such aid to construction is needed when a literal reading of the provision leads to an ambiguous result or absurdity. to appreciate the controversy it is absolutely necessary to understand the scheme of the act and the purpose and the schematic impact of the provisions which are required to be interpreted in the context of $$$ in which they occur. the income tax act for short the act is arranged chapter -wise. $$$ i deals with preliminary definitions subject to the context in issue. $$$ ii gives contours of the charge for levy of income tax and ambit and scope of total income and certain other matters. $$$ iii relates to incomes which do not form part of the total income at all. $$$ iv relates to computation of total income under different sources i.sub heads which have been divided into parts a to f $$$ v deals with income of other persons which are to be included in the assessee 's total income. $$$ vi postulates aggregation of income from different sources or set off or carry forward of loss computed under different sources and to $$$$. $$$ via with which we are concerned deals with deductions to be made in computing total income. the said $$$ is divided into parts namely a to d. the said $$$ becomes operative on reaching the last stage of computation of income from different sources as per the provisions of $$$ i to vi. it is to be borne in mind that each chapter deals with independent subject matters at different stages. in other words before reaching the stage of invoking provisions of $$$ via the assessee is required to work out the gross total income by applying the provisions upto the stage of $$$ vi. it is in this context that in part a of $$$ via under the heading general it is postulated in $$$ -section to section that an assessee shall be allowed from his gross total income in accordance with and subject to the conditions of this $$$ the deductions specified in sections to. as per mandate of $$$ -section to section the aggregate amount of such deductions in $$$ via can not exceed the gross total income of the assessee. $$$ -section stipulates that where an assessee is an association of persons or body of individuals to whom specified deductions have been allowed then no deduction under the specified section shall be allowed in relation to share of such member of association of the persons or body of individuals. having stated the scheme as is reflective from the $$$ it is necessary to reproduce section ab which is relevant. it reads as follows deductions to be made with reference to the income included in the gross total income. where any deduction is required to be made or allowed under any section included in this $$$ under the heading c -deductions in respect of certain incomes in respect of any income of the nature specified in that section which is included in the gross total income of the assessee then notwithstanding anything contained in that section for the purpose of computing the deduction under that section the amount of income of that nature as computed in accordance with the provisions of this act before making any deduction under this $$$ shall al be deemed to be the amount of income of that nature which is derived or received by the assessee and which is included in his gross total income.the aforesaid section stipulates that notwithstanding anything contained in sections to for the purpose of computing deduction under the aforesaid section the amount of income of that nature as computed in accordance with the provisions of the act before making any deduction shall al be deemed to be the income derived or received by the assessee and included in his gross total income. the section a non -obstante provision overriding any section in part c and postulates that deduction under each section shall be separately computed in respect of income of that nature which is received or derived by the assessee and included in the gross total income. this provision is significant and accepts that an assessee may be entitled to multiple deductions under section to when conditions precedent stipulated in the section are satisfied. the expression ' gross total income has been defined in $$$ -section to section and it reads as under:80b. in $$$$ gross total income means the total income computed in accordance with the provisions of this act before making any deduction under this $$$;on a conjoint and harmonious reading of sections 80ab and it is apparent that once gross total income is computed in accordance with the provisions of the act but before making any deduction under the provisions of sections to. gross total income is computed by applying provisions upto $$$ vi without or before making any deduction under sections to but the quantum of income which qualifies for deduction under sections to would be amount of income of that nature derived or received by the assessee. as i perceive there is no difficulty to this ext. the difficulties arise when there are overriding provisions which d to control a deduction because deduction has been allowed in another provision. for example an assessee may be entitled to multiple deductions such as under section 80j which relates to deduction in respect of profits and gains from duly established industrial undertakings or ships or hotel business in certain cases under section which relates to deduction in respect of profits and gains derived from newly established industrial undertakings or hotel business in backward areas under section which relates to deduction in respect of profits and gains derived from exports outside india of goods and merchandise under section d which relates to deduction herein an assessee is engaged in the business of hotel or tour operator and has earning in convertible foreign exchange etc. thus when an assessee qualifies for deduction under separate sections which could be on percentage of profits or earnings controversy can arise. the contours or scope of $$$ via in such situations was noticed by this court in joint cit v. mandideep engineering and packaging industries private limited $$$ / sc/886/006$$$ / sc/886/006 itr sc and the following observations were made:. the point involved in the present case is whether sections and of the income -tax act are independent of each other and therefore a new industrial unit can claim deductions under both the sections on the gross total income independently or that deduction under section can be taken on the reduced balance after taking into account the benefit taken under section . the madhya pradesh high court in j.p. tobacco products p. ltd. v. cit reported in $$$ / mp/0/6$$$ / mp/0/6 itr took the view that both the sections are independent and therefore the deductions could be claimed both under sections and on the gross total income. against this judgment a special leave petition was filed in this court which was dismissed on the ground of delay on july see itr st. the decision in j.p. tobacco products p. ltd. $$$ / mp/0/6$$$ / mp/0/6 itr mp was followed by the same high court in the case of cit v. alpine solvex p. ltd. in i.t.a. no. of decided on may. special leave petition against this decision was dismissed by this court on january see itr st. this view has been followed repeatedly by different high courts in a number of cases against which no special leave petitions were filed meaning thereby that the department has accepted the view taken in these judgments. see cit v. nima specific family trust reported in $$$ / mh/0088/$$$$$$$ / mh/0088/$$$$ itr bom cit v. chokshi contacts p.

department has not filed the special leave petitions against the judgments of different high courts following the view taken by the madhya pradesh high court we do not find any merit in this appeal. the department having accepted the view taken in those judgments can not be permitted to take a contrary view in the present case involving the same point. accordingly the civil appeal is dismissed. no costs. for the purpose of clarity i would note that the court upheld the view taken by the madhya pradesh high court in j.b. tobacco products private limited v. cit manu / $$$ / mp/0/6 itr holding that no provision has been made in section 80i to provide for deduction of the gross total income computed as per the mandate of section read with section towards deduction allowed under section 80hh for the purpose of allowing deduction under section 80i. reference was made to $$$ -section of section as it then existed and was applicable before st april as it had made reference only to section. thus it was held that $$$ -section to section by itself meant that deduction allowed under section 80hh was to be reduced from the gross total income for granting benefit under section. therefore benefit under section 80i was to be granted on gross total income and not on the income reduced by the amount allowed under section 80hh. section 80hh and 80i operate independently and the deductions have to be allowed independently subject to the condition that total amount of deduction under $$$ via can not exceed the gross total income. in other words the gross total income on which deduction under section 80hh or 80i would be computed with reference to the gross total income without reducing from it deduction permitted under section 80hh or 80i or for that matter under any of the $$$ -sections under section or. it is beyond cavil that the aforesaid legal position continued to exist up to st march. with effect from st april amendments were made by inserting $$$ -section to section and $$$ -section to section 80ib. these provisions read as under:. where any amount of profits and gains of an undertaking or of an enterprise in the case of an assessee is claimed and allowed under this section for any $$$$ deduction to the ext of such profits and gains shall not be allowed under any other provisions of this $$$ under the heading c.-deductions in respect of certain incomes and shall in no case exceed the profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking or enterprise as the case may be. the provisions contained in $$$ -section and $$$ -sections to of section shall so far as may be apply to the eligible business under this section. in the present set of appeals i am dealing with the provisions after st april i.post amendment provisions and the question raised is whether deduction allowed under section is to be reduced from the gross profits while computing deduction under section. the controversy arises because the assessees herein are entitled to deduction both under section which is restricted to the stipulated percentage of profits and gains derived from specified business and under section again stipulated percentage of profits derived from exports of goods and merchandise are entitled for deduction. section specifically prescribes a formula or method for computing the said deduction in $$$ -section which at present reads as follows:. for the purposes of $$$ -section where the export out of india is of goods or merchandise manufactured or processed by the assessee the profits derived from such export shall be the amount which bears to the profits of the business the same proportion as the export turnover in respect of such goods bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee;(b where the export out of india is of trading goods the profits derived from such export shall be the export turnover in respect of such trading goods as reduced by the direct costs and indirect costs attributable to such export;(c where the export out of india is of goods or merchandise manufactured or processed by the assessee and of trading goods the profits derived from such export shall in respect of the goods or merchandise manufactured or processed by the assessee be the amount which bears to the adjusted profits of the business the same proportion as the adjusted export turnover in respect of such goods bears to the adjusted total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee $$$ in respect of trading goods be the export turnover in respect of such trading goods as reduced by the direct and indirect costs attributable to export of such trading goods $$$ that the profits computed under $$$ a or $$$ b or $$$ c of this $$$ -section shall be further increased by the amount which bears to per cent of any sum referred to in $$$ iiia not being profits on sale of licence acquired from any other person and $$$s iiib and iiic of section the same proportion as the export turnover bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee $$$ further that in the case of an assessee having export turnover not exceeding rupees crores during $$$$ the profits computed under $$$ a or $$$ b or $$$ c of this $$$ -section or after giving effect to the proviso as the case may be shall be further increased by the amount which bears to per cent of any sum referred to in $$$ iiid or $$$ iiie as the case may be of section the same proportion as the export turnover bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee $$$ also that in the case of an assessee having export turnover exceeding rupees crores during $$$$ the profits computed under $$$ a or $$$ b or $$$ c of this $$$ -section or after giving effect to the proviso as the case may be shall be further increased by the amount which bears to per cent of any sum referred to in $$$ iiid of section the same proportion as the export turnover bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee if the assessee has necessary and sufficient evidence to prove that he had an option to choose either the duty drawback or the duty entitlement pass book scheme being the duty remission scheme the rate of drawback credit attributable to the customs duty was higher than the rate of credit allowable under the duty entitlement pass book scheme being the duty remission scheme $$$ also that in the case of an assessee having export turnover exceeding rupees crores during $$$$ the profits computed under $$$ a or $$$ b or $$$ c of this $$$ -section or after giving effect to the proviso as the case may be shall be further increased by the amount which bears to per cent of any sum referred to in $$$ iiie of section the same proportion as the export turnover bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee if the assessee has necessary and sufficient evidence to prove that he had an option to choose either the duty drawback or the duty free replenishment certificate being the duty remission scheme the rate of drawback credit attributable to the customs duty was higher than the rate of credit allowable under the duty free replenishment certificate being the duty remission scheme.$$$. -for the purposes of this clause rate of credit allowable means the rate of credit allowable under the duty free replenishment certificate being the duty remission scheme calculated in the manner as may be notified by the central government $$$ also that in case the computation under $$$ a or $$$ b or $$$ c of this $$$ -section is a loss such loss shall be set off against the amount which bears to per cent of-(a any sum referred to in $$$ iiia or $$$ iiib or $$$ iiic as the case may be or(b any sum referred to in $$$ iiid or $$$ iiie as the case may be of section as applicable in the case of an assessee referred to in the or or the proviso as the case may be the same proportion as the export turnover bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee.$$$. -for the purposes of this $$$ -section adjusted export turnover means the export turnover as reduced by the export turnover in respect of trading goods;(b adjusted profits of the business means the profit of the business as reduced by the profits derived from the business of export out of india of trading goods as computed in the manner provided in $$$ b of $$$ -section adjusted total turnover means the total turnover of the business as reduced by the export turnover in respect of trading goods;(d direct costs means costs directly attributable to the trading goods exported out of india including the purchase price of such goods;(e indirect costs means costs not being direct costs allocated in the ratio of the export turnover in respect of trading goods to the total turnover;(f trading goods means goods which are not manufactured or processed by the assessee. as is manifest deduction under $$$ -section a is computed by ascertaining eligible profits which is the profits of business in the same proportion as the export turnover in respect of such goods bears to the total turnover of business. a separate formula is prescribed under $$$ b of $$$ -section to section in case of a trader exporter and under $$$ c in respect of an assessee who is both a manufacturer / processor and a trader exporter. the section is a detailed and provides complete method and mechanism to compute deduction under section. it is in the context of section that $$$ -section to section 80i has come up for interpretation. there is no dispute that $$$ -section to section 80i would be applicable as the assessee would be entitled to deduction under section as well as under section. the contention of the revenue is that the said $$$ -section mandates that deduction under section has to be computed not only on the profits of business as reduced by the amounts specified in $$$ baa and $$$ -section of section but by also reducing the amount of profit and gains allowed as a deduction under section of the act. in other words the gross total income eligible for deduction under section would be less or reduced by the deduction already allowed under section. thus the gross total income eligible for deduction would not be the gross total income as defined in $$$ -section to section read with section but would be the gross total income computed under $$$ -section to section read with section less the deduction under section. an example will make position clear. supposing an assessee has gross total income of rs. and is entitled to deduction under sections and and the deduction under section is rs. then the gross total income of which deduction under section is to be computed would be rs. and not rs.. on the other hand the case of the assessee is that the gross total income would not undergo a change or reduction for the purpose of section the deductions will be computed separately without the deduction allowed under section being reduced from the gross total income for computing the deduction under section. the reason being that $$$ -section to section does not affect computation of deduction under section but postulates that the deduction computed under section so aggregated with the deduction under section does not exceed the profits of the business. the high court of bombay in the case of associated capsules private ltd. supra has accepted the contention of the assessee observing and recording the following reasons:. section consists of parts part where any amount of profits and gains of an undertaking / enterprise is claimed and allowed under section for any $$$$ part deduction to the extent of profits and gains allowed under section shall not be allowed under any other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a of the act and part in no case the deduction allowed shall exceed the profits and gains of the business of undertaking / enterprise. the dispute in the present case is whether the part of section seeks to disturb the mechanism of computing the deduction provided under section of the act the part of section provided that the deduction to the extent of profits allowed under section shall not be allowed under any other provisions. it obviously means that the deductions that are allowable under other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a would be allowed to the extent of profits as reduced by the profits allowed under section. the part of section does not even remotely refer to the method of computing deduction under other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a. thus section seeks to curtail allowance of deduction and not computability of deduction under any other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a of the act. how to compute deduction allowable under section is set out in section. in the case of a manufacturer -exporter section provides that the deduction under section has to be computed as per the formula:. $$$ baa in section defines the term profits of the business for the purposes of section to mean the profits of the business as computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession as reduced by the amounts specified therein. therefore in the case of a manufacturer -exporter deduction under section is statutorily required to be computed on the profits of the business as reduced by the amounts specified in $$$ baa of section. unless it is specifically provided by the statute the profits of the business for the purpose of section can not be reduced by any amount save and except the amount specified in $$$ baa of section itself. section of the act does not expressly or impliedly provide that the amount of profits allowed as deduction under section should be reduced from the profits of the business for the purpose of computing deduction under section or computing deduction under any other provisions in heading c of chapter vi -a and therefore the contention of the revenue to that effect can not be accepted. in the case of a trade -exporter section provides that the deduction under section has to be computed on the export turnover reduced by the direct costs and indirect costs attributable to the goods or merchandise exported by the assessee. the argument of the revenue that under section the amount of profits allowed under section has to be deducted from the profits of business while computing deduction under section is accepted then the section becomes unworkable because in the case of a trader -exporter the deduction under section is computed on the exporter turnover and not on the profits of the business. the words export turnover and profits of business are separately defined under section. therefore in the case of a trader -exporter section can be applied only after the deduction under section is computed. similarly in the case of a manufacturer / processor -exporter section would be applicable while allowing the deduction computed under section of the act. if the words used in section were shall not qualify then probably it could be said that the legislature intended to affect the quantum of deductions computable under other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a because the amount that qualifies for deduction al forms the basis for computing the deduction. the word qualify is an expression relatable to the computation of deduction. the word allowed is relatable to allowing the deduction that is computed. the word allowed can not be equated with the word qualify. since section uses the words shall not be allowed in our opinion the section seeks to restrict the allowance of deduction and not the computation of deduction under any other sections under heading c of chapter vi -a of the act. wherever the legislature intended that the deduction allowed under section should affect the computation of deduction under other provisions of the act the legislature has expressly used words to that effect. it may be noted that sections and presently were introduced by finance no. act with effect from april. section provides that the deduction allowed under section 80hhd shall not qualify to that extent for deduction under any other provisions of chapter vi -a under the heading c whereas section provides that the deduction allowed under section shall not be allowed under any other provisions of chapter vi -a under heading c. similarly in section the words used are that notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of the act in computing the total income of the assessee no deduction shall be allowed under any other section contained in chapter vi -a or section or section in relation to the profits and gains of the undertaking. thus the legislature has used specific words whenever it intended to affect the computation of deduction. as the words used in section relate to allowance and not computation of deduction it can not be inferred that section is inserted with a view to affect computation of deduction under any other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a. it is well established in law that the language of the statute must be read as it is and the statute must not be read by adding or substituting the words unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. since section uses the words shall not be allowed it is not permissible to read section by substituting the above words with the words shall not qualify or by adding the words shall not be allowed in computing the deduction under any other provisions under heading c of chapter vi -a of the act. when the plain and simple meaning of section can be ascertained from the words used in the section it would not be proper to construe the section by substituting or adding the words as suggested by the revenue. delhi high court on the other hand in great eastern exports v. commissir of income -tax manu / $$$ / de/6/0 itr delhi has held as under:. the expressions in these provisions are very crucial which are deduction to the extent of such profits and the word and occurring therein. the expression very clearly signifies that if an assesses is claiming benefit of deduction of a particular amount of profits and gains under section to that extent profits and gains are to be reduced while calculating the deduction under the heading c of chapter vi -a of the act. further the word and is disjunctive which would mean that the other provision is independent of the namely total deductions should not exceed the profits and gains in $$$$. even a layman who has some proficiency in english would understand the meaning of this provision in the manner we have explained above. it would therefore be clear that this provision aims at achieving independent objectives delineated above. it can not be limited to the objective al thereby annihilating the altogether and making it otiose. if we accept the contention of learned counsel for the assesses it would lead to this result which has to be avoided. $$$ on interpretation is clear. if the language of the statute is plain and capable of and only meaning that obvious meaning is to be given to the said provision. rules of interpretation are applied only if there are ambiguities when the purpose of interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the law i.mens legis it is based on assertion by adopting plain meaning of the statute in the absence of any ambiguity. the aforesaid judgment gives the stamp of approval to the opinion expressed by the special bench of the tribunal in assistant commissir of income -tax v. $$$ garments itr at chennai wherein it has been observed that several sections like and provide for modification or change of manner and mode of computation or preferential treatment of deduction over the other. these sections have to be read harmoniously. though section 80ab starts with the non -obstante clause the provisions of section a to section would override. the delhi high court has accepted the said interpretation and observed that the provisions are required to be read harmoniously for section should not be treated as a redundant provision as it was introduced for the purpose of achieving a clear objective. consequently it has held that the deduction under section can not be computed without reference to the bar under section. there is no doubt that section 80ab and $$$ -section to section have to be harmoniously construed and read together. there can not be any trace of doubt that the limb of section to section has been enacted to prevent cascading effect of deductions under section and. there was already a cap or the upper limit stipulated in $$$ -section to section that the deductions can not exceed the gross total income of the assessee. however section to section stipulates that in no case deduction shall exceed profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking and enterprise. the said provision does not make a reference to the gross total income but it refers to the profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking and enterprise. thus read it can not be said that the last part of $$$ -section to section would be rendered meaningless being a mere reproduction of $$$ -section to section. the provisions operate independently. the aforesaid aspect has been overlooked by the delhi high court while emphasizing that the word and is disjunctive. there can not be any doubt that the last part of section has its meaning and object but it is not necessary to read the same to curtail or reduce profit or gains of business by the deduction allowed under section. this aspect is highlighted in associated capsules private limited supra by the high court of bombay in the following paragraphs:. as per section in part a of chapter vi -a the aggregate amount of deduction allowed under chapter vi -a shall not exceed the gross total income. thus the overall deduction allowed under chapter vi -a can not exceed the gross total income. however on noticing that several undertakings were availing of deductions under chapter vi -a within the overall limit of gross total income but exceeding the profits of the undertaking the legislature introduced $$$ -section a in section by the finance no. act with effect from april. by the finance act section has been renumbered as section. the object of amending section by the finance no. act as is evident from the memorandum explaining the provisions in the finance no. $$$ itr st.is that it was noticed that certain assessees were claiming more than percent deduction on the profits and gains of the same undertaking when they were entitled to deductions under more than section under heading c of chapter vi -a. with a view to prevent the taxpayer taking undue advantage of the existing provisions of the act section was amended by the finance no. act so that the deductions allowed under section and various sections under heading c of chapter vi -a are restricted to the profits of the business of the undertakings / enterprise. the part of $$$ -section to section refers to the computation of profits and gains of an undertaking or enterprise allowed under section in any $$$$ and the amount so calculated shall not be allowed as a deduction under any other provisions of this chapter. it is in this context that the bombay high court has rightly pointed out that there is a difference between allowing a deduction and computation of deduction. the have separate and distinct meanings. computation of deduction is a stage prior and helps in quantifying the amount which is eligible for deduction. $$$ -section to section does not bar or prohibit the deduction allowed under section from being included in the gross total income when deduction under section of the act is computed. in this context it has been held that the expression shall not be allowed can not be equated with the words shall not qualify or shall not be allowed in computing deduction. the effect thereof would be that while computing deduction under section the gross total income would mean the gross total income before allowing any deduction under section or other sections of part c of chapter via of the act. but once the deduction under section has been calculated it will be allowed ensuring that the deduction under section and when aggregated do not exceed profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking and enterprise. as i find the legislature has used the expression shall not qualify in section and but the said expression has not been used in $$$ -section to section. the formula prescribed in $$$ -section to section is a complete code for the purpose of the said computation of eligible profits and gains of business from exports of mercantiles and goods. it has reference to total turnover turnover from exports in proportion to profits and gains from business in $$$ a and so forth under $$$ b and of section of the act. in case the gross total income is reduced or modified taking into account the deduction allowed under section it would lead to absurd and unintended consequences. it would render the formula under $$$ -section to section ineffective and unworkable as highlighted in paragraph of the decision in associated capsules private limited supra with reference to $$$ of section. even when i apply $$$ a and calculate eligible deduction under section it would give an odd and anomalous figure. to illustrate i would like to expound on the earlier example after recording that the gross total income of rs. was on assumed total turnover of rs. which includes export turnover of rs. and the deduction allowable under section was % and the deduction allowable under section was % of the eligible profits as computed under section. the stand of the revenue is that without alteration or modification of the figures of total turnover and the export turnover the gross total income would undergo a reduction from rs. to rs. as rs. has been allowed as a deduction under section. this would result in anomaly for the said figure would not be the actual and true figure or the true gross total income or profit earned on the total turnover including export turnover and therefore would give a somewhat unusual and unacceptable result. there is no logic or rationale for making the calculation in the said impracticable and unintelligible manner. recently this court in jeyar consultant and investment private limited v. commissir of income tax madras manu / sc/08/$$$$manu / sc/08/$$$$ scc dealing with the assessment year -had examined $$$ -section )(b to section as it then existed on the question of computation of deduction which has reference to figures of profit from business export turnover and total turnover. the said clause applied to assessee who had turnover and income from business in india as well as from export business. the eligible profits from exports under the clause were computed as a proportion which had reference to the figures. reversing the finding of the high court it was observed that insofar export business was concerned the assessee therein had admittedly incurred loses and on the said factual position there was no doubt or debate. however the assessee relying upon the formula prescribed in clause b to section had contended that profits of business as a whole i.profits earned from goods or merchandise within india which outweighed the loses from exports should be taken into consideration. referring to the decisions in ipca laboratories limited v. cit manu / sc/09/$$$$manu / sc/09/$$$$ scc and a.m. $$$ v. cit manu / sc/69/$$$$manu / sc/69/$$$$ scc the contention was rejected observing that the profits of business should be positive profits and not negative income or losses. it was observed that the formula prescribed in $$$ -section clause b would not come into the picture where it was an accepted case of the assessee that there were no profits from export business. hence when there were loses in export business deduction under section would not be allowed. the issue raised in the present case is entirely different. the assessee has made profits which are eligible and on which deduction is to be allowed under sections and. other aspects need to be noticed. in jeyar consultant and investment private limited supra the court was dealing with the assessment year -and $$$ -section to section as it then existed and was applicable. the said $$$ -section had underwent substitution by finance no. act with effect from st april and then again by finance no. act with effect from st april. the substitution may not be of material relevance for it was specified that the profits derived from exports were to be worked out in the same proportion with the sale proceeds received in or brought into india in convertible foreign exchange bear to the total sale proceeds of such goods or merchandise. however the amendments made by finance no. act with effect from assessment year -are substantial as the new provisions provides a detailed mechanism for computing profits from exports from trading goods and in case of mixed activity of manufacturing and trading. $$$ -section to section as enacted by the finance no. act and further amendments has been quoted in paragraph above. it may be noted that the  and provisos to section were inserted by $$$ amendment act with retrospective effect from st $$$. the proviso was inserted by $$$ amendment act with retrospective effect from st april. $$$ to $$$ -section would indicate that it defines different terms including direct and indirect cost trading goods adjusted export turnover and adjusted profits of the business. finance no. act with retrospective effect from st april in the $$$ to the section defines the term total turnover and profits of business in $$$

business as defined in clause baa of the $$$ to section of the act was interpreted by the court in acg associated capsules private limited v. commissir of income tax central -iv mumbai manu / sc/000/$$$$manu / sc/000/$$$$ scc in the following $$$$. before we deal with the contentions of the learned counsel for the parties we may extract $$$ baa to section 80-hhc of the act $$$.the purposes of this section,-- baa ' profits of the business means the profits of the business as computed under the head ' profits and gains of business or profession as reduced by-( per cent of any sum referred to in $$$ -a iii -b iii -c iii -d and iii -e of section or of any receipts by way of brokerage commission interest rent charges or any other receipt of a similar nature included in such profits and( the profits of any branch office warehouse or any other establishment of the assessee situate outside. $$$ baa extracted above states that profits of the business means the profits of the business as computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession as reduced by the receipts of the nature mentid in $$$ and of $$$ baa. thus profits of the business of an assessee will have to be computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession in accordance with the provisions of sections to of the act. in the computation of such profits of business all receipts of income which are chargeable as profits and gains of business under section of the act will have to be included. similarly in computation of such profits of business different expenses which are allowable under sections to have to be allowed as expenses. after including such receipts of income and after deducting such expenses the total of the net receipts are profits of the business of the assessee computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession from which deductions are to be made under $$$ and of $$$ baa. reliance was placed for the said interpretation on a decision of the constitution bench in distributors baroda p limited v. union of india manu / sc/0/98manu / sc/0/98 scc to observe:6. similarly $$$ baa has to be construed on its own language and as per the plain natural meaning of the words used in $$$ baa the words receipts by way of brokerage commission interest rent charges or any other receipt of a similar nature included in such profits will not only refer to the nature of receipts but also the quantum of receipts included in the profits of the business as computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession referred to in the part of the $$$ baa. accordingly if any quantum of any receipt of the nature mentid in clause of $$$ baa has not been included in the profits of business of an assessee as computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession per cent of such quantum of the receipt can not be deducted under $$$ baa to section. if we now apply $$$ baa as interpreted by us in this judgment to the facts of the case before us if the rent or interest is a receipt chargeable as profits and gains of business and chargeable to tax under section of the act and if any quantum of the rent or interest of the assesses is allowable as an expense in accordance with sections to of the act and is not to be included in the profits of the business of the assessee as computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession per cent of such quantum of the receipt of rent or interest will not be deducted under clause of $$$ baa to section hhc. in other words per cent of not the gross rent or gross interest but only the net interest or net rent which has been included in the profits of business of the assessee as computed under the head profits and gains of business or profession is to be deducted under clause of $$$ baa to section for determining the profits of the business. referring to cit v. k. ravindranathan nair manu / sc//$$$$manu / sc//$$$$ scc it was observed that processing charges received by the assessee were held to be business turnover and included in profits and gains of business. as per explanation baa it was observed that % of this income would have to be deducted. however in ravindranathan nair supra the court was not deciding whether % of the deduction was to be made from gross or net income. earlier decision in $$$ v. cit manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ scc holds that not the entire amount on sale of depb but the sale value less the face value will represent profit under section iii -d and accordingly deduction under section should be computed. the aspect to be noticed is that in jeyar consultant and investment private limited supra reference was made to ipca laboratories limited supra and a.m. $$$ supra and it was noticed that in the said cases the court was concerned with business activities both of which related to exports from export of self manufactured / processed goods and other from trading in goods. in other words the court was concerned only with income from exports and there was no domestic or in india turnover. in view of the aforesaid analysis i am of the considered opinion that the interpretation placed by the high court of bombay is correct and accordingly i dismiss the appeals preferred by the revenue and allow the appeals preferred by the assessees. there shall be no order as to costs.anil r. $$$ j. leave granted in all the special leave petitions. these are several appeals which involve the same issue as in civil appeal no. of and therefore all the appeals have been heard together at the request of the learned counsel appearing for both the sides but for the purpose of deciding all these appeals i have considered facts of c.a. no. of which are as under:6. being aggrieved by the judgment delivered in ita of dated th july by the high court of karnataka at bangalore this appeal has been filed by the assistant commissioner of income tax bangalore. the appellant has been referred to hereinafter as the revenue whereas the respondent m / s. micro labs ltd. has been referred to as the assessee. the assessee was aggrieved by the order dated th january passed in ita no. by the income tax appellate tribunal bangalore bench and had therefore approached the high court of karnataka at bangalore. the high court allowed the appeal and therefore the revenue has filed this appeal. the question which had to be considered by the tribunal as well as by the high court was whether while considering the deduction under the provisions of section or / and of the income tax act hereinafter referred to as the act the assessee is also entitled to the deduction in respect of the profits and gains under the provisions of section of the act or whether the assessee is entitled to deductions under the aforestated all the sections in respect of the same profits. upon perusal of the aforestated sections and looking at the facts of the case the tribunal had come to the conclusion that the assessee was not entitled to deductions under sections and of the act but the high court did not agree with the said conclusion arrived at by the tribunal and decided in favour of the assessee to the effect that though the assessee had claimed and was allowed deductions under section of the act the assessee was also entitled to deductions under the provisions of section of the act in respect of the same profits. thus in this appeal what is to be considered is whether the assessee was entitled to the deductions claimed by it under the aforestated sections as decided by the high court in favour of the assessee. the case of the revenue is that looking at the provisions of the aforestated sections the assessee is not entitled to the deductions under all the aforestated sections of the act. on the aforestated subject different views have been taken by different high courts and therefore this appeal had been admitted. the high court of bombay has decided cases in favour of the assessee whereas a different view has been taken by the high court of delhi. for the purpose of better understanding of the issue relevant extracts of the said sections of the act have been reproduced hereinbelow: deduction in respect of profits and gains from certain industrial undertakings other than infrastructure development undertakings. -where the gross total income of an assessee includes any profits and gains derived from any business referred to in $$$ -sections to a and such business being hereinafter referred to as the eligible business there shall in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the section be allowed in computing the total income of the assessee a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to such percentage and for such number of $$$$ as specified in this section.to xxx xxx the provisions contained in $$$ -section and $$$ -section to of section shall so far as may be apply to the eligible business under this section. deductions in respect of profits and gains from industrial undertakings or enterprises engaged in infrastructure development etc. to xxx xxx xxx(9 where any amount of profits and gains of an undertaking or of an enterprise in the case of an assessee is claimed and allowed under this section for any $$$$ deduction to the extent of such profits and gains shall not be allowed under any other provisions of this chapter under the heading c.-deductions in respect of certain incomes and shall in no case exceed the profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking or enterprise as the case may be. deduction in respect of profits retained for export business.where an assessee being an indian company or a person other than a company resident in india is engaged in the business of export out of india of any goods or merchandise to which this section applies there shall in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section be allowed in computing the total income of the assessee a deduction to the extent of profits referred to in $$$ -section derived by the assessee from the export of such goods or merchandise provided that if the assessee being a holder of an export house certificate or a trading house certificate hereafter in this section referred to as an export house or a trading house as the case may be issues a certificate referred to in clause b of $$$ -section 4a that in respect of the amount of the export turnover specified therein the deduction under this $$$ -section is to be allowed to a supporting manufacturer then the amount of deduction in the case of the assessee shall be reduced by such amount which bears to the total profits derived by the assessee from the export of trading goods the same proportion as the amount of export turnover specified in the said certificate bears to the total export turnover of the assessee in respect of such trading goods.a xxx xxx $$$ for the purposes of sub -sections and a the extent of deduction of the profits shall be an amount equal to per cent thereof for $$$$ beginning on the st day of april per cent thereof for $$$$ beginning on the st day of april per cent thereof for $$$$ beginning on the st day of april per cent thereof for $$$$ beginning on the st day of april no deduction shall be allowed in respect of $$$$ beginning on the st day of april and any subsequent $$$$. so far as civil appeal no. of is concerned which is against the judgment delivered by the high court of karnataka at bangalore as stated hereinabove the same has been decided in favour of the assessee and in the circumstances the revenue has preferred the present appeal as it has been aggrieved by the way in which the deductions were permitted by the high court from the same profits and gains of the business to the assessee under sections and of the act. according to the case of the revenue the tribunal was right in deciding the case of the assessee and the high court committed an error while interpreting the legal provisions of the sections referred to hereinabove. the learned counsel appearing for the revenue had submitted that the intention behind enactment of the aforestated sections of the act was to see that no assessee gets deductions twice under the provisions of the aforestated sections. in nutshell the submission on behalf of the revenue was that having once obtained deduction under the provisions of sections or / and of the act no assessee can then avail deductions under section of the act in respect of the same profits. it had been specifically stated on behalf of the revenue that section of the act had been amended with effect from 1st april so as to see that the total deduction does not exceed total profits and gains of the business and in respect of the same profits deductions under section and sections or 80-ib together can not be allowed. the learned counsel appearing for the revenue had read and tried to interpret each of the aforestated sections and specifically put his emphasis on that part of the section which prevents the assessee from taking advantage of having deductions from both of the sections referred to hereinabove. section according to the learned counsel appearing for the revenue deals with the deductions which can be availed by the assessee who is engaged in the business of export out of india of any goods or merchandise to which the said section applies. the said section deals with the manner in which the deduction can be claimed by the assessee. so far as section is concerned it pertains to deductions in respect of profits and gains from industrial undertakings or enterprises engaged in the business of infrastructure development. section of the act specifically provides that when any deduction is claimed and allowed under the provisions of section of the act deduction to the extent of such profits and gains can not be allowed under any other provisions under heading c. -deductions in respect of certain incomes of the chapter in which section has been included. similarly it had been submitted by the learned counsel that so far as section 80-ib is concerned it pertains to deduction in respect of profits and gains from certain industrial undertakings other than the business of infrastructure development. he had further submitted that section also provides that certain provisions of section would also apply to section like the provisions of sub -section and sub -sections to of section. the learned counsel had thus submitted that by virtue of the provisions of section the provisions applicable to industrial undertakings to whom deductions under section are granted would also apply to certain extent. by virtue of the aforestated provisions of section provisions of section would also apply to the industrial units who claim benefit of deduction under section of the act. according to the learned counsel section is clear to the effect that once a deduction is claimed under section no deduction can be claimed under heading c of chapter via. section is included in heading c of chapter via and therefore if an assessee claims and is allowed deduction under section or section he can not be allowed any deduction under section or any other section that falls under heading c of chapter via of the act. now let us look at the case with which we are concerned. the assessee in the main appeal is having several industrial units having different activities or different businesses. the assessee being also in the business of export had also claimed and was allowed deduction under section. in spite of the fact that the assessee had claimed deduction in respect of the provisions of section 80-ib the assessee had also claimed deduction under section with respect to the same profits. the $$$ officer had allowed deductions under section without considering the fact that the assessee had also claimed and was allowed deduction under the provisions of section 80-ib. in the aforestated circumstances the commissioner of income -tax exercising his power under section of the act vide order dated 26th february observed that the $$$ officer was not correct in allowing deductions under section 80-ib as well as under section and therefore directed the $$$ officer to revise the assessment order. the said order passed by the commissioner of income -tax had been challenged by the assessee before the tribunal and the tribunal was pleased to dismiss the appeal and therefore the assessee had filed an appeal before the high court which has been allowed. being aggrieved the revenue has filed this appeal. on the other hand the learned counsel appearing for the assessee in civil appeal no. of and other connected appeals had submitted that the view expressed by the high court is absolutely correct. according to the learned counsel the statute wants to give deduction to the assessee in respect of both the activities namely in respect of export of goods as well as with respect to infrastructure development etc. and as the assesses in all the cases are engaged in the business of export as well as in the business of infrastructure development etc.the assesses are entitled to claim deductions in respect of export business as well as infrastructure development activities etc. according to the learned counsel if there is any confusion or any ambiguity in the tax law benefit thereof should be given to the assessee and the high court of karnataka and some other high courts in the country had rightly permitted the assesses to claim deductions under both the sections. thus the counsel appearing for the assesses had supported the reasons given by the high court and had submitted that the appeals filed by the revenue deserve dismissal. i have heard the learned counsel and considered the judgments referred to by them and the provisions of the act concerning the subject of the appeals. upon perusal of the sections referred to hereinabove and the judgments discussed during the course of the hearing i am of the view that the high court of karnataka is not right when it decided to allow deductions in respect of same profits under section 80hhc as well as under section or section 80-ib.  can very well see from the provisions of section that if an assessee is engaged in infrastructure development as well as in the export business he can not claim deduction of his entire profits and gains under the provisions of section 80hhc as well as under section or / and section of the act. section is quite unambiguous which clearly provides that if an assessee claims any deduction under the provisions of section then the assessee can not claim deduction to the extent of such profits and gains under heading c of chapter via of the act which in the present case was claimed and wrongly allowed to the assessee. section which pertains to deduction in respect of profits and gains from export business is included under heading c of chapter via of the act. if an assessee claims and is allowed any deduction under section then to the extent to which deduction has been granted to him under section or / and 80-ib he can not be allowed further deduction under section. the language is not only very clear but is also absolutely unambiguous as it says where any amount of profits and gains of an undertaking or of an enterprise in the case of an assessee is claimed and allowed under this section for any assessment year deduction to the extent of such profits and gains shall not be allowed under any other provisions of this chapter under the heading c. -deductions in respect of certain incomes and shall in no case exceed the profits and gains of such eligible business of undertaking or enterprise as the case may be. admittedly the assessing officer had allowed deductions not only under section but also under section in respect of the entire profits and gains of the business of the assessee. in the opinion of the commissioner it was not proper and therefore he had taken the matter in revision under section of the act. he ultimately directed the assessing officer to re -assess the income in the light of the observations made in the order passed under section of the act and the said order passed by the commissioner had also been confirmed by the tribunal. however the order of the tribunal when challenged before the high court was quashed and set aside. in the instant case i also find that the intention of the legislature is very clear to the effect that if an assessee claims any deduction under the provisions of sections or / and 80-ib he can not claim deduction to the extent to such profits and gains which had been claimed and allowed under the provisions of section of the act because section is included in heading c of chapter via of the act. in my opinion the high court was in error while permitting the assessee to get benefit in respect of section 80hhc as it did not take into account the fact that the profits in respect of which deduction was allowed under section had also been previously allowed under section 80-ib. in my opinion this is not permissible under section read with section because by virtue of section provisions of section are also applicable to section 80-ib. for the aforestated reasons i am not in agreement with the view expressed by the high court and therefore i decide the appeals in favour of the revenue by holding that the assessee who had claimed and had been allowed deductions in respect of profits under section could not have been allowed deductions in respect of the same profits under section of the act. other issues though referred to in the memo of appeals had not been pressed seriously and therefore i am not deciding the same by keeping the said issues open. the appeals thus stand disposed of as allowed in favour of the revenue with no order as to costs. in view of difference of opinion the matters are referred to a larger bench. the registry is directed to place the matters before the $$$ the chief justice of india so that the same can be referred to an appropriate bench.
