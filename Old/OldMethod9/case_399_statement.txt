evidence by obtaining--(a)(i the matriculation or equivalent certificates if available and in the absence whereof;(ii the date of birth certificate from the school other than a play school attended

rule shall also apply to those disposed of cases where the status of juvenility has not been determined in accordance with the provisions contained in sub -rule and the act requiring dispensation of the sentence under the act for passing appropriate order in the interest of the juvenile in conflict with law. the above provisions clearly show that even if a person was not entitled to the benefit of juvenilities under the act or the present act prior to its amendment in such benefit is available to a person undergoing sentence if he was below on the date of the occurrence. such relief can be claimed even if a matter has been finally decided as in the present case. in hari ram v. state of rajasthan and anr. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc it was observed:$$$$. the effect of the proviso to section introduced by the amending act makes it clear that the claim of juvenility may be raised before any court which shall be recognised at any stage even after final disposal of the case and such claim shall be determined in terms of the provisions contained in the act and the rules made thereunder which includes the definition of juvenile in sections and of the act even if the juvenile had ceased to be so on or before the date of commencement of the act.emphasis supplied)0. the said intention of the legislature was reinforced by the amendment effected by the said amending act to section by introduction of the proviso and the $$$ thereto wherein also it has been clearly indicated that in any pending case in any court the determination of juvenility of such a juvenile has to be in terms of section even if the juvenile ceases to be so on or before the date of commencement of this act and it was also indicated that the provisions of the act would apply as if the said provisions had been in force for all purposes and at all material times when the alleged offence was committed.emphasis supplied). apart from the aforesaid provisions of the act as amended and the juvenile justice rules rule thereof has to be read in tandem with section of the juvenile justice act as amended by the amendment act which provides that even in disposed of cases of juveniles in conflict with law the state government or the board could either suo motu or on an application made for the purpose review the case of a juvenile determine the juvenility and pass an appropriate order under section of the act for the immediate release of the juvenile whose period of detention had exceeded the maximum period provided in section of the act i. years. in addition to the above section of the juvenile justice act is also of relevance and is reproduced hereinbelow:$$$$. presumption and determination of age.where it appears to a competent authority that person brought before it under any of the provisions of this act otherwise than for the purpose of giving evidence is a juvenile or the child the competent authority shall make due inquiry so as to the age of that person and for that purpose shall take such evidence as may be necessary but not an affidavit and shall record a finding whether the person is a juvenile or the child or not stating his age as nearly as may be.no order of a competent authority shall be deemed to have become invalid merely by any subsequent proof that the person in respect of whom the order has been made is not a juvenile or the child and the age recorded by the competent authority to be the age of person so brought before it shall for the purpose of this act be deemed to be the true age of that person. sub -section of section vests the competent authority with the power to make due inquiry as to the age of a person brought before it and for the said purpose to take such evidence as may be necessary but not an affidavit and shall record a finding as to whether the person is a juvenile or a child or not stating his age as nearly as may be. sub -section of section is of equal importance as it provides that no order of a competent authority would be deemed to have become invalid merely on account of any subsequent proof that the person in respect of whom an order is made is not a juvenile or a child and the age recorded by the competent authority to be the age of the person brought before it would for the purpose of the act be deemed to be the true age of a child or a juvenile in conflict with law. sub -rule of rule indicates that the age determination inquiry by the court or board by seeking evidence is to be derived from:(i the matriculation or equivalent certificates if available and in the absence of the same;(ii the date of birth certificate from the school other than a play school attended and in the absence whereof;(iii the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat;. clause of rule provides that only in the absence of any such document would a medical opinion be sought for from a duly constituted medical board which would declare the age of the juvenile or the child. in case exact assessment of the age can not be d the court or the board or as the case may be the child welfare committee for reasons to be recorded by it may if considered necessary give benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his / her age on the lower side within a margin of year. as will therefore be clear from the provisions of the juvenile justice act as amended by the amendment act and the juvenile justice rules the scheme of the act is to give children who have for some reason or the other g astray to realise their mistakes rehabilitate themselves and rebuild their lives and become useful citizens of society instead of degenerating into hardened criminals. of the main questions decided in pratap singh case manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ scc scc cri point is now well established that the juvenility of a person in conflict with law has to be reckd from the date of the incident and not from the date on which cognizance was taken by the magistrate. the effect of the other part of the decision was however neutralised by virtue of the amendments to the juvenile justice act by act of whereunder the provisions of the act were also made applicable to juveniles who had not completed years of age on the date of commission of the offence. the law as now crystallised on a conjoint reading of sections and read with rules and places beyond all doubt that all persons who were below the age of years on the date of commission of the offence even prior to --would be treated as juveniles even if the claim of juvenility was raised after they had attained the age of years on or before the date of commencement of the act and were undergoing sentence upon being convicted. the above view was reiterated by a bench of judges in abuzar hossain alias $$$ v. state of west bengal manu / manu / scc as . a claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage even after the final disposal of the case. it may be raised for the time before this court as well after the final disposal of the case. the delay in raising the claim of juvenility can not be a ground for rejection of such claim. the claim of juvenility can be raised in appeal even if not pressed before the trial court and can be raised for the time before this court though not pressed before the trial court and in the appeal court.. for making a claim with regard to juvenility after conviction the claimant must produce some material which may prima facie satisfy the court that an inquiry into the claim of juvenility is necessary initial burden has to be discharged by the person who claims juvenility9. as to what materials would prima facie satisfy the court and/or are sufficient for discharging the initial burden can not be catalogued nor can it be laid down as to what weight should be given to a specific piece of evidence which may be sufficient to raise presumption of juvenility but the documents referred to in rules to iii shall definitely be sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the court about the age of the delinquent necessitating further enquiry under rule. the statement recorded under section of the code is too tentative and may not by itself be sufficient ordinarily to justify or reject the claim of juvenility. the credibility and/or acceptability of the documents like the school leaving certificate or the voters ' list etc. obtained after conviction would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard -and -fast rule can be prescribed that they must be prima facie accepted or rejected. in $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc scc cri and $$$ / sc/09/$$$$manu / sc/09/$$$$ scc scc cri these documents were not found prima facie credible while in $$$ / sc/09/$$$$manu / sc/09/$$$$ scc scc cri the documents viz. school leaving certificate marksheet and the medical report were treated sufficient for directing an inquiry and verification of the appellant 's age. if such documents prima facie inspire confidence of the court the court may act upon such documents for the purposes of section and order an enquiry for determination of the age of the delinquent.. an affidavit of the claimant or any of the parents or a sibling or a relative in support of the claim of juvenility raised for the time in appeal or revision or before this court during the pendency of the matter or after disposal of the case shall not be sufficient justifying an enquiry to determine the age of such person unless the circumstances of the case are so glaring that satisfy the judicial conscience of the court to order an enquiry into determination of the age of the delinquent.. the court where the plea of juvenility is raised for the time should always be guided by the objectives of the act and be alive to the position that the beneficent and salutary provisions contained in the act are not defeated by the hypertechnical approach and the persons who are entitled to get benefits of the act get such benefits. the courts should not be unnecessarily influenced by any general impression that in schools the parents / guardians understate the age of their wards by or years for future benefits or that age determination by medical examination is not very precise. the matter should be considered prima facie on the touchstone of preponderance of probability.. claim of juvenility lacking in credibility or frivolous claim of juvenility or patently absurd or inherently improbable claim of juvenility must be rejected by the court at the threshold whenever raised. again in union of india v. ex -gnr ajeet singh manu / sc/02/$$$$manu / sc/02/$$$$ scc it was held:9. the provisions of the jj act have been interpreted by this court time and again and it has been clearly explained that raising the age of juvenile to years from years would apply retrospectively. it is also clear that the plea of juvenility can be raised at any time even after the relevant judgment / order has attained finality and even if no such plea had been raised earlier. furthermore it is the date of the commission of the offence and not the date of taking cognizance or of framing of charges or of the conviction that is to be taken into consideration. moreover where the plea of juvenility has not been raised at the initial stage of trial and has been taken only on the appellate stage this court has consistently maintained the conviction but has set aside the sentence.see jayendra v. state of u.p. manu / sc/05/$$$$manu / sc/05/$$$$ scc scc cri air sc $$$ v. state of w.b. manu / sc/0/9manu / sc/0/9 supp scc scc cri air sc

sc/0679/$$$$manu / sc/0679/$$$$ scc laying down as follows:80. the settled legal position therefore is that in all such cases where the accused was above years but below years of age on the date of occurrence the proceedings pending in the court concerned will continue and be taken to their logical end except that the court upon finding the juvenile guilty would not pass an order of sentence against him. instead he shall be referred to the board for appropriate orders under the act. applying that proposition to the case at hand the trial court and the high court could and indeed were legally required to record a finding as to the guilt or otherwise of the appellant. all that the courts could not have done was to pass an order of sentence for which purpose they ought to have referred the case to the juvenile justice board. the matter can be examined from another angle. section of the act prescribes the procedure to be followed when a claim of juvenility is made before any court. section is as under:7-a. procedure to be followed when claim of juvenility is raised before any court.if the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence under sub -section it shall forward the juvenile to the board for passing appropriate order and the sentence if any passed by a court shall be deemed to have no effect. a careful reading of the above would show that although a claim of juvenility can be raised by a person at any stage and before any court upon such court finding the person to be a juvenile on the date of the commission of the offence it has to forward the juvenile to the board for passing appropriate orders and the sentence if any passed shall be deemed to have sic no effect. there is no provision suggesting leave alone making it obligatory for the court before whom the claim for juvenility is made to set aside the conviction of the juvenile on the ground that on the date of commission of the offence he was a juvenile and hence not triable by an ordinary criminal court. applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius it would be reasonable to hold that the law insofar as it requires a reference to be made to the board excludes by necessary implication any intention on the part of the legislature requiring the courts to set aside the conviction recorded by the lower court. parliament it appears was content with setting aside the sentence of imprisonment awarded to the juvenile and making of a reference to the board without specifically or by implication requiring the court concerned to alter or set aside the conviction. that perhaps is the reason why this court has in several decisions simply set aside the sentence awarded to the juvenile without interfering with the conviction recorded by the court concerned and thereby complied with the mandate of section of the act. faced with the above learned counsel for the state fairly stated that the petitioner may be entitled to the relief sought. he however points out that a person claiming juvenile must approach the trial court . since in the present case the high court has declined to entertain an application as per order dated december a copy of which has been produced we consider it appropriate to entertain this application. in view of the above undisputed legal position we have no option but to allow this application and while leaving the conviction undisturbed set aside the sentence. the petitioner may be released from custody forthwith unless required in any other case.
