crl. appeal no. of arising out of slp crl.no. of. leave granted. this appeal has been preferred by the $$$ -accused against the judgment dated.passed by the high court of karnataka at bangalore in criminal revision petition no. of. by the impugned judgment the high court affirmed the conviction and sentenced imposed on the accused -appellant for offence under section of the negotiable instruments act hereinafter referred to as the act for short. the $$$ is the accused whereas the respondent is the complainant before the trial court. the accused -$$$ is said to be the managing director of $$$ far east export trading company private limited patalganga raigad district maharashtra whereas the complainant is $$$ of a concern by name yermal fish trading yft carrying on the business of supplying fishes. an agreement was reached on.between the company $$$ far east export trading company private limited and yermal fish trading wherein the complainant has supplied beheaded and gutter $$$ fish to the accused company. the accused was paying the amount through telegraphic transfer and under the terms of the agreement the complainant was to send the statement of accounts by fax for every days. at $$$$ i.on.the complainant sent the final statement under which the accused was liable to pay rs. -to the complainant. the accused had called the complainant to his company on.to settle the debt and at that time the accused issued cheques of the state bank of india bearing no. dated.for rs. lakhs bearing no. dated.for rs. lakhs and bearing no. dated.for rs. lakhs. the accused on behalf of the company had undertaken to settle the balance amount of rs. during $$$$. it appears that the complainant presented the cheques dated.for rs. lakhs to the corporation bank and the said cheque was returned with endorsement payment stopped and funds insufficient. the complainant issued a legal notice dated.by fax and also by registered post. in absence of any payment made the complainant approached the trial court and submitted a complaint. the trial court on appreciating of evidence convicted the accused -appellant for the offence under section of the act. $$$ appearing on behalf of the $$$ submitted that the $$$ was the managing director of $$$ far east export trading company private limited. the cheque was issued on behalf of the aforesaid company but the said company was not impleaded as accused in the trial. according to the $$$ in view of law laid down by this court in $$$ v. godfather travels and tours private limited ' $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc the prosecution against the $$$ was void ab -initio. in $$$ 's case $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ scc the court inter alia held... it is to be borne in mind that section of the act is concerned with the offences by the company. it makes the other persons vicariously liable for commission of an offence on the part of the company. as has been stated by us earlier the vicarious liability gets attracted when the condition precedent laid down in section of the act stands satisfied. there can be no dispute that as the liability is penal in nature a strict construction of the provision would be necessitous and in a way the warrant..... applying the doctrine of strict construction we are of the considered opinion that commission of offence by the company is an express condition precedent to attract the vicarious liability of others. thus the words as well as the company appearing in the section make it absolutely unmistakably clear that when the company can be prosecuted then only the persons mentioned in the other categories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to the averments in the petition and proof thereof.  can not be oblivious of the fact that the company is a juristic person and it has its own respectability. if a finding is recorded against it it would create a concavity in its reputation. there can be situations when the corporate reputation is affected when a director is indicted. in view of our aforesaid analysis we arrive at the irresistible conclusion that for maintaining the prosecution under section of the act arraigning of a company as an accused is imperative. the other categories of offenders can only be brought in the dragnet on the touchstone of vicarious liability as the same has been stipulated in the provision itself. we say so on the basis of the ratio laid down in c.v. parekh which is a -judge $$$ decision. thus the view expressed in sheoratan agarwal does not correctly lay down the law and accordingly is hereby overruled. the decision in $$$ is overruled with the qualifier as stated in para. the decision in $$$ has to be treated to be restricted to its own facts as has been explained by us hereinabove. the said case was also followed in $$$ v. star india private limited and another $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ r.c.r. civil r.c.r. criminal $$$$ $$$ r.a.j.scale. $$$ appearing on behalf of the respondent contended that the judgment in $$$ 's case can not be made applicable retrospectively in respect of cases where the conviction took place much prior to the judgment. however on such ground the relief can not be denied to the accused. the decision in $$$ 's case may be prospective but that will be applicable to all the pending cases including the trial appeal or revision or special leave petition / appeal pending before this court. in view of the aforesaid position we hold that the judgment rendered in $$$ 's case is also applicable to the case of the accused -appellant. following the decision in $$$ 's case we set aside the judgment dated.passed by the sessions judge udupi in criminal appeal no. of the order of conviction dated.in cc. no. of passed by the j.m.f.c. udupi district uduppi and
