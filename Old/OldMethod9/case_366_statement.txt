s.b. sinha j. whether the government of $$$ pradesh while framing a.p. educational institutions regulation of admissions order made in terms of $$$ of the constitution of india was bound to provide reservation for % of non -local seats although reservations in terms of its policy decision had been taken in respect of seats available for local candidates is the question involved in these appeals which arise out of a judgment and order dated.of the full bench of the $$$ pradesh high court. the first respondent herein is said to be a member of scheduled caste. he questid the validity of policy decision of the state of $$$ pradesh as regards non -reservation for scheduled castes scheduled tribes and $$$ by filing a writ petition in the high court. a learned single judge of the $$$ pradesh high court by a judgment and order dated.directed the appellant herein to reserve seats for the reserved category for % open seats also. a review application filed by the appellant herein before the learned single judge was dismissed. $$$ the appellant preferred a letters patent appeal before the division bench questioning the said order of the learned single judge. the division bench however noticing conflict in some decisions on the question referred the matter to a full bench on the following question:"whether the reservations in terms of $$$ of the constitution of india in favour of scheduled castes. scheduled tribes and $$$ could be provided even in respect of % of the unreserved seats under the presidential order. by reason of the impugned judgment the said appeals were dismissed. the appellant is thus in appeal before us. by reason of the constitution 3nd amendment act a special provision by way of $$$ of the constitution of india was inserted in respect of the state of $$$ pradesh relating to both employment and education pursuant to or in furtherance whereof the president was empowered to make orders in relation thereto contained in different provisions for different parts of the state. pursuant to or in furtherance of the said power. a.p. educational institution regulation of admissions order. hereinafter referred to as the presidential order was made. the relevant provisions of the presidential order are as para- available seats in relation to any courses of study as number of seats provided in that course for admission at any time after excluding those reserved for candidates from outside the state. it defines local area in respect of any university or other educational institution as the local area specified in para-3 of the order for the purpose of admission to such university or other educational institution.b para-3 carves out the local areas by reference to the earliest universities operating in $$$. telengana and $$$ areas

as. the proviso to the para ordains that there should be at least unreserved seat.e para- enables the president by order to require the state to issue such directions as may be necessary or expedient effectuating the provisions of the order to any university or other educational institution which shall comply with such directions.f para- reiterates the overriding effect set out in $$$ of the parent $$$ and mandates that the provisions of the order shall have the effect notwithstanding anything contained in any statute ordinance rules regulations or other orders whether made before or

other competent authority whether before or after the commencement of the order in respect of reservations in the matter of admissions to any university or the educational institution in favour of women socially the educationally backward class of citizens the schedule castes and scheduled tribes in so far as such provisions are not inconsistent with the order. with a view to prescribe the procedure adopted for admissions the government of $$$ issued g.o. ms. no. dated.whereby and whereunder it was directed that the procedure framed in $$$$ -thereto would be followed in the matter of implementation of reservations in favour of local candidates provided under the presidential order in respect of non -statewide universities and non -statewide educational institutions subject to its

the number of seats reserved for candidates from outside the state. the number of seats reserved in favour of local candidates in relation to local area in respect of the university or other educational institution concerned shall then be determined this number shall be % of the available sets any fraction of a seat being counted as provided that there shall be at least unreserved seat:3. from amongst all eligible applicants. whether such applicants are local candidates or not a provisional list of admission to fill the available seats shall be drawn up. this provisional list shall be

admission. the candidates included in the provisional admission list shall be arranged in order of merit or where the rules of admission provide for their arrangement in any other order in the order so provided:". mr. g. $$$ learned counsel appearing on be of the appellant has raised a short question in support of this appeal. the learned counsel would submit that the high court committed a manifest error in issuing the impugned direction insofar as it failed to take into consideration that having regard to the fact that the appellant has already made reservations to the extent of % % and % for scheduled castes scheduled tribe and $$$ respectively covering % of the seats no further reservation could be made in respect of balance % of the seats as by reason thereof the seats reserved for the reserved category candidates would exceed %. it has been pointed out that out of seats for admission in the post graduate courses seats were already reserved which would account for % of the seats and thus if reservation is directed to be made in relation to seats which would have g to the local candidates seat out of it will have to be reserved which would mean reservation in excess of the quota of reservation made in terms of regulation which reads thus:". reservation in favour of the local candidates(a admission to % of the seats shall be reserved in favour of the local

regulation-(c. the state of $$$ enacted the a.p. educational institutions regulation of admissions and prohibition of capitation fee act. in exercise of its rule making power conferred upon it thereunder the state government also framed the a.p. medical college admissions into post graduate medical course rules. by reason of g.o. ms. no. dated.reservation to the extent % % and % of the total number of seats was notified in each group of degree and diploma courses in favour of scheduled castes scheduled tribes and $$$ respectively to the extent of % of the seats reserved in favour of the local candidates in relation to the local areas in terms of the presidential order. so far as % of the balance seats are concerned the same were made unreserved i. seats for open category candidates. the university of health sciences $$$ also made regulations for admission to post graduate medical courses in the medical college in university of health sciences for the academic year -in terms of the presidential order as also the rules. pursuant to presidential order of the state of $$$ was sub -divided into local university areas namely osmania university andhra university and sri venkateshwara university. all these university areas are situated in different regions of the state envisaged under the presidential order. a bare perusal of the definition of local area read with paragraph.and of the presidential order as referred to herein before it would be evident that % of the seats are reserved for local candidates in relation to local area. so far as an university area is concerned a local candidate in particular university area would be a non -local in another. the criteria for admission of a candidate in the super speciality courses in the university on the ground of being local of non -local is therefore directly referable to the university are and not the boundaries of the state of $$$. it was not the case of the respondents that the health university regulations framed by the state of $$$ was violative of the presidential order or $$$ medical colleges admission into post graduate medical courses rules. it is further not in dispute that in terms of rule of the andhra pradesh post graduate admission rules read with the health regulations % of the seats in each local areas are reserved for local candidates. it was not the contention of the respondents that admissions in the courses of studies had not been made on the basis of merit of the candidate in the entrance examination upon following the rules of reservations nor was it the contention of the respondents that the reservation made by the state to the extent of % in favour of the reserved classes was ultra vires $$$ and of the constitution of india. in the matter of admission the health university had followed the procedure provided in $$$$ iii of g.o. p no. dated.having regard to the fact that by reason of the presidential order only % of the seats are reserved in favour of the local candidates which are required to be confined to the university area only. we thus do not find any legal infirmity in the action of the appellants herein in directing that % reserved for candidates of non -local area may be filled up only on merit. article of the constitution of india contains a special provision applicable to the state of andhra pradesh only. % of seats are required to be filled up from open categories and % of seats are to be filled up from the reserved category candidates in each of the regions from the medical colleges and engineering colleges. having regard to the reservations made region -wide indisputably % of seats are to be filled up from amongst local candidates whereas only % of seats are to be filled up from amongst outside candidates. articles and of the constitution of india provide for enabling provisions. by reason thereof the state would be entitled to either adopt a policy decision or make laws providing for reservations. how and in what manner the reservations should be made is a matter of policy decision of the state. such a policy decision normally would not be open to challenge subject to its passing the test of reasonableness as also the requirements of the presidential order made in terms of article of the constitution of india. it is not in dispute that limited seats are available for admission in the super speciality courses. it may be true that normally the reservation has to be made for the entire state but in terms of article of the constitution of india reservation has to be made region -wise. the seats have been reserved indisputably on total available seats in each discipline and those who came within the z of consideration are considered for admission from amongst the reserved category candidates. once it is found that reservation has been made for the reserved category candidates on the total number of seats available in each course the high court must be held to have committed a manifest error in issuing the impugned direction. having regard to the fact reservation has been provided to the extent of % of all the seats the question of any further reservation i. for the remaining % of the seats would not arise. the high court keeping in view the decision of this court in $$$ v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/0665/92$$$ / sc/0665/92 was bound to proceed on the basis that the reservation can not exceed %. in the said case it was held:"just as every power must be exercised reasonably and fairly the power conferred by $$$ of article should also be exercised in a fair manner and within reasonable limits -and what is more reasonable than to say that reservation under $$$ shall not exceed % of the appointments or posts barring certain extraordinary situations as explained hereinafter..while % shall be the rule it is necessary not to put out of consideration certain extraordinary situations inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people. it might happen that in far flung and remote areas the population inhabiting those areas might on account of their being out of the mainstream of national life and in view of conditions peculiar to and characteristicallyl to them need to be treated in a different way some relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative. in doing so extreme caution is to be exercised and a special case made out..reservation being extreme form of protective measure or affirmative action it should be confined to minority of seats. even though the constitution does not lay down any specific bar but the constitutional philosophy being against proportional equality the principle of balancing equality ordains reservation of any manner not to exceed %.emphasis supplied)17. in r.k. sabharwal v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/09/95$$$ / sc/09/95 this court observed:"when the state government after doing the necessary exercise makes the reservation and provides the extent of percentage of posts to be reserved for the said $$$ then the percentage has to be followed strictly. the prescribed percentage can not be varied or changed simply because some of the members of the backward class have already been appointed promoted against the genera seats. as mentid above the roster point which is reserved for a backward class has to be filled by way of appointment promotion of the member of the said class. no general category candidate can be appointed against a slot in the roster which is reserved for the backward class. the fact that considerable number of members of a backward class have been appointed promoted against general seats in the state services may be a relevant factor for the state government to review the question of continuing reservation for the said class but so long as the instructions / rules providing certain percentage of reservations for the $$$ are operative the same have to be followed. despite any number of appointees promotees belonging to the $$$ against the general category posts the given percentage has to be provided in addition. reservation is aimed at securing equal and protective discrimination. recently the purpose of reservation although in a different context has been stated by this court in a.i.i.m.s. student union v. a.i.i.m.s. $$$ / sc/0480/01$$$ / sc/0480/01 air01sc32. it was as an exception may be justified subject to discharging the burden of proving justification in favour of the class which must be educationally handicapped the reservation geared up to getting over the handicap. the rationale of reservation in the case of medical students must be removal of regional or class inadequacy or like disadvantage. even there the quantum of reservation should not be excessive or societally injurious. the higher the level of the speciality the lesser the role of reservation..any reservation apart from being sustainable on the constitutional anvil must also be reasonable to be permissible. in assessing the reasonability of the factors to be taken into consideration would be whether the character and quantum of reservation would stall or accelerate achieving the ultimate goal of excellence enabling the national constantly rising to higher levels. in the era of globalisation where the nation as a whole has to compete with other nations of the world so as to survive excellence can not be given an unreasonable go by and certainly not compromised in its entirety. fundamental duties though not enforceable by a writ of the court yet provide a valuable guide and aid to interpretation of constitutional and legal issues. in case of doubt or choice people 's wish as manifested through article 51-a can serve as a guide not only for resolving the issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the courts. in marri chandra sekhar rao v. $$$ seth g.s. medical college and ors. $$$ / sc/0457/1990$$$ / sc/0457/1990 it was held:"equality must become a living reality for the large masses of the people. those who are unequal in fact can not be treated by identical standards that may be equality in law but it would certainly not be real equality. existence of equality of opportunity depends not merely on the absence of disabilities but on presence of abilities. it is not simply a matter of legal equality. de jure equality must ultimately find its raison d'etre in de facto equality. the state must therefore resort to compensatory state action for the purpose of making people who are factually unequal in their wealth. education or social environment equal in specified areas. it is necessary to take into account de facto inequalities which exist in the society and to take affirmative action by way of giving preference and reservation to the socially and economically disadvantaged persons or inflicting handicaps on those more advantageously placed in order to bring about real equality. the principle of fixing the percentage of reservation emanates from the doctrine of reasonableness. in $$$ v. state of mysore manu / sc/0080/1962manu / sc/0080/1962 air1963sc649 this court speaking through gajendragadkar j. struck down the government order impugned therein describing it as a fraud on the constitution and the action of the executive was characterized as patently and plainly outside the limits of the constitutional authority conferred on the state. in.m. $$$ v. state of kerala manu / sc/0479/1975manu sc/0479/1975 it was held that reservation exceeding % had been permitted on the ground that scs were not castes in a real sense and article was not an exception. krishna iyer j. in karmachari sangh air sc however abandd the aforementid theory wherein his lordship held that he was prepared to assume that they were castes and in any event article was an exception. in the said judgment the final address of dr. $$$ to the constituent assembly was dealt with in extenso. sri. h.m. $$$ in his classic treatise on constitutional law of india. fourth edition at page states:"but this passage gives an incorrect impression of dr. ambedkar 's final address. he was not thinking of the scs and sts or of the equality code as the following passage clearly shows i remember $$$$ when politically minded indians resented the expression the people of india. they preferred the expression the indian nation. i am of the opinion that in believing that we are a nation we are cherishing a greet delusion. how can people divided into of castes be a nation the sor we realize that we are not as yet a nation in the social and physiological sense of the word the better for us. for then only we shall realise the necessity of becoming a nation and seriously think of ways and means of realising the goal. the realisation of his goal is going to be very difficult -far more difficult that it has been in the united states. the united states has no caste problem. in india there are castes. the castes are anti -national. in the place because they bring about separation in social life. they are anti -national also because they generate jealousy and antipathy between caste and caste. but we must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality. for fraternity can be a fact only when there is a nation. without fraternity equality and liberty will be no deeper than coats of paint. the learned author states a service which lacks an esprit de corps that is consciousness of and pride in belonging to a particular service lacks an element essential to an efficient and harmonies administration. to balance the claims of these parties in consideration reservation quotas requires critical analysis and calm delebration anger at the treatment meted out to classes to which of the parties belongs does not help for anger has been rightly likened to a hasty servant who runs away before he has heard the message. further it was opined:"it is necessary to remember that in litigation there are more parties than that it is wrong to gratify the plaintiff to the detriment of the defendant and that while sympathy is a most commendable quality it never appears in a less attractive guise than when it is practiced at the expense of somebody else.if past injustice done to members of scs and sts because of the accident of their birth calls for condemnation so does injustice done to members of advanced classes because of the accident of their birth. it may be that members of advanced classes may have to bear for a time as best as they can the injustice done to them by reverse discrimination if a long standing historical wrong has to be righted. but years have gone by since our constitution came into force and $$$$ that passes increases the individual 's sense of injustice and injury. it is submitted that judges who have to balance the claims of all the parties affected by any action under article ought to reflect that if the injustice of the past are to be strongly denounced now then the future will denounce quite as strongly the injustices suffered by members of advanced classes since. in $$$ supra it has been clearly held that the doctrine of principles of reservations have to be applied having regard to the vacancy position as existing in the entire area the only exception being the cases which would be falling under article. in k. duraisamy and anr. v. state of t.n. and ors.manu / sc/0044/2001manu / sc/0044/2001 this court held:"the mere use of the word reservation per se does not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective reservation specially designed for the advancement of any socially -and -educationally -backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to enable them to enter and adequately represent in various fields. the meaning content and purport of the expression will necessarily depend upon the purpose and object with which it is used. in the event the ratio of the impugned judgment of the high court is given effect to having regard to the limited number of seats available by providing reservation of an additional seat principle of reservation to the extent is % would be violated. furthermore it is not for the high court to say as to the efficacy or otherwise of the policy of the state as regard providing for reservation for the reserved category candidates and in that view of the matter the high court in our opinion must be held to have committed a manifest error in issuing the impugned directions as a result whereof percentage of reservation would exceed %. such a direction by the high court is not contemplated in law. the impugned direction of the high court therefore can not be sustained. it is set aside accordingly. these appeals are allowed but in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
