r. $$$ j. leave granted. this appeal arises out of the order dated.passed by the high court of delhi dismissing the appeal being rsa no. of as abated and also the interlocutory applications being cm nos. -and to bring on record the legal representatives of the $$$s herein. respondent -$$$ filed a suit bearing no. against $$$ and $$$ for declaration and permanent injunction. case of respondent -plaintiff is that he is the owner of parcel of land measuring sq. yards bearing plot nos. and out of rect. no. $$$ no. situated in the area of village $$$ delhi in the abadi of prem $$$. $$$ delhi. the aforesaid parcel of land is also claimed by late $$$ contending that the land was purchased by him on.from premlata and her husband chander prakash. the trial court initially dismissed the suit vide judgment dated.. in the appeal the appellate court set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and the matter was remanded back to the trial court to decide the matter afresh. trial court considered the entire matter afresh and again dismissed the suit bearing no. of the respondent / $$$ vide judgment dated.. respondent / $$$ again feeling aggrieved preferred a fresh appeal bearing rca no. /00 against the said judgment and the decree.  appellate court by judgment dated.set aside the judgment and decree passed by the trial court and allowed the appeal of $$$. during the pendency of the appeal defendant -$$$ died on.that is almost years prior to the date of judgment of the appellate court. even though $$$ has expired on.no steps were taken to bring on record the legal representatives of late $$$. being aggrieved by the judgment of the appellate court $$$ represented by his legal representatives and the $$$ -swaraj filed appeal before the high court of delhi. during the pendency of the appeal $$$ no. also died on..  appeal itself was dismissed for non prosecution on.. applications were filed bearing cm nos. -for restoration and condonation of delay. on the basis of the said applications the high court had passed an order on.restoring the appeal to its original number. after restoration the appeal was dismissed by the high court on the following grounds:(i. the $$$s have not taken steps to bring on record the legal representatives of $$$ either in the appeal or at the time when the appeal was filed.  appeal was purportedly filed on behalf of the legal heirs of late $$$ without there being any affidavit or vakalatnama signed by any of them or no application under order xxii rule code of civil procedure has been filed along with the appeal. the proceedings against $$$ had abated even during the pendency of the appeal itself and it was improper on the part of the $$$s to have mentid the names of legal heirs of $$$ in the memo of appeal.  $$$ -swaraj also died on.and an order was passed on.that the appeal abated qua the $$$ as no steps were taken to bring on record his legal representatives.  $$$ -swaraj died on.. cm nos. of under order xxii rule code of civil procedure and of under order xxii rule code of civil procedure in rsa no. were filed to set aside the abatement against $$$ no. and also to bring on record the legal representatives of the $$$. since application for condonation of delay in filing the applications was not filed those applications were withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh application. since fresh applications were not filed to bring on record the legal representatives of the $$$ the appeal was dismissed qua the $$$ by order dated.. it is clear from the combined reading of order xxii rules and code of civil procedure that the doctrine of abatement is applicable equally to a suit as well as to an appeal. it is seen from the records that fresh applications viz. for condonation of delay under order xxii rule code of civil procedure and under order xxii rule code of civil procedure were filed to set aside the abatement caused due to the death of the appellant -swaraj. as noticed earlier appeal being rsa no. 0/0 was dismissed for non prosecution on.. by order dated.the appeal was restored to file on payment of cost of rs. the relevant portion of the order reads as under..in view of the reasoning given the order dated.is recalled subject to costs of rs. the application stands disposed of..rsa 0/$$$$ and cm for stay for delay under order rule code of civil procedure and under order rule code of civil procedure..since the appeal has been revived the interim order dated.also stands revived.it appears even though appeal was restored no specific order was passed to restore the applications cm no. and. but the facts remain that fresh applications no. under order xxii rule code of civil procedure and under order xxii rule code of civil procedure were filed for condonation of delay and to set aside the abatement and to bring on record the legal representatives of appellant no. when the appeal was restored to file specific order ought to have been passed restoring the above applications and setting aside the abatement and the legal representatives of the appellant no. ought to have been brought on record. without passing specific order on those applications high court was not right in dismissing the appeal as abated qua the appellant. in so far as the appellant late $$$ he died on.during the pendency of the appeal and in the appellate court no steps were taken to bring on record the legal representatives of late $$$. in the appeal respondent -balbir singh was the appellant and it was his responsibility to bring on record the legal representatives of late $$$. when the appeal was filed memo of appeal contained the names of legal representatives of late $$$. it may be that legal representatives have not signed memo of appeal. in the appeal if the legal representatives of $$$ were brought on record the cause title in the decree of the appellate court would have carried the names of legal heirs of late $$$. there would have been discrepancy between the decree of the appellate court and the memo of the appeal. when the appeal was filed the high court registry should have checked up the names of the parties as occurred in the decree of the courts below and the memo of appeal and the defects should have been pointed out at that time. but that was not to be so. since no steps were taken to bring on record the legal representatives of late $$$ either in the appeal or in the appeal the appellants have filed cm no. under order i rule code of civil procedure read with section code of civil procedure to implead shakuntala ii $$$ iii rachna and $$$. code of civil procedure order xxii stipulates the manner in which the legal representatives of plaintiffs or defendants ought to be brought on record. the prescribed procedure can not be circumvented by filing application under order i rule code of civil procedure read with section code of civil procedure. however in our view it would be unjust to non -suit the appellants on the ground of technicalities.provisions of order xxii code of civil procedure are not penal in nature. it is a rule of procedure and substantial rights of the parties can not be defeated by pedantic approach by observing strict adherence to the procedural aspects of law. in sardar amarjit $$$ v. pramod gupta $$$ / sc/24/2002$$$ / sc/24/2002 scc a judge bench of this court held as under:26. laws of procedure are meant to regulate effectively assist and aid the object of doing substantial and real justice and not to foreclose even an adjudication on merits of substantial rights of citizen under personal property and other laws. procedure has always been viewed as the handmaid of justice and not meant to hamper the cause of justice or sanctify miscarriage of justice. a careful reading of the provisions contained in order code of civil procedure as well as the subsequent amendments thereto would lend credit and support to the view that they were devised to ensure their continuation and culmination in an effective adjudication and not to retard the further progress of the proceedings and thereby non -suit the others similarly placed as long as their distinct and independent rights to property or any claim remain intact and not lost forever due to the death of or the other in the proceedings. the provisions contained in order are not to be construed as a rigid matter of principle but must ever be viewed as a flexible tool of convenience in the administration of justice. the fact that the khata was said to be joint is of no relevance as long as each of them had their own independent distinct and separate shares in the property as found separately indicated in the jamabandi itself of the shares of each of them distinctly. we are also of the view that the high court should have on the very perception it had on the question of abatement allowed the applications for impleadment even dehors the cause for the delay in filing the applications keeping in view the serious manner in which it would otherwise jeopardize an effective adjudication on merits the rights of the other remaining appellants for no fault of theirs. interests of justice would have been better served had the high court adopted a positive and constructive approach than merely scuttled the whole process to foreclose an adjudication of the claims of others on merits. the rejection by the high court of the applications to set aside abatement condonation and bringing on record the legal representatives does not appear on the peculiar nature of the case to be a just or reasonable exercise of the court 's power or in conformity with the avowed object of the court to do real effective and substantial justice..underlining added). in sital prasad saxena d by l.rs. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/0294/984$$$ / sc/0294/984 scc it was observed that the rules of procedure under order xxii code of civil procedure are designed to advance justice and should be so interpreted as not to make them penal statutes for punishing erring parties. on sufficient cause delay in bringing the legal representatives of the deceased party on record should be condoned. procedure is meant only to facilitate the administration of justice and not to defeat the same. the dismissal of the appeal by the high court does not constitute a sound and reasonable exercise of its powers and the impugned order can not be sustained. in the result the impugned order is set aside and this appeal is allowed and the following directions are issued:(i. necessary applications were filed to bring on record the legal representatives of appellant no. since the suit is of the year and the appeal is of the year and in the interest of justice the applications no. for stay for condonation of delay under order xxii rule code of civil procedure and under order xxii rule code of civil procedure are allowed and legal representatives of appellant no. are ordered to be brought on record. cm no. filed under order rule code of civil procedure is treated as an application under order xxii rule code of civil procedure. the legal representatives of late $$$ viz.shakuntala ii gaurav iii rachna and $$$ are ordered to be brought on record and the application is allowed.iii. rsa no. on the file of the high court is ordered to be restored. memorandum of appeal be suitably amended and amended memo of appeal shall be filed before the high court within weeks. the high court shall afford sufficient opportunity of hearing to both parties and shall dispose of the appeal in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible.in the facts and circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs.
