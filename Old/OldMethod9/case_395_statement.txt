s.s.m. quadri j. these writ petitions have come up before us as a $$$ of learned judges of this court referred the mentid writ petition to a constitution $$$ observing thus whether the judgment of this court dated march in civil appeal no.of can be regarded as a nullity and whether a writ petition under $$$ of the constitution can be maintained to question the validity of a judgment of this court after the petition for review of the said judgment has been dismissed are in our opinion questions which need to be considered by a constitution $$$ of this court. the other writ petitions were tagged to that case. in these cases the following question of constitutional law of considerable significance arises for consideration whether an aggrieved person is entitled to any relief against a final judgment / order of this court after dismissal of review petition either under $$$ of the constitution or otherwise. in our endeavour to answer the question we may begin with noticing that the supreme court of india is established by $$$ of the constitution which specifies its jurisdiction and powers and enables parliament to confer further jurisdiction and powers on it. the constitution conferred on the supreme court original jurisdiction $$$ and appellate jurisdiction both civil and criminal $$$ jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal $$$ and very wide discretionary powers in the exercise of its jurisdiction to pass decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it which shall be enforceable throughout the territory of india in the manner prescribed $$$ powers like the power to withdraw any case pending in any high court or high courts to itself or to transfer any case from high court to another high court $$$ and to review judgment pronounced or order made by it $$$.conferment of further jurisdiction and powers is left to be provided by parliament by law $$$. parliament is also enabled to confer further powers on the supreme court($$$. $$$ says that the law declared by the supreme court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of india and $$$ directs that all authorities civil and judicial in the territory of india shall act in aid of the supreme court. it is a court of record and has all the powers of such a court including power to punish for contempt of itself $$$. since the jurisdiction of this court under $$$ of the constitution is invoked in these writ petitions we shall advert to the provisions of $$$ of the constitution. it is included in part iii of the constitution and is quoted hereunder. remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this part. the right to move the supreme court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part is guaranteed.the supreme court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this part.without prejudice to the powers conferred on the supreme court by clauses and parliament may by law empower any other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the supreme court under clause(.the right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this constitution. a perusal of the $$$ quoted above shows it contains clauses. clause guarantees the right to move the supreme court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by part iii -fundamental rights. by clause the supreme court is vested with the power to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by part iii. without prejudice to the powers of the supreme court in the aforementid clauses the parliament is enabled by clause to empower bylaw any other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the supreme court under clause. the constitutional mandate embodiedin clause is that $$$ shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by the constitution. $$$ as the supreme court enforces the fundamental rights by issuing appropriate directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari it may be useful to refer to in brief the characteristics of the writs in general and writ of certiorari in particular with which we are concerned here. in english law there are types of writs judicial procedural writs like writ of summons writ of motion etc. which are issued as a matter of course these writs are not in vogue in india and substantive writs often spoken of as high prerogative writs like writ of quo warranto habeas corpus mandamus certiorari and prohibition etc.they are frequently resorted to in indian high courts and the supreme court.historically prohibition was a writ whereby the royal courts of common law prohibited other courts from entertaining matters falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the common law courts;certiorari was issued to bring the record of an inferior court into the king 's $$$ for review or to remove indictments for trial in that court mandamus was directed to inferior courts and tribunals and to public officers and bodies to order the performance of a public duty. all were called prerogative writs.in england while issuing these writs at least in theory the assumption was that the king was present in the king 's court. the position regarding the house of lords is described thus of the court of parliament or of the king in parliament as it is sometimes expressed the only other supreme tribunal in this country.in rajunder narain $$$. bijai govind singh moo. p.c. they are discretionary writs but the principles for issuing such writs are well defined. in the pre -constitutional era the jurisdiction to issue the prerogative writs was enjoyed only by chartered high courts in india but with the coming into force of the constitution all the high courts and the supreme court are conferred powers to issue those writs under $$$ and $$$ respectively of the constitution. in regard to the writ jurisdiction the high courts in india are placed virtually in the same position as the courts of king 's $$$ in england. it is a well -settled principle that the technicalities associated with the prerogative writs in english $$$ have no role to play under our constitutional scheme. it is however important to note that a writ of certiorari to call for records and examine the same for passing appropriate orders is issued by a superior court to an inferior court which certifies its records for examination.certiorari lies to bring decisions of an inferior court tribunal public authority or any other body of persons before the high court for review so that the court may determine whether they should be quashed or to quash such decisions. the order of prohibition is an order issuing out of the high court and directed to an inferior court or tribunal or public authority which forbids that court or tribunal or authority to act in excess of its jurisdiction or contrary to law. both certiorari and prohibition a reemployed for the control of inferior courts tribunals and public authorities. having carefully examined the historical background and the very nature of writ jurisdiction which is a supervisory jurisdiction over inferior courts / tribunals in our view on principle a writ of certiorari can not be issued to co -ordinate courts and a fortiori to superior courts. thus it follows that a high court can not issue a writ to another high court nor can $$$ of a high court issue a writ to a different $$$ of the same high court much less can writ jurisdiction of a high court be invoked to seek issuance of a writ of certiorari to the supreme court. though the judgments / orders of high courts are liable to be corrected by the supreme court in its appellate jurisdiction under $$$ and as well as under $$$ of the constitution the high courts are not constituted as inferior courts in our constitutional scheme. therefore the supreme court would not issue a writ under $$$ to a high court. further neither a smaller $$$ not a larger $$$ of the supreme court can issue a writ under $$$ of the constitution to any other $$$ of the supreme court. it is pointed out above that $$$ can be invoked only for the purpose of enforcing the fundamental rights conferred in part iii and it is a settled position in law that no judicial order passed by any superior court in judicial proceedings can be said to violate any of the fundamental rights enshrined in part iii. it may further be noted that the superior courts of justice do not also fall within the ambit of state or other authorities under $$$ of the constitution. in naresh shridhar mirajkar & ors. vs. state of maharashtra & anr. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ some journalists filed a writ petition in the supreme court under $$$ of the constitution challenging an oral order passed by the high court of bombay on the original side prohibiting publication of the statement of a witness given in open court as being violative of $$$ of the constitution of india. a $$$ of -learned judges of this court considered the question whether the impugned order violated fundamental rights of the petitirs under $$$ and if so whether a writ under $$$ of the constitution would issue to the high court. the $$$ was unanimous on the point that an order passed by this court was not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this court under $$$ of the constitution. of the learned judges took the view that a judicial order can not be said to contravene fundamental rights of the petitirs. $$$ j. was of the view that the constitution does not contemplate the high courts to be inferior courts so their decisions would not be liable to be quashed by a writ of certiorari issued by the supreme court and held that this court had no power to issue a writ of certiorari to the high court. to the same effect are the views expressed by shah and bachawat $$$. though in his dissenting judgment hidayatullah j. as he then was held that a judicial order of the high court if errous could be corrected in an appeal under $$$ of the constitution he ntheless opined that the impugned order of the high court committed breach of the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression of the petitirs and could be quashed under $$$ of the constitution by issuing a writ of certiorari to the high court as subordination of the high court under the scheme of the constitution was not only evident but also logical. in regard to the apprehended consequences of his proposition the learned judge observed it was suggested that the high courts might issue writs to this court and to other high courts and judge or $$$ in the high court and the supreme court might issue a writ to another judge or $$$ in the same court. this is an errous assumption. to begin with the high courts can not issue a writ to the supreme court because the writ goes down and not up. similarly a high court can not issue a writ to another high court. the writ does not go to a court placed on an equal footing in the matter of jurisdiction. where the county court exercised the powers of the high court the writ was held to be wrongly issued to it see in re the new par consols limited 88( q.b.emphasis. in a.r. $$$ vs. r.s. nayak & anr. $$$ / sc/000/88$$$ / sc/000/88 the question debated before a -judge $$$ of this court was whether the order dated february passed by a constitution $$$ of this court withdrawing the cases pending against the appellant in the court of special judge and transferring them to the high court of bombay with a request to the chief justice to assign them to a sitting judge of the high court for holding trial from day to day. r.s. nayak vs. a.r. $$$ $$$ / sc/00/84$$$ / sc/00/84 84crilj was a valid order. it is relevant to notice that in that case the said order was not brought under challenge in a petition under $$$ of the constitution. indeed the appellant 's attempt to challenge the aforementid order of the constitution $$$ before this court under $$$ of the constitution turned out to be abortive on the view that the writ petition under $$$ ,challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by the supreme court as nullity or otherwise incorrect could not be entertained and that he might approach the court with appropriate review petition or any other application which he might be entitled to file in law. while so in the course of the trial of those cases the appellant raised an objection in regard to the jurisdiction of the learned judge of the high court to try the cases against him. the learned judge rejected the objection and framed charges against the appellant which were challenged by him by filing a special leave petition to appeal before this court wherein the question of jurisdiction of the high court to try the cases was also raised. it was numbered as criminal appeal no.of and was ultimately referred to a -judge $$$. by majority of : the appeal was allowed and all proceedings in the cases against the appellant before the high court pursuant to the said order of the constitution $$$ dated february were set aside and quashed. mukharji $$$ and natarajan $$$. took the view that the earlier order of this court dated february which deprived the appellant of his constitutional rights was contrary to the provisions of the act of and was in violation of the principles of natural justice and in the background of the said act was without any precedent and that the legal wrong should be corrected debito justitiae $$$ j.with whom $$$ j.agreed while concurring with the majority observed that it was a duty of the court to rectify the mistake by exercising inherent powers. $$$ j. expressed his agreement with the view of the majority that the order was bad being in violation of $$$ and of the constitution. however he held that the said order was not such order as to be recalled because it could not be said to be based on a view which was manifestly incorrect palpably absurd or patently without jurisdiction. in that he agreed with $$$ j. as he then was who gave a dissenting opinion. the learned judge held that it would be wholly errous to characterise the directions issued by a -judge $$$ as a nullity liable to be ignored and so declared in a collateral attack. however learned judges were unanimous that the court should act exdebi to justitiae. on the question of power of the supreme court to review its earlier order under its inherent powers mukharji $$$ and natarajan $$$. expressed the view that the court could do so even in a petition under $$$ or $$$ of the constitution. $$$ j. gave a dissenting opinion holding that the appeal could not be treated as a review petition. $$$ j. as he then was also gave a dissenting opinion that inherent powers of the court do not confer or constitute a source of jurisdiction and they are to be exercised in aid of a jurisdiction that is already invested for correcting the decision under $$$ read with order xl rule of the supreme court rules and for that purpose the case must go before the same judges as far as practicable. on the question whether a writ of certiorari under $$$ of the constitution could be issued to correct an earlier order of this court mukharji and natarajan $$$. concluded that the powers of review could be exercised under either $$$ or $$$ if there had been deprivation of fundamental rights. $$$ j. as he then was opined that no writ of certiorari was permissible as the $$$ of the supreme court are not subordinate to the larger $$$ of this court. to the same effect is the view expressed by $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ $$$. thus in that case by majority of : it was held that an order of the supreme court was not amenable to correction by issuance of a writ of certiorari under $$$ of the constitution. in smt. $$$ vs. state of gujarat $$$ / sc/00/8$$$ / sc/00/8 speaking for himself and other learned judges of the constitution $$$ oza j.reiterating the same principle observed it is well settled now that a judgment of court can never be challenged under $$$ or and therefore the judgment of the court awarding the sentence of death is not open to challenge as violating $$$ or $$$ as has been laid down by this court in naresh shridhar mirajkarvs. state of maharashtra and also in a.r. $$$. r.s. nayak the only jurisdiction which could be sought to be exercised by a prisr for infringement of his rights can be to challenge the subsequent events after the final judicial verdict is pronounced and it is because of this that on the ground of long or inordinate delay a condemned prisr could approach this court and that is what has consistently been held by this court. but it will not be open to this court in exercise of jurisdiction under $$$ to go behind or to examine the final verdict reached by a competent court convicting and sentencing the condemned prisr and even while considering the circumstances in order to reach a conclusion as to whether the inordinate delay coupled with subsequent circumstances could be held to be sufficient for coming to a conclusion that execution of the sentence of death will not be just and proper.$$$ j. expressed no opinion on this aspect. we consider it inappropriate to burden this judgment with discussion of the decisions in other cases taking the same view. suffice it to mention that various $$$ of this court reiterated the same principle in the following cases a.r. $$$ vs. r.s. nayak & anr. $$$ / sc/000/88$$$ / sc/000/88 $$$ vs. union of india & ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ $$$rsc07 $$$rsc07 $$$.aslam vs. union of india $$$ / sc/04/$$$ / sc/04/ khodaydistilleries ltd. & anr. vs. registrar general supreme court of india $$$ / sc/04/$$$ / sc/04/

anr. $$$ / sc/087/$$$ / sc/087/ a -judge $$$ and in other cases different $$$ quashed the earlier judgments / orders of this court in an application filed under $$$ of the constitution. but in those cases no joined issue with regard to the maintainability of the writ petition under $$$ of the constitution. therefore those cases can not be read as authority for the proposition that a writ of certiorari under $$$ lie to challenge an earlier final judgment of this court. on the analysis of the ratio laid down in the afore mentid cases we reaffirm our considered view that a final judgment / order passed by this court can not be assailed in an application under $$$ of the constitution of india by an aggrieved person whether he was a party to the case or not. in fairness to the learned counsel for the parties were cord that all of them at the close of the hearing of these cases conceded that the jurisdiction of this court under $$$ of the constitution can not be invoked to challenge the validity of a final judgment / order passed by this court after exhausting the remedy of review under $$$ of the constitution read with order xl rule of the supreme court rules. however all the learned counsel for the parties as also the learned attorney -general who appeared as amicus curiae on the notice of this court adopted an unusual unanimous approach to plead that even after exhausting the remedy of review under $$$ of the constitution an aggrieved person might be provided with an opportunity under inherent powers of this court to seek relief in cases of gross abuse of the process of the court or gross miscarriage of justice because against the order of this court the affected party can not have recourse to any other forum. mr. shanti bhushan the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitir submitted that the principle of finality of the order of this court had to be given a go -by and the case re -examined where the orders were passed without jurisdiction or in violation of the principles of natural justice violation of any fundamental rights or where there has been gross injustice. he invited our attention to order xlvii rule of the supreme court rules and submitted that this court had inherent jurisdiction and that cases falling in the aforementid categories should be examined under the inherent jurisdiction of this court. according to the learned counsel $$$ would not be available to correct a judgment of this court but he pleaded that as from the order of the apex court no appeal would lie therefore an application by whatever name called which should be certified by a senior counsel in regard to existence of permissible ground has to be entertained on any of the aforementid grounds to correct a judgment of this court. he cited $$$ 's case supreme court bar association 's case and $$$ 's case as instances in which this court had corrected its earlier judgments. he advocated for oral hearing on such an application and for hearing by a $$$ of judges other than those who passed the order on the ground that it would inspire confidence in the litigant public. mr. k.k.venugopal the learned senior counsel while adopting the arguments of mr. shanti bhushan submitted that the provisions of order xlvii rule of the supreme court rules is a mere restatement of the provisions of $$$ of the constitution and that the inherent jurisdiction of this court might be exercised to remedy the injustice suffered by a person. he suggested that a constitution $$$ consisting of senior judges and the judges who passed the order under challenge could be formed to consider the application seeking correction of final orders of this court. he added that to ensure that floodgates are not opened by such a remedy an application for invoking the inherent power of this court might require that it should be certified by a senior advocate and in case of frivolous application the petitir could be subjected to costs. he relied on the judgment of united states in united states of america vs. ohio power company $$$yers ' $$$. to show that in every jurisdiction the courts have corrected their own mistakes. he cited the judgment of this court in harbans singhvs. state of uttar pradesh & ors. $$$ / sc/007/8$$$ / sc/007/8 to show that even after the dismissal of the review petition the supreme court reconsidered its own judgment he pleaded for laying down guidelines in regard to entertaining such an application. mr. $$$ b. $$$ the learned senior counsel submitted that $$$ of the constitution declared this court to be a court of record so it would have inherent powers to pass appropriate orders to undo injustice to any party resulting from judgments of this court. he relied on the judgment of this court in supreme court bar association 's case supra to show that such a power was exercised by this court and pleaded to fashion appropriate procedure for entertaining application to reconsider earlier judgment of this court at the instance of an aggrieved person to do justice to the parties. the learned attorney -general argued that the remedy provided under $$$ of the constitution would not be available to a person aggrieved by the final order of this court;he ntheless supported the contentions urged by other learned counsel that in case of gross miscarriage of justice this court ought to exercise its inherent powers by entertaining an application to examine the final order of this court even when a review was rejected in the rarest of the rare cases. according to him where the order was passed without jurisdiction or in violation of the principles of natural justice the case would fall in the rarest of the rare cases. he however contended that an order of this court could not be said to violate fundamental rights conferred under part iii of the constitution and therefore on that ground no relief could be claimed. he submitted that under $$$ read with order xl rule of the supreme court rules review of an order of this court is provided which will be considered by the same $$$ unless the same judges are not available by reason of demitting the office. in regard to reconsideration of the judgment under the inherent power of the court he referred to the judgment of the federal court in raja prithwi chand lall choudhry etc. vs. $$$ sukhraj rai & ors. etc.fcr. hesubmitted that for correction of a final judgment of this court on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or violation of principle of natural justice a curative petition could be entertained which might be heard by an appropriate $$$ composed of the senior judges as well as judges who passed the order. dr.$$$ the learned senior counsel argued that since the supreme court is the creature of the constitution so the corrective power has to be derived from the provisions conferring jurisdiction on the supreme court like $$$ -such a power does not arise from an abstract inherent jurisdiction. the corrective power must be exercised so as to correct an injustice in a case of patent lack of jurisdiction in a narrow sense not in the anisminic 's broader sense and gross violation of natural justice. relying on the judgment of house of lords in r v bow street metropolitan stipendiary magistrate and others parte $$$(no.'s case all er he has submitted that this court has inherent power to correct its own judgment where a party through no fault of his own has been subjected to an unfair procedure giving scope for bias. his further contention is that the corrective power is a species of the review power and $$$ order xl rule and order xlvii rules indicate that this court has inherent power to set right its own judgment. he referred to the decisions of this court in antulay 's case supreme court bar association 's case $$$ 's case and $$$ 's case supra to impress upon us that this court has earlier exercised this power. he submitted that the supreme court can also issue practice direction in that behalf. mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel invited our attention to various provisions of the constitution dealing with different types of jurisdictions of this court and advocated that in case of manifest illegality and palpable injustice this court under its inherent powers could reconsider final judgment / order passed by this court. he submitted that the composition of the $$$ might include senior -most judges along with the judges who passed the order if available. it is also his submission that while considering such curative petitions on the ground of manifest illegality and palpable injustice in the rarest of rare cases factors like the doctrine of stare decisis and the finality and the certainty of the law declared by this court are required to be kept in mind. he referred to the judgment of this court rendered by learned judges in the keshav mills co. ltd. vs. commissir of income -tax bombay north $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ which was followed by another $$$ of learned judges reported in $$$ p ltd. vs. municipal corporation of greater bombay & ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ and by a $$$ of learned judges in the case of the indian aluminium co. ltd. vs. the commissir of income -tax west bengal calcutta $$$ / sc/0/7$$$ / sc/0/7. he stressed that the power of re -consideration of an earlier decision had to be very restricted when the power of review is very limited and circumscribed as is evident from the decision of the constitution $$$ in cauvery water disputes tribunal.scc and the $$$ of learned judges in s. $$$ & ors. vs. state of karnataka & anr. suppl.and in $$$ vs. state of assam $$$ / sc/07/00$$$ / sc/07/00 by learned judges and in the case of $$$ & ors. vs. union of india & ors. $$$ / sc/0/000$$$ / sc/0/000 the exercise of inherent power for correcting the manifest illegality and palpable injustice after dismissal of the review petition has to be much narrower than the power of review. these contentions pose the question whether an order passed by this court can be corrected under its inherent powers after dismissal of the review petition on the ground that it was passed either without jurisdiction or in violation of the principles of natural justice or due to unfair procedure giving scope for bias which resulted in abuse of the process of the court or miscarriage of justice to an aggrieved person. there is no gainsaying that the supreme court is the court of last resort -the final court on questions both of fact and of law including constitutional law. the law declared by this court is the law of the land it is precedent for itself and for all the courts / tribunals and authorities in india. in a judgment there will be declaration of law and its application to the facts of the case to render a decision on the dispute between the parties to the lis. it is necessary to bear in mind that the principles in regard to the highest court departing from its binding precedent are different from the grounds on which a final judgment between the parties can be reconsidered. here we are mainly concerned with the latter. however when re -consideration of a judgment of this court is sought the finality attached both to the law declared as well as to the decision made in the case is normally brought under challenge. it is therefore relevant to note that so much was the value attached to the precedent of the highest court that in the london street tramways company limited vs. the london county council lr appeal cases the house of lords laid down that its decision upon a question of law was conclusive and would bind the house in subsequent cases and that an errous decision could be set right only by an act of parliament. in hoystead & ors. vs. commissir of taxation lr ac lord $$$ observed parties are not permitted to begin fresh litigations because of new views they may entertain of the law of the case or new versions which they present as to what should be a proper apprehension by the court of the legal result.. if this were permitted litigation would have no end except when legal ingenuity is exhausted. to the same effect is the view expressed by the federal court of india in raja prithwi chand lall choudhary 's placing reliance on dicta of the privy council in venkata narasimha appa row vs. court of wards ii)appeal cases. gwyer cj. speaking for the federal court observed this court will not sit as a court of appeal from its own decisions nor will it entertain applications to review on the ground only that of the parties in the case conceives himself to be aggrieved by the decision. it would in our opinion be intolerable and most prejudicial to the public interest if cases once decided by the court could be re -opened and re -heard there is a salutary maxim which ought to be observed by all courts of last resort interest reipublicae ut sit finis lithium. its strict observance may occasionally entail hardship upon individual litigants but the mischief arising from that source must be small in comparison with the great mischief which would necessarily result from doubt being thrown upon the finality of the decisions of such a tribunal as this. in s. $$$ 's case supra an application was filed by the state for clarification of the order passed earlier. it was urged by the petitir that any modification or recalling of the order passed by this court would result in destroying the principle of finality enshrined in $$$ of the constitution. $$$ j. speaking for himself and for pandian j. observed justice is a virtue which transcends all barriers. neither the rules of procedure nor technicalities of law can stand in its way. the order of the court should not be prejudicial to any. rule of stare decisis is adhered for consistency but it is not as inflexible in administrative $$$ as in public $$$. even the law bends before justice. the learned judge referring to the judgment of raja prithwi chand lall choudhury 's case supra further observed even when there was no statutory provision and no rules were framed by the highest court indicating the circumstances in which it could rectify its order the courts culled out such power to avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of justice. the position with regard to conclusive nature of the precedent obtained in england till the following practice statement was made by lord $$$ l.c. in lloyds bank ltd. vs. dawson and ors. note all e.r. on behalf of himself and the lords of appeal in ordinary,"they propose therefore to modify their present practice and while treating former decisions of this house as normally binding to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.the principle in regard to departing from an earlier view by the house after the said practice statement is reflected in the speech of lord $$$ in $$$. secretary of state for social services $$$. secretary of state for social services conjoined appeals all e.r. who observed:"the old view was that any departure from rigid adherence to precedent would weaken that certainty. i did not and do not accept that view. it is notorious that where an existing decision is disapproved but can not be overruled courts tend to distinguish it on inadequate grounds. i do not think that they act wrongly in so doing they are adopting the less bad of the only alternatives open to them. but this is bound to lead to uncertainty for no can say in advance whether in a particular case the court will or will not feel bound to follow the old unsatisfactory decision. on balance it seems to me that overruling such a decision will promote and not impair the certainty of the law. but that certainty will be impaired unless this practice is used sparingly. i would not seek to categorise cases in which it should or cases in which it should not be used. as time passes experience will supply some guide. but i would venture the opinion that the typical case for reconsidering an old decision is where some broad issue is involved and that it should only be in rare cases that we should reconsider questions of construction of statutes or other documents. in fitzleet estates ltd. vs. cherry inspector of taxes all e.r. lord $$$ force observed $$$ in my firm opinion the practice statement was never intended to allow and should not be considered to allow such a course. nothing could be more undesirable in fact than to permit litigants after a decision has been given by this house with all appearance of finality to return to this house in the hope that a differently constituted committee might be persuaded to take the view which its predecessors rejected. true that the earlier decision was by majority i say nothing as to its correctness or as to the validity of the reasoning by which it was supported. that there were eminently possible views is shown by the support for each by at any rate members of the house. but doubtful issues have to be resolved and the law knows no better way of resolving them than by the considered majority opinion of the ultimate tribunal. it requires much more than doubts as to the correctness of such opinion to justify departing from it.lord edmund -davies observed $$$ i respectfully share your views that the chancery lane decision all.e.r. was correct. but even had i come to the opposite conclusion the circumstances adverted to are such that i should not have thought it right to depart from it now. to do so would have been to open the floodgates to similar appeals and thereby to impair that reasonable certainty in the law which the practice statement note all e.r. itself declared to be an indispensable foundation upon which to decide what is the law and its application to individual cases. the law existing in other countries is aptly summarised by $$$ in his treatise thus the authority to overrule exists in most countries whether of civil law or common law tradition. even the house of lords in the united kingdom is not bound any more by its precedents. the supreme court of the united states was never bound by its own decisions and neither are those of canada australia and israel. to what extent the principle of stare decisis binds this court was considered in the case of keshav mills co. ltd.supra. the question before a constitution $$$ of seven learned judges of this court was to what extent the principle of stare decisis could be pressed into service where the power of this court to overrule its earlier decisions was invoked. the court expressed its view thus when this court decides questions of law its decisions are under $$$ binding on all courts within the territory of india and so it must be the constant endeavour and concern of this court to introduce and maintain an element of certainty and continuity in the interpretation of law in the country. frequent exercise by this court of its power to review its earlier decisions on the ground that the view pressed before it later appears to the court to be more reasonable may incidentally tend to make law uncertain and introduce confusion which must be consistently avoided. that is not to say that if on a subsequent occasion the court is satisfied that its earlier decision was clearly errous it should hesitate to correct the error but before a previous decision is pronounced to be plainly errous the court must be satisfied with a fair amount of unanimity amongst its members that a revision of the said view is fully justified. it is not possible or desirable and in any case it would be inexpedient to lay down any principles which should govern the approach of the court in dealing with the question of reviewing and revising its earlier decisions. in maganlal chhaganlal 's case supra a $$$ of learned judges of this court considered inter alia the question whether a judgment of the supreme court in northern india caterers ' case was required to be overruled. $$$ j. observed at the same time it has to be borne in mind that certainty and continuity are essential ingredients of rule of law. certainty in law would be considerably eroded and suffer a serious set back if the highest court of the land readily overrules the view expressed by it in earlier cases even though that view has held the field for $$$$. in quite a number of cases which come up before this court views are possible and simply because the court considers that the view not taken by the court in the earlier case was a better view of the matter would not justify the overruling of the view. the law laid down by this court is binding upon all courts in the country under $$$ of the constitution and numerous cases all over the country are decided in accordance with the view taken by this court. many people arrange their affairs and large number of transactions also take place on the faith of the correctness of the view taken by this court. it would create uncertainty instability and confusion if the law propounded by this court on the basis of which numerous cases have been decided and many transactions have taken place is held to be not the correct law. in the case of the indian aluminium co. ltd. supra),the question before a constitution $$$ of learned judges was when can this court properly dissent from a previous view?. in regard to the effect of an earlier order of this court sawant j. speaking for the constitution $$$ observed in cauvery water disputes tribunal 's case supra as follows the decision of this court on a question of law is binding on all courts and authorities. hence under the said clause the president can refer a question of law only when this court has not decided it. secondly a decision given by this court can be reviewed only under $$$ read with $$$ of the supreme court rules on the conditions mentid therein. when further this court overrules the view of law expressed by it in an earlier case it does not do so sitting in appeal and exercising an appellate jurisdiction over the earlier decision. it does so in exercise of its inherent power and only in exceptional circumstances such as when the earlier decision is per in curiam or is delivered in the absence of relevant or material facts or if it is manifestly wrong and productive of public mischief. see bengal immunity company ltd. vs. state of bihar $$$ / sc/008/$$$ / sc/008/. in the cases of $$$ supra and $$$ supra the question before the court was the scope of the power of review of a judgment of this court under $$$7 of the constitution read with section order xlvii of the c.p.c. and order xl rule of the supreme court rules,66. in the case of ex parte $$$ no supra),on november the house of lords by majority warrant of arrest of senator $$$ who was the head of the state of chile and was to stand trial in spain for some alleged offences. it came to be known later that of the law lords lord $$$ who heard the case had links with amnesty international a.i.which had become a party to the case. this was not disclosed by him at the time of the hearing of the case by the house. $$$ on coming to know of that fact sought reconsideration of the said judgment of the house of lords on the ground of an appearance of bias not actual bias. on the principle of disqualification of a judge to hear a matter on the ground of appearance of bias it was pointed out,3. the principle that a judge was automatically disqualified from hearing a matter in his own cause was not restricted to cases in which he had a pecuniary interest in the outcome but also applied to cases where the judge 's decision would lead to the promotion of a cause in which the judge was involved together with of the parties. that did not mean that judges could not sit on cases concerning charities in whose work they were involved and judges would normally be concerned to reuse themselves or disclose the position to the parties only where they had an active role as trustee or director of a charity which was closely allied to and acting with a party to the litigation. in the instant case the facts were exceptional in that $$$ was a party to the appeal it had been joined in order to argue for a particular result and the law lord was a director of a charity closely allied to $$$ and sharing its objects. accordingly he was automatically disqualified from hearing the appeal. the petition would therefore be granted and the matter referred to another committee of the house for rehearing per curiam"36. on the point of jurisdiction of the house to correct any injustice in an earlier order it was observed in principle it must be that your lordships as the ultimate court of appeal have power to correct any injustice caused by an earlier order of this house. there is no relevant statutory limitation on the jurisdiction of the house in this regard and therefore its inherent jurisdiction remains unfettered. in cassell & co. ltd. v broome no.all er ac your lordships varied an order for costs already made by the house in circumstances where the parties had not had a fair opportunity to address argument on the point.and it was held,"an appeal to the house of lords will only be reopened where a party through no fault of its own has been subjected to an unfair procedure. a decision of the house of lords will not be varied or rescinded merely because it is subsequently thought to be wrong. we may notice here that in these cases except in raja prithwi chand lall choudhary supra and ex parte $$$ no.supra the question was in what circumstances the ratio in the earlier judgment of the highest court having precedent value could be departed. in the aforementid cases the decision was rendered on an application seeking re -consideration of the final judgment of the federal court and house of lords respectively. in view of the specific provision of $$$ of the constitution read with order xl rule of the supreme court rules conferring power of review on this court the problem in entertaining a review petition against its final judgment which its precursor -the federal court -had to face did not arise before this court. the petitirs in these writ petitions seek re -consideration of the final judgments of this court after they have been unsuccessful in review petitions and in that the secases are different from the cases referred to above. the provision of order xl rule of the supreme court rules bars further application for review in the same matter. the concern of the court now is whether any relief can be given to the petitirs who challenge the final judgment of this court though after disposal of review petitions complaining of the gross abuse of the process of court and remedial injustice. in a state like india governed by rule of law certainty of law declared and the final decision rendered on merits in a lis between the parties by the highest court in the country is of paramount importance. the principle of finality is insisted upon not on the ground that a judgment given by the apex court is impeccable but on the maxim interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium3. at time adherence to the principle of stare decisis was so rigidly followed in the courts governed by the english jurisprudence that departing from an earlier precedent was considered heresy. with the declaration of the practice statement by the house of lords the highest court in england was enabled to depart from a previous decision when it appeared right to do so. the next step forward by the highest court to do justice was to review its judgment inter parties to correct injustice. so far as this court is concerned we have already pointed out above that it has been conferred the power to review its own judgments under $$$ of the constitution. the role of judiciary merely to interpret and declare the law was the concept of byg age. it is no more open to debate as it is fairly settled that the courts can so mould and lay down the law formulating principles and guidelines as to adapt and adjust to the changing conditions of the society the ultimate objective being to dispense justice. in $$$$ there is a dis -cernable shift in the approach of the final courts in favour of rendering justice on the facts presented before them without abrogating but by -passing the principle of finality of the judgment. in union of india and anr. etc. vs. $$$ dead by lrs. etc. etc. $$$ / sc/06/8$$$ / sc/06/8 pathak cj. speaking for the constitution $$$ aptly observed but like all principles evolved by man for the regulation of the social order the doctrine of binding precedent is circumscribed in its governance by perceptible limitations limitation sarising by reference to the need for re -adjustment in a changing society a re -adjustment of legal norms demanded by a changed social context. this need for adapting the law to new urges in society brings home the truth of the $$$ian aphorism that the life of the law has not been logic it has been $$$ the common law p.and again when he declared in another study $$$ common carriers and the common law that clt 387the law is forever adopting new principles from life at end and"sloughing off old s at the other. explaining the conceptual import of what $$$ had said julius st elaborated that it is by the introduction of new extra -legal propositions emerging from experience to serve as premises or by experience -guided choice between competing legal propositions rather than by the operation of logic upon existing legal propositions that the growth of law tends to be determined julius st legal systems & lawyers reasoning pp.-. the concern of this court for rendering justice in a cause is not less important than the principle of finality of its judgment. we are faced with competing principles -ensuring certainty and finality of a judgment of the court of last resort and dispensing justice on reconsideration of a judgment on the ground that it is vitiated being in violation of the principle of natural justice or apprehension of bias due to a judge who participated in decision making process not disclosing his links with a party to the case or abuse of the process of the court. such a judgment far from ensuring finality will always remain under the cloud of uncertainty. almighty al is the dispenser of absolute justice -a concept which is not disputed but by a few. we are of the view that though judges of the highest court do their best subject of course to the limitation of human fallibility yet situations may arise in the rarest of the rare cases which would require reconsideration of a final judgment to set right miscarriage of justice complained of. in such case it would not only be proper but also obligatory both legally and morally to rectify the error. after giving our anxious consideration to the question we are persuaded to hold that the duty to do justice in these rarest of rare cases shall have to prevail over the policy of certainty of judgment as though it is essentially in public interest that a final judgment of the final court in the country should not be open to challenge yet there may be circumstances as mentid above wherein declining to reconsider the judgment would be oppressive to judicial conscience and cause perpetuation of irremediable injustice. it may be useful to refer to the judgment of the supreme court of united states in ohio power company 's case supra.in that case the court of claims entered judgment for refund of tax alleged to have been overpaid in favour of the tax payer. on the application of the government a writ of certiorari against that judgment was declined by the supreme court of united states in october. the government sought re -hearing of the case by filing another application which was dismissed in december. a petition for hearing was also rejected in may. however in june the order passed in december was set aside sua sponge of its own motion and that case was ordered to be heard along with other pending cases in which the same question was presented. in those cases the supreme court held against the tax payer and on the authority of that judgment reversed the judgment of the court of claims. learned members of the court in per curiam opinion rested the decision on the ground of interest in finality of the decision must yield where the interest of justice so required. learned members dissented and held that denial of certiorari had become final and ought not to be disturbed. learned members however did not participate. this court in harbans singh 's case supra on an application under $$$ of the constitution filed after the dismissal of special leave petition and the review reconsidered its judgment. in that case among others the petitir and another person were convicted under section of i.p.c. and sentenced to death. in the case of of the remaining convicts the supreme court commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment. while staying the death sentence of the petitioner a.n.sen j. in his concurring opinion noticed the dismissal of the petitioner 's special leave review petitions and the petition for clemency by the president and observed very wide powers have been conferred on this court for due and proper administration of justice. apart from the jurisdiction and powers conferred on this court under $$$ and of the constitution i am of the opinion that this court retains and must retain an inherent power and jurisdiction for dealing with any extraordinary situation in the larger interests of administration of justice and for preventing manifest injustice being done. this power must necessarily be sparingly used only in exceptional circumstances for furthering the ends of justice. in antulay 's case supra the majority in the -judge $$$ of this court set aside an earlier judgment of the constitution $$$ in a collateral proceeding on the view that the order was contrary to the provisions of the act of in the background of that act without precedent and in violation of the principles of natural justice which needed to be corrected debito justitiae. in supreme court bar association 's case supra on an application filed under $$$ of the constitution of india the petitioner sought declaration that the disciplinary committees of the bar councils set up under the advocates act alone had exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into and suspend or debar an advocate from practising law for professional or other misconduct and that the supreme court of india or any high court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction had no such jurisdiction power or authority in that regard. a constitution bench of this court considered the correctness of the judgment of this court in re vinay chandra mishramanu / sc/0/995manu / sc/0/995. the question which fell for consideration of this court was whether the punishment of debarring an advocate from practice and suspending his licence for a specified period could be passed in exercise of power of this court under $$$ read with $$$ of the constitution of india. there an errant advocate was found guilty of criminal contempt and was awarded the punishment of simple imprisonment for a period of weeks and was also suspended from practice as an advocate for a period of years from the date of the judgment of this court for contempt of the high court of allahabad. as a result of that punishment all elective and nominated offices / posts then held by him in his capacity as an advocate had to be vacated by him. elucidating the scope of the curative nature of power conferred on the supreme court under $$$ it was observed the plenary powers of the supreme court under $$$ of the constitution are inherent in the court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes. these powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties. these powers are of very wide amplitude and are in the nature of supplementary powers. this power exists as a separate and independent basis of jurisdiction apart from the statutes. it stands upon the foundation and the basis for its exercise may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing to prevent injustice in the process of litigation and to do complete justice between the parties. this plenary jurisdiction is thus the residual source of power which the supreme court may draw upon as necessary whenever it is just and equitable to do so and in particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law to do complete justice between the parties while administering justice according to law. it is an indispensable adjunct to all other powers and is free from the restraint of jurisdiction and operates as a valuable weapon in the hands of the supreme court to prevent clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice. in spite of the width of power conferred by $$$ the constitution bench took the view that suspending the advocate from practice and suspending his licence was not within the sweep of the power under the said $$$ and overruled the judgment in re.c.mishra 's case supra. in m.s.$$$ 's case supra the petitioner who was found guilty of forging signatures and making false statements at different stages before this court was inflicted punishment under section ipc in $$$$ vs. state of haryana manu / sc/0590/996manu / sc/0590/996. he filed an application under article of the constitution assailing the validity of that order. taking note of the complaint of miscarriage of justice by the supreme court in ordering his incarceration which ruined his career acting without jurisdiction or without following the due procedure it was observed that to perpetuate an error was no virtue but to correct it was a compulsion of judicial conscience. the correctness of the judgment was examined and the error was rectified. in the cases discussed above this court reconsidered its earlier judgments inter alia under $$$ and which confer very wide powers on this court to do complete justice between the parties. we have already indicated above that the scope of the power of this court under article as a court of record and also adverted to the extent of power under article42 of the constitution. the upshot of the discussion in our view is that this court to prevent abuse of its process and to cure a gross miscarriage of justice may re -consider its judgments in exercise of its inherent power. the next step is to specify the requirements to entertain such a curative petition under the inherent power of this court so that floodgates are not opened for filing a review petition as a matter of course in the guise of a curative petition under inherent power. it is common ground that except when very strong reasons exist the court should not entertain an application seeking reconsideration of an order of this court which has become final on dismissal of a review petition. it is neither advisable nor possible to enumerate all the grounds on which such a petition may be entertained. nevertheless we think that a petitioner is entitled to relief debito justitiae if he establishes violation of principles of natural justice in that he was not a party to the lis but the judgement adversely affected his interests or if he was a party to the lis he was not served with notice of the proceedings and the matter proceeded as if he had notice and(2 where in the proceedings a learned judge failed to disclose his connection with the subject -matter or the parties giving scope for an apprehension of bias and the judgment adversely affects the petitioner. the petitioner in the curative petition shall aver specifically that the grounds mentioned therein had been taken in the review petition and that it was dismissed by circulation. the curative petition shall contain a certification by a senior advocate with regard to the fulfillment of the above requirements. we are of the view that since the matter relates to re -examination of a final judgment of this court though on limited ground the curative petition has to be circulated to a bench of the senior -most judges and the judges who passed the judgment complained of if available. it is only when a majority of the learned judges on this bench conclude that the matter needs hearing that it should be listed before the same bench as far as possible which may pass appropriate orders. it shall be open to the bench at any stage of consideration of the curative petition to ask a senior counsel to assist it as amicus curiae. in the event of the bench holding at any stage that the petition is without any merit and vexatious it may impose exemplary costs on the petitioner. insofar as the present writ petitions are concerned the registry shall process them notwithstanding that they do not contain the averment that the grounds urged were specifically taken in the review petitions and the petitions were dismissed in circulation. the point is accordingly answered.
