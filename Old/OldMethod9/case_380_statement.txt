vikramajit sen j. the question which falls for consideration is whether the $$$ is entitled to claim pension even though he resigned from service of his own volition and if so whether his claim on this count had become barred by limitation or laches. the $$$ joined the services of the respondent corporation on.on the post of assistant administrative officer chartered accountant at the age of. he worked for years and months in the corporation before tendering his resignation on.owing to family circumstances and indifferent health presumably having crossed years in age. the request of the $$$ for waiver of the stipulated months notice was favourably considered by the corporation vide letter dated.and the $$$ was allowed to resign from the post of deputy general manager accounts which he was holding at that time. we shall again presume that the reasons that he had ascribed for his retirement viz. family problems and failing health were found to be legitimate by the respondent otherwise the waiver ought not to have been given. $$$ the central government in exercise of power conferred under section of the life insurance corporation act had notified the lic of india staff regulations and thereafter the life insurance corporation of india employees pension rules hereinafter referred to as pension rules which though notified on.were given retrospective effect from.. the pension rules provide inter alia that resignation from service would lead to forfeiture of the benefits of the entire service including eligibility for pension. on.that is post the promulgation by the respondent of the pension rules the $$$ enquired from the respondent whether he was entitled to pension under the pension rules which has been understood by the respondent as a representation for pension the respondent replied that the request of the $$$ can not be acceded to. the $$$ took the matter no further but has averred that in prompted by news in a $$$$ and $$$ of a high court and a tribunal he requested the respondent to reconsider his case for pension. this request has remained unanswered. it was in that he sent a legal notice to the respondent in response to which the respondent reiterated its stand that the $$$ having resigned from service was not eligible to claim pension under the pension rules. eventually the $$$ filed a special civil application on.before the high court which was dismissed by the single judge vide judgment dated.. the lpa of the $$$ also got dismissed on the grounds of the delay of almost years as also on merits vide judgment dated.against which the $$$ has approached this court. as regards the issue of delay in matters pertaining to claims of pension it has already been opined by this court in union of india v. $$$ / $$$ / sc//$$$$ scc that in cases of continuing or successive wrongs delay and laches or limitation will not thwart the claim so long as the claim if allowed does not have any adverse repercussions on the settled -party rights. this court held:. to summarise normally a belated service related claim will be rejected on the ground of delay and laches where remedy is sought by filing a writ petition or limitation where remedy is sought by an application to the administrative tribunal. of the exceptions to the said rule is cases relating to a continuing wrong. where a service related claim is based on a continuing wrong relief can be granted even if there is a long delay in seeking remedy with reference to the date on which the continuing wrong commenced if such continuing wrong creates a continuing source of injury. but there is an exception to the exception. if the grievance is in respect of any order or administrative decision which related to or affected several others also and if the reopening of the issue would affect the settled rights of parties then the claim will not be entertained. for example if the issue relates to payment or refixation of pay or pension relief may be granted in spite of delay as it does not affect the rights of parties. but if the claim involved issues relating to seniority or promotion etc.affecting others delay would render the claim stale and doctrine of laches / limitation will be applied. insofar as the consequential relief of recovery of arrears for $$$$ is concerned the principles relating to recurring / successive wrongs will apply. as a consequence the high courts will restrict the consequential relief relating to arrears normally to a period of years prior to the date of filing of the writ petition.emphasis is ours)we respectfully concur with these observations which if extrapolated or applied to the factual matrix of the present case would have the effect of restricting the claim for pension if otherwise sustainable in law to years previous to when it was raised in a judicial forum. such claims recur $$$$ and would not stand extinguished on the application of the laws of prescription merely because the legal remedy pertaining to the time barred part of it has become unavailable. this is too well entrenched in our jurisprudence foreclosing any fresh consideration. the issue which confronts us is whether the termination of service of the $$$ remains unalterably in the nature of resignation with the consequence of disentitling him from availing of or migrating / mutating the pension scheme or whether it instead be viewed as a voluntary retirement or whether it requires to be regarded so in order to bestow this benefit on the $$$ who had resigned after reaching the age of and after serving the lic for over years. the $$$ resigned from service under regulation of lic of india staff regulations which along with the other provisions of relevance is reproduced for facility of reference -section -terminationdetermination of service:. an employee other than an employee on probation or an employee appointed on a temporary basis shall not leave or discontinue his service in the corporation without giving notice in writing to the competent authority of his intention to leave or discontinue the service. the period of notice required shall be-(a months in the case of an employee belonging to class i;(b month in the case of other employees.provided that such notice may be waived in part or in full by the competent authority at its discretion. in case of breach by an employee of the provisions of the $$$ -regulation he shall be liable to pay the corporation as compensation a sum equal to his salary for the period of notice required of him which sum may be deducted from any mys due to him.superannuation and retirement:( an employee belonging to class i or class ii appointed to the service of the corporation on or after st $$$$ shall retire on completion of years of age but the competent authority may if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the corporation to do so direct such employee to retire on completion of years of age or at any time thereafter on giving him months ' notice or salary in lieu thereof.the following regulations on which learned senior counsel for the lic has placed reliance came to be introduced on.that is after the $$$ had resigned from service. we have called for and perused this notification and as we expected these provisions apply retrospectively with effect from.. these regulations ordain inter alia that an employee may be permitted to retire a on completion of the age of and after completing years in service. in other words the corporation has the power to compulsory retire an employee who has attained the age of years if in its opinion such decision is in the interests of the corporation and the employee may seek permission to retire upon completion of years of age and after rendering years of service. this very position finds reiteration in rule of the pension rules under the epithet ' voluntary retirement which pandect appears to have been available from the inception i...a notwithstanding what is stated in $$$ -rules and above an employee may be permitted to retire at any time on completion of the age after giving months notice in writing to the appointing authority of his intention to retire.notwithstanding the provisions of $$$ a an employee governed by the life insurance corporation of india employees pension rules may be permitted to retire at any time after he has completed years of qualifying service by giving notice of not less than days in writing to the appointing authority.provided that this $$$ -clause shall not apply to an employee who is on deputation unless after having been transferred or having returned to india he has resumed charge on the post in india and has served for a period of not less than year.provided further that this $$$ -clause shall not apply to an employee who seeks retirement from service for being absorbed permanently in an autonomous body or a public sector undertaking to which he is on deputation at the time of seeking voluntary retirement.the notice of voluntary retirement given under $$$ -clause i of $$$ b shall require acceptance by the appointing authority.provided that where the appointing authority does not refuse to grant the permission for retirement before the expiry of the period specified in the said notice the retirement shall become effective from the date of expiry of the said period. as we have already recounted the $$$ received a waiver of the requirement of giving months prior notice of his resolve to discontinue his service in the corporation bestowing legitimacy to the reasons that compelled him to do so. it also brings to the fore that the staff regulations did not provide for voluntary retirement or vrs as has become commonplace $$$$. this court has clarified and highlighted that resignation and retirement have disparate connotations that an employee can resign at any time but in contradistinction can retire only on completion of the prescribed period of qualifying service and in consonance with extant rules and regulations. we shall now consider the pension rules of. rule of chapter ii thereof provides that the rules are applicable to employees who were in the service of the corporation on or after.and had retired before.i. the notified date or who retired after.or who were in the service before the notified date and continued to be in service on or after the notified date or who were in the service on or after.but had retired on or after.and before the notified date. what is discernible from these dates is that the pension rules of have included classes of beneficiaries into homogenous class to wit the employees who had retired before the notified date and those who were to retire after the notified date. in our opinion the advantage of these beneficent rules should be extended even to the $$$ who was similarly placed as the retirees mentid in rule but for the fact that he had resigned rather than retired. the provisions caught in the crossfire are rule which defines retirement and rule which deals with the forfeiture of service": retirement means,-(i retirement in accordance with the provisions contained in sub -regulation or sub -regulation or sub -regulation of regulation of the life insurance corporation of india staff regulations and rule of the life insurance corporation of india class iii and class iv employees revision of terms and conditions of service rules made under the voluntary retirement in accordance with the provisions contained in rule of these rules.emphasis added). forfeiture of service -resignation or dismissal or removal or termination or compulsory retirement of an employee from the service of the corporation shall entail forfeiture of his entire past service and consequently shall not qualify for pensionary benefits.$$$ retirement noted in the sub -rule ii of rule has been defined in rule and it reads as follows:. pension on voluntary retirement-( at any time after an employee has completed years of qualifying service he may by giving notice of not less than days in writing to the appointing authority retire from service provided that this sub -rule shall not apply to an employee who is on deputation unless after having been transferred or having returned to india he has resumed charge of the post in india and has served for a period of not less than year provided further that this sub -rule shall not apply to an employee who seeks retirement from service for being absorbed permanently in an autonomous body or a public sector undertaking to which he is on deputation at the time of seeking voluntary retirement.the notice of voluntary retirement given under sub -rule shall require acceptance by the appointing authority provided that where the appointing authority does not refuse to grant the permission for retirement before the expiry of the period specified in the said notice the retirement shall become effective from the date of expiry of the said period.an employee referred to in sub -rule may make a request in writing to the appointing authority to accept notice of voluntary retirement of less than days giving reasons therefor;(b on receipt of a request under $$$ a the appointing authority may subject to the provisions of sub -rule consider such request for the curtailment of the period of notice of days on merits and if it is satisfied that the curtailment of the period of notice will not cause any administrative inconvenience the appointing authority may relax the requirement of notice of days on the condition that the employee shall not apply for commutation of a part of his pension before the expiry of the notice of days.an employee who has elected to retire under this rule and has given necessary notice to that effect to the appointing authority shall be precluded from withdrawing his notice except with the specific approval of such authority provided that the request for such withdrawal shall be made before the intended date of his retirement.the qualifying service of an employee retiring voluntarily under this rule shall be increased by a period not exceeding years subject to the condition that the total qualifying service rendered by such employee shall not in any case exceed -years and it does not take him beyond the date of retirement.the pension of an employee retiring under this rule shall be based on the average emoluments as defined under $$$ d of rule of these rules and the increase not exceeding years in his qualifying service shall not entitle him to any notional fixation of pay for the purpose of calculating his pension.it seems obvious to us that the $$$ 's case does not fall within the postulation of rule as the last categories or genres or types of cessation of services are in character punitive and the envisages those resignations where the right to pension has not been earned by that time or where it is without the permission of the corporation. the respondent corporation has vehemently argued that the termination of services is under regulation supra of the lic staff regulations and is not covered by the pension rules of. respondent corporation has controverted the plea of the $$$ that at the relevant date and time viz..there was no alternative for him except to tender his resignation pointing out that he could not have sought voluntary retirement under regulation of lic of india staff regulations. if that be so the respondent being a model employer could and should have extended the advantage of these regulations to the $$$ thereby safeguarding his pension entitlement. however we find no substance in the argument of the respondent since regulation was in fact notified in the gazette of india on.that is after the pension scheme came into existence with effect from.. otherwise there would have been no conceivable reason for the $$$ not to have taken advantage of this provision which would have protected his pensionary rights. we also record that the provisions covered by the definition of retirement which do not entail forfeiture of service are sub -regulation sub -regulation and sub -regulation of regulation of the life insurance corporation of india staff regulations and rule of the life insurance corporation of india class iii and class iv employees revision of terms and conditions of service rules. n of these provisions provides for voluntary retirement like rule of the pension rules nor does the definition of retirement make any mention of aforementid regulation. the facts of the case disclose that the $$$ has worked for over years and had tendered his resignation in accordance with the provision of regulation of lic of india staff regulations which as is apparent from its reading does not dissimulate between the termination of service by way of resignation on the hand and voluntary retirement on the other or distinguish from the other. significantly there was no provision for voluntary retirement at the relevant time and it was for this reason that the pension rules of specifically provided for it under rule. in this backdrop of facts we need not dwell much on the issue because the case of $$$ v. new india assurance co. ltd. $$$ / sc/086/$$$$$$$ / sc/086/$$$$ scc is on all fours of this case. in $$$ the $$$ resigned from the services of the respondent company after serving for over years on.. his resignation was offered and granted under clause of general insurance termination superannuation and retirement of officers and development staff $$$. $$$ the central government formulated general insurance employees ' pension $$$ with retrospective effect from.. $$$ applied for pension under this $$$ which was declined on the ground that resignation from service would entail forfeiture of service under clause of the general insurance employees ' pension $$$. the $$$ moved the high court challenging the rejection of his claim. his writ petition as well as the writ appeal was dismissed by the high court. the $$$ then moved this court whereby we noted that clause of the scheme of did not mention resignation nor was the $$$ made aware of the distinction between resignation and voluntary retirement that this distinction was a product of the general insurance employees ' pension scheme of. this court observed:0. sub -para of $$$ does not state that the termination of service pursuant to the notice given by an officer or a person of the development staff to leave or discontinue his service amounts to resignation nor does it state that such termination of service of an officer or a person of the development staff on his serving notice in writing to leave or discontinue in service amounts to voluntary retirement. sub -para of $$$ does not also make a distinction between resignation and voluntary retirement and it only provides that an employee who wants to leave or discontinue his service has to serve a notice of months to the appointing authority. we also notice that sub -para of $$$ does not require that the appointing authority must accept the request of an officer or a person of the development staff to leave or discontinue his service but in the facts of the present case the request of the $$$ to relieve him from his service after months ' notice was accepted by the competent authority and such acceptance was conveyed by the letter dated --of the assistant administrative officer indore.xxx3. the pension scheme was framed and notified only in and yet the pension scheme was made applicable also to employees who had left the services of respondent company before. $$$s and of the pension scheme quoted above were not in existence when the $$$ submitted his letter dated --to the general manager of respondent company. hence when the $$$ served his letter dated --to the general manager of respondent company he had no knowledge of the difference between resignation under $$$ and voluntary retirement under $$$ of the pension scheme. similarly respondent company employer had no knowledge of the difference between resignation and voluntary retirement under $$$s and of the pension scheme respectively. both the $$$ and respondent have acted in accordance with the provisions of sub -para of $$$ of the scheme at the time of termination of service of the $$$ in the year. it is in this background that we have now to decide whether the termination of service of the $$$ under sub -para of $$$ of the scheme amounts to resignation in terms of $$$ of the pension scheme or amounts to voluntary retirement in terms of $$$ of the pension scheme. para of the pension scheme states that the resignation of an employee from the service of the corporation or a company shall entail forfeiture of his entire past service and consequently he shall not qualify for pensionary benefits but does not define the term resignation. under sub -para of para of the pension scheme an employee who has completed years of qualifying service may by giving notice of not less than days in writing to the appointing authority retire from service and under sub -para of para of the pension scheme the notice of voluntary retirement shall require acceptance by the appointing authority. since voluntary retirement unlike resignation does not entail forfeiture of past services and instead qualifies for pension an employee to whom para of the pension scheme applies can not be said to have resigned from service. in the facts of the present case we find that the $$$ had completed years of qualifying service and had given notice of not less than days in writing to the appointing authority of his intention to leave the service and the appointing authority had accepted notice of the $$$ and relieved him from service. hence para of the pension scheme applied to the $$$ even though in his letter dated --to the general manager of respondent company he had used the word resign. what is unmistakably evident in the case at hand is that the $$$ had worked continuously for over years that he sought to discontinue his services and requested waiver of months notice in writing and that the said notice was accepted by the respondent corporation and the $$$ was thereby allowed to discontinue his services. if would examine rule of the pension rules juxtaposed with the aforementid facts it would at once be obvious and perceptible that the essential compnts of that rule stand substantially fulfilled in the present case. in sheelkumar this court was alive to the factum that each case calls for scrutiny on its own merits but that such scrutiny should not be detached from the purpose and objective of the concerned statute. it thus observed:. the aforesaid authorities would show that the court will have to construe the statutory provisions in each case to find out whether the termination of service of an employee was a termination by way of resignation or a termination by way of voluntary retirement and while construing the statutory provisions the court will have to keep in mind the purposes of the statutory provisions. the general purpose of the pension scheme read as a whole is to grant pensionary benefits to employees who had rendered service in the insurance companies and had retired after putting in the qualifying service in the insurance companies. paras and of the pension scheme can not be so construed so as to deprive of an employee of an insurance company such as the $$$ who had put in the qualifying service for pension and who had voluntarily given up his service after serving days ' notice in accordance with sub -para of para of the scheme and after his notice was accepted by the appointing authority. the $$$ ought not to be deprived of pension benefits merely because he styled his termination of services as resignation or because there was no provision to retire voluntarily at that time. the commendable objective of the pension rule is to extend benefits to a class of people to tide over the crisis and vicissitudes of old age and if there are some inconsistencies between the statutory provisions and the avowed objective of the statute so as to discriminate between the beneficiaries within the class the end of justice obligates us to palliate the differences between the and reconcile them as far as possible. we would be failing in our duty if we go by the letter and not by the laudatory spirit of statutory provisions and the fundamental rights guaranteed under article of the constitution of india. reserve bank of india v. cecil dennis solomon manu / sc/0/003manu / sc/0/003 scc relied upon by the respondent although distinguishable on facts has ventured to distinguish voluntary retirement from resignation in the following terms:10. in service jurisprudence the expressions superannuation voluntary retirement compulsory retirement and resignation convey different connotations. $$$ retirement and resignation involve voluntary acts on the part of the employee to leave service. though both involve voluntary acts they operate differently. of the basic distinctions is that in case of resignation it can be tendered at any time but in the case of voluntary retirement it can only be sought for after rendering prescribed period of qualifying service. other fundamental distinction is that in case of the former normally retiral benefits are denied but in case of the latter the same is not denied. in case of the former permission or notice is not mandated while in case of the latter permission of the employer concerned is a requisite condition. though resignation is a bilateral concept and becomes effective on acceptance by the competent authority yet the general rule can be displaced by express provisions to the contrary. in punjab national bank v. p.k. mittal manu / sc/0/18manu / sc/0/18 supp scc on interpretation of regulation of the punjab national bank regulations it was held that resignation would automatically take effect from the date specified in the notice as there was no provision for any acceptance or rejection of the resignation by the employer. in union of india v. $$$ manu / $$$ / sc/0370/$$$$ scc it was held in the case of a judge of the high court having regard to article of the constitution that he has a unilateral right or privilege to resign his office and his resignation becomes effective from the date which he of his own volition chooses. but where there is a provision empowering the employer not to accept the resignation on certain circumstances e.g. pendency of disciplinary proceedings the employer can exercise the power.emphasis is legal position deducible from the above observations further amplifies that the so -called resignation tendered by the $$$ was after satisfactorily serving the period of years ordinarily qualifying or enabling voluntary retirement. furthermore while there was no compulsion to do so a waiver of the months notice period was granted by the respondent corporation. the state being a model employer should construe the provisions of a beneficial legislation in a way that extends the benefit to its employees instead of curtailing it. the cases of shyam $$$ v. union of india manu / sc/06/$$$$manu / sc/06/$$$$ scc state of m.p. v. $$$ / sc/1/200manu / sc/1/200 scc m.r. prabhakar v. canara bank manu / sc/0822/$$$$manu / sc/0822/$$$$ scc national insurance co. ltd. v. $$$ / sc/002/$$$$manu / sc/002/$$$$ scc uco bank v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/0315/200 scc relied upon by the parties are distinguishable on facts from the present case. we thus hold that the termination of services of the $$$ in essence was voluntary retirement within the ambit of rule of the pension rules of. the $$$ is entitled for pension provided he fulfils the condition of refunding of the entire amount of the corporation 's contribution to the provident fund along with interest accrued thereon as provided in the pension rules of. considering the huge delay not explained by proper reasons on part of the $$$ in approaching the court we limit the benefits of arrears of pension payable to the $$$ to years preceding the date of the petition filed before the high court. these arrears of pension should be paid to the $$$ in instalment within weeks from the date of refund of the entire amount payable by the $$$ in accordance of the pension rules of. in the alternative the appellant may opt to get the amount of refund adjusted against the arrears of pension. in the latter case if the amount of arrear is more than the amount of refund required then the remaining amount shall be paid within weeks from the date of such request made by the appellant. however if the amount of arrears is less than the amount of refund required then the pension shall be payable on $$$$ basis after the date on which the amount of refund is entirely adjusted. the impugned judgments of the high court are set aside and the appeal stands allowed in the terms above. however parties shall bear their respective costs.
