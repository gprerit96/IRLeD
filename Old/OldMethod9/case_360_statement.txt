section of the commercial courts commercial division and commercial appellate division of the high courts act for short the act would not be applicable to an arbitration appeal. the high court noticed the language used in section of the act and the constitution of the forum under section of $$$ and opined that the submissions canvassed in support of the application for review were absolutely unsustainable. being of this view the division $$$ dismissed the application for review. as stated earlier both the orders have been challenged in these appeals by special leave. we have heard mr. anish kapur learned senior counsel for the $$$ and mr. balbir singh learned senior counsel for the respondent.  we shall refer to the decision in $$$ supra as the division $$$ in the impugned order has placed reliance on the same. in the said case the question that was posed reads as follows the only question which falls for consideration is whether intra -court $$$s on the original side of this court are maintainable of this court are maintainable in respect of suits or other proceedings which are filed on the original side of this court. to answer the said question the court referred to sections and of the act. the said provisions read as follows:. notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force or in any instrument having the force of law every application for the issue of any direction order or writ under article of the constitution of india and every application invoking the jurisdiction of the high court under article or article of the constitution of india pending before the high court of judicature at bombay on the date of commencement of this act or filed on or after the said date whether the matter in dispute is or has arisen in greater bombay or outside greater bombay shall be heard and disposed of by a division $$$ to be appointed by the chief justice of the high court provided that the high court may by rules made after previous publication and with the previous approval of the state government prescribe that such of the applications referred to above arising in greater bombay or outside greater bombay as may be specified in the rules may be heard and disposed of by a single judge appointed by the chief justice. notwithstanding anything contained in $$$ for the high court of judicature at bombay dated the 8th december and in any other instrument having the force of law or in any other law for the time being in force no appeal arising from a suit or other proceeding including the applications referred to in section instituted or commenced whether before or after the commencement of this act shall lie to the high court from a judgment decree or order of a single judge of the high court made on or after the commencement of this act whether in the exercise of the original or appellate jurisdiction of the high court. $$$ the high court referred to the constitution $$$ judgment in jamshed n. guzdar v. state of maharashtra and ors. $$$ / sc/006/$$$$$$$ / sc/006/$$$$ scc noted that before this court the counsel appearing for the state of maharashtra had found that there was anomaly in section of the act and accordingly made a concession which has been noted in paragraph of the judgment. it reads as follows mr. u.u. $$$ learned senior counsel for the state of maharashtra while supporting the impugned judgment submitted that there is an anomaly created by or deficiency found in section of the act inasmuch as section of the said act read with section of the act fails to make any provision for appeal against a decree or order passed after the commencement of the act in any suit or other proceedings pending in the high court since before the commencement of the act. he sought days ' time to have instructions from the state of maharashtra in this regard. $$$ on the basis of letter no. 7-pf dated --of the principal secretary and rla state of maharashtra ia no. is filed seeking permission to place on record the said letter indicating the willingness of the state of maharashtra to take necessary steps to make legislative amendment to section of maharashtra act of relevant portions of which read with reference to the above subject i have to state that you are hereby given instructions to make a statement before the hon'ble supreme court that the state of maharashtra will take necessary steps to make legislative amendment to section of maharashtra act of the maharashtra high court hearing of writ petitions by division $$$ and abolition of $$$s act to make a provision for appeal against the judgment order and decree passed on the appointed date by the high court and thereafter as may be indicated in the judgment of the supreme court. after the said judgment the state of maharashtra brought an amendment i.maharashtra high court hearing of writ petitions by division $$$ and abolition of $$$s amendment act maharashtra act no. xxvii of. the high court referred to statement of objects and reasons of the said amendment act and reproduced section which has come into existence after the amendment. interpreting section the division $$$ ruled that.. the words an appeal under any statute clearly referred to any appeal provided under any provision under the statute and where such an appeal is heard by single judge of the high court then against such orders passed in appeal by a single judge of the high court. appeals therefore provided under arbitration act and other acts which provide that these appeals are to be heard by the single judge of the high court then against the order passed in such appeals $$$ is not maintainable. here again a distinction will have to be drawn between the appeals which are filed from the orders passed by the district courts other than the orders passed by the single judge on the original side of the bombay high court. such appeals which are filed against the orders passed by the district courts would be heard by the single judge of this court and against such orders passed by the single judge of the high court $$$ appeal would not be maintainable. however where petition is filed before the single judge of this court under any provision under the statute the appeal against such an order would still be maintainable before the division $$$ of this court. this distinction therefore has to be kept in mind while construing the meaning of the words appeal arising from a statute. to give an example a petition under section of the arbitration and conciliation act where arbitral tribunal passes an award -say in the city of pune -such a petition under section of the act would be maintainable before the district court. an appeal under section would be maintainable in the high court before the single judge on the appellate side. no $$$ appeal against the order passed by the single judge under section can be filed before the division $$$ of this court whereas if the arbitral tribunal passes an award in city of mumbai a petition under section could be filed on the original side of this court and it would be heard by the single judge sitting on the original side of this court. appeal however against such an order would be maintainable before the division $$$ of this court and it would not be barred by the words appeal arising from a statute..be it noted that the division $$$ has referred to earlier judgment in jet air india ltd. v. $$$ / $$$ / mh/0/ scc online bom and concluded that an appeal arising out of any suit or proceeding which are filed on the original side would be maintainable in view of the amendment act of. the impugned order as we find placing heavy reliance on the aforesaid decision has opined that $$$ appeal is maintainable. the pivotal question is whether an appeal against the judgment of the single judge in an international arbitration matter is appealable to the division $$$ or to put it otherwise whether the intra -court appeal would lie because of $$$. in this context it is necessary to refer to section of the act which provides for appeals. it is extracted hereunder:. appealable orders.an appeal shall lie from the order refusing to--(a refer the parties to arbitration under section enforce a foreign award under section to the court authorised by law to hear appeals from such order.no appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the supreme court. on a careful reading of the aforesaid provision it is limpid that appeal can lie if an order is passed refusing to refer the parties to arbitration as engrafted under section of the act or to enforce a foreign award as envisaged under section of the said act. scheme of section came up for interpretation before this court in shin -etsu chemical co. ltd. and ors. v. vindhya telelinks ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/0474/$$$$$$$ / sc/0474/$$$$ scc wherein it has been ruled thus sections and in part ii of the act relating to enforcement of certain foreign awards correspond to sections and of part i of the act. $$$ -section of section provides for an appeal from an order refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section to the court authorised by law to hear appeal by such order. therefore the $$$ challenged the orders of the civil judge class i $$$ before the additional district judge $$$ which is said to be the court authorised to hear appeals from the orders of the civil judge class i. $$$ -section of section bars appeals. it provides that no appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under section. it however clarifies that nothing in section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the supreme court. in the said case a contention was advanced relying on $$$ -section of section that though an appeal may not lie from an order passed in appeal the right of appeal to the supreme court having been specifically stated the $$$ therein could maintain an appeal before this court. it was contended that the appellant had a right of appeal to this court. the -judge $$$ placing reliance on nirma ltd. v. $$$ $$$ and anr. $$$ / sc/060/$$$$$$$ / sc/060/$$$$ scc iti ltd. v. siemens public communications nerk ltd. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc shyam sunder agarwal and co. v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc and punjab agro industries corporation limited v. kewal singh dhillon $$$ / sc/87/$$$$$$$ / sc/87/$$$$ scc held:0. the right to appeal to the supreme court referred and excluded from the bar contained in section of the act refers to appeals under article or against any judgment decree or final order of the high court if the high court certified under article that the case involves a substantial question of law as to interpretation of the constitution or that the case involves a substantial question of law of general importance and that in the opinion of the high court the said question needs to be decided by the supreme court. the words right to appeal refer to a right conferred either under the constitution or under a statute to file an appeal to a higher court against the judgment decree or order of a lower court without having to obtain any permission or leave. in the absence of a constitutional or statutory provision for an appeal as of right the appellant can not contend that it has a right to appeal to the supreme court. an appeal by special leave to the supreme court can not therefore be considered as an appeal as of right or as an appeal in pursuance of a right to appeal to the supreme court. presently we may refer to the decision in p.s. sathappan dead by l.rs. v. andhra bank ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/087/$$$$$$$ / sc/087/$$$$ scc wherein the constitution $$$ was considering the maintainability of $$$ appeal that arose from the high court of madras. the court referred to various provisions of the code of civil procedure and certain clauses of $$$ applicable to the madras high court and also referred to $$$ of the letters patent of the bombay high court and held $$$$. we are of the opinion that in reaching this conclusion the court missed the relevant portion of $$$ of $$$ of the bombay high court. reliance can not therefore be placed on this judgment for the proposition that under $$$ of $$$ of the bombay high court no appeal to a division $$$ from the order of the single judge in exercise of appellate jurisdiction is maintainable. thus the unanimous view of all courts till was that section code of civil procedure specifically saved letters patent appeals and the bar under section did not apply to letters patent appeals. the view has been that a letters patent appeal can not be ousted by implication but the right of an appeal under $$$ can be taken away by an express provision in an appropriate legislation. the express provision need not refer to or use the words letters patent but if on a reading of the provision it is clear that all further appeals are barred then even a letters patent appeal would be barred.and again a $$$ is a special law for the high court concerned. the code of civil procedure is a general law applicable to all courts. it is well -settled law that in the event of a conflict between a special law and a general law the special law must always prevail. we see no conflict between $$$ and section but if there was any conflict between a $$$ and the code of civil procedure then the provisions of $$$ would always prevail unless there was a specific exclusion. this is also clear from section of the code of civil procedure which provides that nothing in the code shall limit or affect any special law. as set out in section code of civil procedure only a specific provision to the contrary can exclude the special law. the specific provision would be a provision like section. in $$$$ $$$ supra the -judge $$$ was dealing with the question whether an order though not appealable under section of the act would nevertheless be subject to appeal under the relevant provision of $$$ of the high court. in other words even though the act does not envisage or permit an appeal from the order the party aggrieved by it can still have his way bypassing the said act and taking recourse to another jurisdiction. to answer the said question the court referred to various decisions in the field and culled out the broad principles which are reproduced below:(i normally once an appeal reaches the high court it has to be determined according to the rules of practice and procedure of the high court and in accordance with the provisions of the charter under which the high court is constituted and which confers on it power in respect to the method and manner of exercising that power.when a statute merely directs that an appeal shall lie to a court already established then that appeal must be regulated by the practice and procedure of that court.the high court derives its intra -court appeal jurisdiction under the charter by which it was established and its powers under $$$ were recognised and saved by section of the government of india act section of the government of india act and finally by article of the constitution of india. the high court therefore can not be divested of its $$$ jurisdiction unless provided for expressly or by necessary intendment by some special statute.if the pronouncement of the single judge qualifies as a judgment in the absence of any bar created by a statute either expressly or by necessary implication it would be subject to appeal under the relevant clause of the $$$ of the high court.since section code of civil procedure specifically saves the letters patent appeal it could only be excluded by an express mention in section. in the absence of any express mention in section the maintainability of a letters patent appeal is saved by virtue of section.vi limitation of a right of appeal in absence of any provision in a statute can not be readily inferred. the appellate jurisdiction of a superior court can not be taken as excluded simply because a subordinate court exercises its special jurisdiction.vii the exception to the aforementid rule is where the special act sets out a self -contained code and in that event the applicability of the general law procedure would be impliedly excluded. the express provision need not refer to or use the words letters patent but if on a reading of the provision it is clear that all further appeals are barred then even a letters patent appeal would be barred. the court thereafter referred to section of the act and analysed the earlier decisions in the field including the judgment in union of india v. mohindra supply co. $$$ / sc/0004/6$$$ / sc/0004/6 air sc scr wherein it has been held that the $$$ appeal against an order passed by a single judge of the high court in appeal under section of the arbitration act was not maintainable in terms of $$$ -section of section of the said act. though appeal was held not maintainable in view of the express language employed in $$$ -section of section of the arbitration act the -judge $$$ took note of the observation which is to the following effect.. the proceedings relating to arbitration are since the enactment of arbitration act of governed by the provisions of that act. the act is a consolidating and amending statute. it repealed the arbitration act of schedule of the code of civil procedure and also clauses a to of section of the code of civil procedure which provided for appeals from orders in arbitration proceedings. the act set up machinery for all contractual arbitrations and its provisions subject to certain exceptions apply also to every arbitration under any other enactment for the time being in force as if the arbitration were pursuant to an arbitration agreement and as if that other enactment were an arbitration agreement except insofar as the arbitration act is inconsistent with that other enactment or with any rules made thereunder. relying on the said authority and also appreciating the decision of the constitution bench in p.s. sathappan supra the court ruled thus it is thus to be seen that arbitration act from its inception and right through to in p.s. sathappan was held to be a self -contained code. now if the arbitration act was held to be a self -contained code on matters pertaining to arbitration the arbitration and conciliation act which consolidates amends and designs the law relating to arbitration to bring it as much as possible in harmony with the uncitral model must be held only to be more so. once it is held that the arbitration act is a self -contained code and exhaustive then it must also be held using the lucid expression of tulzapurkar j.that it carries with it a negative import that only such acts as are mentid in the act are permissible to be d and acts or things not mentid therein are not permissible to be d. in other words a letters patent appeal would be excluded by the application of of the general principles that where the special act sets out a self -contained code the applicability of the general law procedure would be impliedly excluded. the ultimate conclusion reached by the court is to the following effect:90. we thus arrive at the conclusion regarding the exclusion of a letters patent appeal in different ways so to say on a micro basis by examining the scheme devised by sections and of the act and the radical change that it brings about in the earlier provision of appeal under section of the act and the other on a macro basis by taking into account the nature and character of the act as a self -contained and exhaustive code in itself. in light of the discussions made above it must be held that no letters patent appeal will lie against an order which is not appealable under section of the arbitration and conciliation act. in the case at hand the proceeding was initiated before the learned district judge. during the pendency of the proceeding the $$$ of $$$ -section of section of the act was amended. the amended $$$ reads as follows $$$ in this section and in the sections following in this chapter court means the high court having original jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject -matter of the arbitral award if the same had been the subject -matter of a suit on its original civil jurisdiction and in other cases in the high court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to such high court. in spite of the amendment the learned district judge passed an order. however the respondent moved the high court and it was accepted by both the parties before the learned single judge that the district judge had no jurisdiction and thereafter the learned single judge took up the matter and passed the order. the division bench in the impugned order has referred to section of the act. it reads as follows:3 any person aggrieved by the decision of the commercial court or commercial division of a high court may appeal to the commercial appellate division of that high court within a period of days from the date of judgment or order as the case may be provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed by a commercial division or a commercial court that are specifically enumerated under order xliii of the code of civil procedure as amended by this act and section of the arbitration and conciliation act. on a perusal of the aforesaid provision it is crystal clear that an appeal would lie if it is in accordance with the provisions of the act. the said provision has to be read in conjunction with section of the act. section of the act reads as under:. after issuing notification under $$$ -section of section or order under $$$ -section of section the chief justice of the concerned high court shall by order constitute commercial appellate division having or more division benches for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by the act.the chief justice of the high court shall nominate such judges of the high court who have experience in dealing with commercial disputes to be judges of the commercial appellate division. the aforesaid provision clearly lays down that a forum is created i.commercial appellate division. section of the act provides for an appeal. section has not been amended by the act that has come into force on.. thus an appeal under section of the act before the division bench is maintainable. thus analysed we find that the impugned judgment of the learned single judge under section of the act is passed in the original side of the high court. be that as it may under section of the act the single judge has taken the decision. section bars an appeal under $$$ unless an appeal is provided under the act. such an appeal is provided under section of the act. the letters patent appeal could not have been invoked if section of the act would not have provided for an appeal. but it does provide for an appeal. a conspectus reading of sections and of the act and section of the act which has remained unamended leads to the irresistible conclusion that a letters patent appeal is maintainable before the division bench. it has to be treated as an appeal under section of the act and has to be adjudicated within the said parameters. $$$ we affirm the judgment of the high court though for different reasons. accordingly the appeals stand dismissed without any order as to costs.
