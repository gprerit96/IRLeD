s. rajendra babu j. these petitions are offshoot of a $$$ framed by this court in $$$ etc. etc. v. director general of health services and anr. etc. etc.manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ prescribing the procedure to complete the process of allotment of per cent of all -india quota for admission to mbbs / bds courses in various colleges in the country by $$$$. the said $$$ was modified pursuant to an order made in i.a. no. of in wp{c no. of the dates fixed sic as indicated therein but we are not concerned with the same in thee proceedings. the last date for receipt of vacancy position is fixed as $$$$ and the iind round of counselling is proposed to be taken during the period fixed therein. now in these petitions it is contended that the iind round of counselling for the all -india quota seats which was scheduled to be held have neither been held as the pre -medical test pmt is not conducted nor counselling for the seats under the state quota is completed. this court in dr. pradeep jain and ors. etc. etc. v. union of india and ors.etc. etc.manu / sc/00/1manu / sc/00/1 and dr. $$$ and ors. v. motilal nehru medical college and ors.manu / sc/003/1manu / sc/003/1 while disapproving of the total reservation on different scores in regard to admission of students in medical courses such as mbbs and post -graduate specialities stated that the very mandate of the equality clause viewed in the perspective of social justice would justify some extent of reservation preferences for students passing the qualifying examination. the primary consideration in formulating the scheme for creating a reservation in favour of candidates is broadly based on national approach as against the state based reservation. this background resulted in the formulation of the scheme which is sought to be interpreted or modified now. we should not read the schemes framed by this court as if they are $$$ or that inexorable rights are conferred upon the parties. for the academic year -seats for mbbs course and seats for bds course totalling seats were made available by the states under the % all -india quota. on the basis of the results declared by respondent no. successful candidates were sent call letters. by $$$$ round of counselling seats remained un -filled to be allotted in the round. some states or colleges informed their vacancy position under % all -india quota from round of allotment amounting to seats. however some states have not intimated vacancy position even as late as.. it is submitted that the candidates from these states who have been allotted seats in the round of allotment may not have been given the course or college or place of their choice and sic they get the allotment of their choice under the state quota then they off vacate the seats allotted to them under the all -india quota. hence they apprehend that more than seats will fall vacant once the counselling is conducted in the aforesaid states. therefore it is submitted that a iiird round of counselling is required to be held and that the vacant seats if any should arise in the per cent all -india quota seats should not be allowed to revert back to the states / colleges after september and that instead successful and meritorious candidates in the all -india quota should be allotted these seats or such other orders as necessary may be passed. as per clause of the scheme if the $$$ or the principal of the concerned college does not notify the vacancy position due to non -joining of candidates or candidates in the round of counselling before the date indicated therein the seats allotted to the college will be treated as vacant and allotment of candidates will be made against these deemed vacant seats and it shall be the responsibility of the $$$ or the principal of the concerned college to give admission to those candidates. the iind round of allotment by personal appearance will be for candidates who were allotted a seat in the round and who wish to change their allotted college / course and wish to join the same against vacancies arising due to non -joining of the candidates allotted in the round of personal appearance and for candidates on the merit list who could not be considered for allotment in the round. it is thus the iind round of counselling by personal appearance was to be concluded by a particular date. when a detailed scheme has been framed through orders of this court and the manner in which it has to be worked out is also indicated therein we do not think that if in $$$$ there is any short fall or certain number of seats are not filled up the same should be d by adopting more round of counselling because there is no scope for the round of counselling under the scheme. it would not be advisable to go on altering the scheme as and when seats are found vacant. what is to be borne in mind is that broad equality will have to be achieved and not that it should result in any mathematical exactitude. out of about seats if seats are not filled up for various reasons we do not think it should result in the round of counselling. if that process is to be adopted then there will be again vacancies and further filling up of the seats falling vacant will have to be undertaken. in that process it will become endless until all the seats under the all -india quota are filled up. that is not the object of the scheme formulated by this court. the object was to achieve a broad based equality as indicated by us at the outset and we do not think that any steps have to be taken for altering the scheme. moreover this court in medical council of india v. madhu singh and ors.has taken the view that there is no scope for admitting students midstream as that would be against the very spirit of statutes governing medical education. even if seats are unfilled that can not be a ground for making mid -session admissions and there can not be telescoping of unfilled seats of year with permitted seats of $$$$. if these aspects are borne in mind we do not think any reliefs as sought for by the petitioners can be granted under these petitions. interlocutory applications filed shall stand disposed of in view of the order made by us in the main petitions. these petitions shall stand dismissed.
