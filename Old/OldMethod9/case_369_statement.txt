s.b. sinha j. leave granted in the special leave petitions. a common question as to whether an employee who opts for the voluntary retirement pursuant to or in furtherance of a scheme floated by the nationalised $$$ and the state bank of india would be precluded from withdrawing the said offer is involved in this batch of appeals which arise out of the judgments of various high courts. the state bank of india has been constituted under the state bank of india act whereas the other banks hereinafter referred to as the nationalized $$$ for the sake of brevity were taken over in terms of the provisions of the banking companies acquisition and transfer of undertakings act. hereinafter referred to as act. the banks were said to be over -staffed. for the purpose of effective management man power planning was contemplated by the ministry of finance government of india pursuant whereto and in furtherance whereof the government considered the desirability of introducing voluntary retirement scheme to help the banks to right -size their force. in a letter dated.the director ir & boii ministry of finance intimated to the concerned banks that different committees and experts opined the most of the banks have % surplus manpower. it was observed..while there is a need for inducting new workforce which had adequate knowledge of new skills such as modern technology foreign exchange venture capital e -commerce my management etc. it is also essential to rationalize the existing manpower. in doing so it has to be ensured that thee should be adequate opportunities for promotions for all and proper balance between promoted and direct recruit officers at entry level. sufficient prtrong omotional opportunities should be created for the entrants in non -executive grades by creating graded scales within the cadre and giving age relaxation and special coaching to enable them to compete for direct recruitment also. thus for entry in officers cadre % quota for promotion should suffice. that will enable banks to recruit % officers from open market in accordance with the needs of the banks to ensure continuous intake of persons with desired qualifications in accordance with the changing skill needs. it was therefore requested that the concerned banks should undertake the exercise of man -power planning on priority basis and send the same to the banking division for approval of the board. a committee was constituted by the central government for consideration of various issues as specified in the report of the committee on human resource management in public sector $$$. the said committee in its report inter alia observed:-".the committee feels that the high establishment cost and low business per employee are important contributory factors for the low profitability of several public sector banks. the committee feels that without right -sizing the staff it would be difficult for public sector banks to compete with other banks operating in the country and their profitability will remain under severe strain. optimizing the existing work force in also necessary to facilitate recruitment of personnel with specialised skills required for appropriate use of information technology in banking transaction compliance with prudential norms and consequent emphasis on improved risk management and assert liability management as also $$$ ' foray into new business areas such as insurance capital markets etc..different committees and experts have in $$$$ perceived excess staff in banks especially in the public sector banks. the ext of surplus may however differ from bank to bank. $$$ are at various stages of making a proper assessment of human resources including man -power planning exercise..the committee further reiterates that the government may consider rolling back the age of retirement for officers from years to years. this will not only reduce the man -power in the age group of to but will also result in considerable savings. pursuant to or in furtherance of the said purported policy decision the state bank of india as well as the nationalised $$$ adopted separately but almost identical scheme known as employees $$$ $$$. we may however observe that the scheme adopted by the state bank of india hereinafter referred by sbivrs in certain respects differ from the scheme of the nationalised $$$ hereinafter referred to the said scheme. for our purpose we would consider them separately. the said scheme was applicable in relation to employee who on the date of application had completed years of service or years of age. the employees specified therein including specialised officers were not eligible to seek voluntary retirement. however in certain scheme they were ordinarily ineligible for being considered. the period during which the said scheme was to remain operative varies from bank to bank. however as far as punjab national bank was concerned the said scheme was to remain in operation from.to.. in terms of the said scheme those who sought for voluntary retirement were entitled to -gratia payments as specified therein as also other benefits which are as follows:-"almost of ex -gratiaan employee seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme will be entitled to the -gratia amount mentid below in para a or whichever in less days salary pay plus stagnation increments plus special pay plus dearness relief for $$$$ of service;orb salary for $$$$ service left;other benefitsan employee seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme will be eligible for the following benefits in addition to the -gratia amount mentid in para above of this scheme gratuity as per payment of gratuity act or gratuity payable under the service rules as the case may be as per existing $$$$ pension including commuted value of pension as per pnb employee pension regulations.orb bank 's contribution towards pf as per existing rules.leave encashment as per existing rules. the $$$ contained an eligibility criteria namely that employees against whom disciplinary proceedings were contemplated or pending would not be eligible for seeking voluntary retirement. it states that the employees seeking voluntary retirement were eligible for all other retirement benefits. under the existing said scheme the bank his reserved with itself the right to withdraw the scheme at any time it thinks fit and its decision in this behalf was to be final. para of the said scheme specifies different compet authorities for accepting voluntary retirement of different categories of officers and workmen.the following general conditions now need be noticed:-".a mere request of an employee seeking voluntary retirement under the $$$ will not take effect until and unless it is accepted in writing by the compet authority.it will not be open for an employee to withdraw the request made for voluntary retirement under the $$$ after having exercised such option.the compet authority shall have absolute discretion either to accept or reject the request of an employee seeking $$$ under the scheme depending upon the requirement of the bank. the reasons for rejection of request of an employee seeking voluntary retirement shall be recorded in writing by the compet authority. acceptance or otherwise of the request of an employee seeking voluntary retirement will be communicated to him in writing.. an employee who would seek voluntary retirement under this scheme will not be eligible for re -employment in the bank or any of its subsidiaries.. the benefits payable under this scheme shall be in full and final settlement of all claims of whatsoever nature whether arising under the scheme or otherwise to the employee or to his nominee in case of death. an employee who voluntarily retired under this scheme will not have any claim against the bank of whatsoever nature and no demand or dispute or difference will be raised by him or on his behalf whether for re -employment or compensation or back wages including employment of any of his relative on compassionate grounds in the service of the bank or for any other benefit whatsoever.. the vacancy caused by voluntary retirement shall not be filled up by new recruitment.. the -gratia payable to an employee on opting for $$$ under this scheme would be paid to him within days from the date of his relieving.procedurean employee eligible to seek voluntary retirement under this scheme should make a request on the prescribed application enclosed with this scheme as annexure -a or annexure a- as the case may be through proper channel addressed to the compet authority before the last date prescribed under this $$$. further copy of the application be directly sent to the dy. general manager p at head office new delhi.annexure -a appended to the said $$$ is the former of an application for offer to seek voluntary retirement which reads thus:-"application for offer to seek voluntary retirement from the service of the bank.for workmen employees & officers upto scale -iii)the dy. general managerpersonnel divisionhead officenew delhi.through proper channel)sir sub voluntary

vide personnel division circular no. dated.which i have carefully read and understood the conts of the same. i accept the terms and conditions stipulated in pnb employees voluntary retirement $$$ -unconditionally and irrevocably. i furnished the required particulars in the appendix enclosed for consideration of my offer to seek voluntary retirement from the service of the bank under the above scheme.yours. a large number of employees employees approx.submitted their applications out of whom a small number of employees employees approx.withdrew their offer. despite withdrawal of their offer the same was accepted. in some cases offers despite withdrawal thereof were accepted within the period during which the scheme was operative and in some beyond the same. the scheme was introduced by the banks with the approval of the board of directors. questioning the action on the part of the banks in accepting the applications of the concerned employees despite their withdrawal writ petitions were filed in the punjab & haryana high court bombay high court uttranchal high court etc. before the punjab & haryana high court the legality or validity of the said scheme also came to be questid. writ applications were also filed by some employees seeking for issuance of writ of mandamus directing the respective banks to pay unto them their lawful dues strictly in terms of the scheme. the punjab & haryana high court by reason of its judgment impugned herein dated.inter alia held:-"that the v.r. $$$ as framed is not a valid piece of subordinate legislation inasmuch as the provision of section $$$ -clause and $$$ -clause of the act have not been complied with and has therefore to be set aside.even if it is assumed for the sake of arguments that the scheme is validly framed it would be open to an employee to withdraw his option before the same has been accepted and effectively enforced.for the reasons recorded above we allow writ petitions i. c.w.p. nos. of and c.w.p. nos. and of etc. etc. in which the petitirs have made a prayer for the withdrawal of their options and the impugned orders accepting the options of voluntary retirement stand quashed. all these petitirs shall be reinstated in service with all consequential benefits. it is however made clear that those petitirs who have received the benefits under the scheme including the -gratia payment whether with or without protest shall return the entire amount received by them with interest at the rate of % per annum from the date of the receipt of the said amount till the date of return. on return of the aforesaid amount the consequential benefits regarding the payment of arrears of salary and allowances from the date of their release to the date of reinstatement shall be given to them by the respondents. these petitirs shall also have the benefit of continuity of service and the interregnum period shall be regularised in accordance with law and regulations.since we have already declared this scheme as bad therefore we are not in a position to give any relief to the writ petitirs of writ petitions i. c.w.p. nos. and in our opinion these writ petitions are liable to be dismissed. when all rights flow from a valid scheme and the moment the scheme is declared bad on account of statutory restrictions then the petitirs of these writ petitions can not ask for any advantage or benefit.now we want to make some observations with regard to those employees who had taken the benefit under the vrs $$$ but they have not approached this court as they appear to be satisfied with the amount benefits already received by them. with regard to them we want to make it clear that the $$$ are not obliged to recall these employees for employment". the bombay high court and the other high courts on the other hand held that $$$.of the scheme or the scheme framed by the other banks is not operative as the employees have indefeasible rights to withdraw their offer before the same is accepted. in arriving at its aforementid finding the high court inter alia relied on the following decisions of this court in union of india and ors. v. $$$ chandra mishra and ors. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 $$$ v. union of india and anr. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 $$$ punjab national bank v. p.k. mittal $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ union of india and anr. v. wing commander t. $$$ $$$ / sc/09/00$$$ / sc/09/00 scc and $$$ v. project & development india ltd. and anr. $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0. assailing the judgment of the high courts mr. $$$. sorabjee learned attorney general for india inter alia submitted that having regard to the purport and object sought to be achieved by the scheme $$$.of the general conditions can not be said to be illegal as by submitting themselves thereto the concerned employees must be held to have resigned in present and in that view of the matter the contractual bar contained therein can not be held to be bad in law. the learned attorney general would urge that the high court proceeded on a wrong premise insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the scheme would amount to a regulation which would attract the provision of section of the act. it was submitted that power to fix the terms and conditions of service of their employees by the $$$ is provided for under section of the said act. the learned counsel would cond that it is not the case of the writ petitir -respondents that the aforementid $$$.is arbitrary or otherwise opposed to public policy or suffers from lack of mutuality and thus the high court must be held to have arrived at a wrong conclusion. such a clause being an offer the learned attorney general would cond is not violative of any provisions of the indian contract act or the constitution of india. taking us through the decisions of this court in $$$ supra t. $$$ supra $$$ supra as also $$$ supra the learned attorney general would urge that therein this court has laid down that such a provision leads to laudable object and only in absence of such a provision prospective resignation can be withdrawn before its acceptance. it was further submitted that as each of the employees had made un -revocable and unconditional offer of terms and conditions laid down in the scheme. they could not have withdrawn therefrom and particularly as some of them accepted the -gratia payment and thus they having elected for the scheme and thus were estopped and precluded from questioning the same. those employees mr. sorabjee would submit who accepted the -gratia payment could not have been permitted by the high court to approbate or reprobate. in support of the said contion reliance has been placed in brijendra nath bhargava and anr. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ $$$ v. shri radhey shyam $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ halsbury 's laws of england fourth $$$ volume para and american jurisprudence volume pages to. as regards the finding of the punjab & haryana high court that the scheme is ultra vires having regard to the fact that the same was not laid before the parliament as required under section of act it was conded that such a provision being directory failure on the part of the central government to lay the said scheme before the parliament could not vitiate the scheme itself. strong reliance in this connection has been placed in $$$ v. state of gujarat and anr. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ and atlas cycle industries ltd. and ors. v. the state of haryana $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9. it was urged that the entire scheme was offered to the employees as a package and the same had to be treated as such and in that view of the matter it being within the realm of contract statutory regulations can not be said to have any application whatsoever. mr. v.r. reddy who appeared for the punjab national bank in the matters arising out the judgment and orders passed by the bombay high court inter alia would submit that the high court erred in proceeding on the basis as if the employees are the government servants and enjoy a status. according to the learned counsel having regard to the provisions of the act the terms and conditions of services of the employees of the nationalised $$$ are governed by contract. mr. reddy would urge that the purpose of the scheme being down sizing of the employees the same was required to be considered having regard to the age profile skill profile the ext of the response received from the employees and several other relevant factors. in the aforementid situation the learned counsel would submit that $$$.was inserted to that in the event those who had opted for the scheme resile therefrom the banks may not face practical difficulties. the requirement of the bank the learned counsel would submit must prevail over the requirement of the individual employees. as regards the validity of $$$.the learned counsel would submit that the same was at the threshold stage leading to a major contract. strong reliance in this connection has been placed anson 's law of contract $$$ paras and$$$ on contracts $$$ pages -and -and halsbury 's laws of england $$$ volume para at page. mr. mukul rohtagi appearing on behalf of the bank of india would cond that as the writ petitions involved enforcement of contract qua contract they were not maintainable. the learned counsel placed strong reliance in $$$ and ors. v. the dy. excise and $$$. and ors. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9. dy. $$$ and mr. $$$ appearing on behalf of the state bank of india submitted that the high court completely misdirected itself insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the provisions of the state bank of india act materially differ from act. according to the learned counsel the terms and conditions of employment are governed under sections and of act. it has been pointed out that having regard to the difficulties which may be faced by some of the employees although the scheme dated.was to remain in force for a short time implementation thereof was contemplated in a time -bound manner i.opportunity to the employees to apply for voluntary retirement during the period.to.opportunity to the employees to withdraw if so desired by.employees whose request for voluntary retirement is accepted were to stand retired on.and paid accordingly. having regard to the difficulties which may be faced by some of the employees by a circular a cut -off date of.was fixed thereby granting opportunities to the employee to withdraw the option exercised by him. the logic and necessity therefore inter alia was the purpose of the sbivrs was inter alia to have overall reduction in the existing strength of the employees. however the bank were also required to control the outflow according to its requirements for which the bank retained the discretion to limit the number of employees allowed to retire.a decision was taken by the bank that around % employees may be allowed to retire under the vrs the petitir bank had to process the applications of all the employees who had opted for vrs. this ratio of % could be achieved only after the bank receives a definite figure about the number of persons opting for vrs and withdrawing later.further the final decision of the category of persons eligible under vrs could be taken only after the petitir bank had the final tally regarding the last and final figure of number of persons who had opted under the vrs.the scheme was purely voluntary and the conscious decision of the employee hence there could be no reason for his withdrawal of application at $$$$. however keeping in view the interest of the employee it was decided that the employee might be permitted to withdraw the application on or before..it was a time bound scheme whereunder the employee was to be relieved and paid entire mtary benefits by.for which arrangements were to be made. it has been pointed out that around employees had applied under the said scheme and around employees had withdrawn before the cut off date. around employees had been granted voluntary retirement under the scheme excluding the ineligible. it was conded that the scheme if read in its entirely would clearly show that the same was an offer and not an invitation to offer and in terms thereof an enforceable rights and duties had been conferred upon both employer and employee which would subject to certain exception be enforceable. it was conded that as the concerned employee did not exercise his option of withdrawal within the specified date namely.his case had been considered on the premise that he has not withdrawn his offer. the learned counsel would cond that a contract of employment can be terminated unilaterally even a ure of contract of employment can be curtailed by an agreement and in that view of the matter voluntary retirement scheme can not be said to be illegal. reliance in this connection has been placed on$$$ on contract ' paras -and -. mr. nageshwar rao learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents in civil appeal arising out of slp c cc no. inter alia would submit that the decisions of this court in $$$ supra and parathasary supra in no unmistakable terms laid down the law that an offer of resignation can be withdrawn before the same is accepted. according to the learned counsel the matter relating to the scheme is merely an invitation to offer and option pursuant thereto on the part of an employee would constitute an offer. such an offer the learned counsel would cond had been made by the concerned employee on dotted lines. in any event the learned counsel would submit that having regard to the provision contained in section of the contract act the concerned employee had an absolute right to withdraw the same before a concluded contract is arrived at. $$$.of the punjab national bank vrs is thus ultra vires section of the contract act. strong reliance in this connection has been placed on $$$ v. state of madhya pradesh and ors. $$$ / mp/00/9$$$ / mp/00/9 air9mp air9mp $$$ v. the state of assam and ors. $$$ / gh/000/$$$ / gh/000/ and $$$ v. district inspector of schools ghaziabad and ors. $$$ / $$$$$$ / $$$ j.t. sc. mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent in civil appeal arising out of slp c nos. -of would submit that the scheme formulated by other public sector banks including punjab & sind bank is identical to that of punjab national bank. according to the learned counsel the entire scheme has be read as a whole. it was pointed out that the scheme had a limited duration from.to.and a cumulative consideration of the relevant clauses would clearly show that the relationship between the master and servant comes to an end only upon acceptance of the offer. it was pointed out that the offer is required to be considered at the level of the branch manager and zonal manager and upon their recommendation the same was ultimately to be taken up by the personnel department will clearly go to show that irrevocable nature of option would be relevant only if the same culminates into an acceptance. the learned counsel would submit that mere declaration given by an offerer that he would not withdraw or cancel the offer would not destroy his locus. strongly relying upon the decisions of this court in j.n. srivastava v. union of india and anr. $$$ / sc//$$$ / sc// $$$ supra $$$ supra shambhu murari sihna supra $$$ supra the learned counsel would submit that even after acceptance the offer could be withdrawn such an action on the part of the optid is permissible even after the acceptance of the offer and in that view of the matter the application of contractual bar must be held to be applicable only in a case where offerer has been relevant from his part not prior thereto. the decisions of this court mr. $$$ would submit lay down the following principles juridical relationship of employer and employee continues till the employee is relieved from his duties it is a bilateral action offer being not in present -its acceptance is necessary only exception to the said rule would be where prejudice may be caused. mr. $$$ would urge that in the instant case it can not be said that the statutory regulation has nothing to do with the $$$ as pension was to be calculated in terms thereof. the learned counsel pointed out that after the offer had been made the concerned banks had issued a circular pursuant whereto or in furtherance whereof a proviso to regulation was sought to be added in terms whereof the concerned employees were deprived of the benefit of additional years of service towards qualifying service so as to get pension in terms of $$$ of regulation as thereby instead and in place of full pension the principle of pro -rata pension was introduced. such amendment in the scheme as a result whereof the employees were gravely prejudiced the concerned employees derived a legal right to withdraw from the said scheme. mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents in civil appeals arising out of slp c nos. -of would cond that the offending clause having been unilaterally prescribed would not amount to a contractual bar. such a contractual bar the learned counsel would submit must be based on consideration. a contractual scheme must not offend the fight of the employee under section of the indian contract act in terms of whereof the offerer is entitled to revoke his proposal / offer at any time before the communication of the acceptance. relying upon or on the basis of a large number of decisions by different high courts namely zoravarmal v. $$$ das $$$ / tn/0009/9$$$ / tn/0009/9 air mad secretary of state v. $$$ / $$$ / mh/00/9 $$$ $$$ v. provincial government $$$ / tn/0/9$$$ /

statutory rules governing the field section of the indian contract act would be attracted and in that view of the matter $$$.is neudum pactum and thus being a nullity is not enforceable. according to the learned counsel the terms and conditions of service of employees being governed by a statute or statutory regulations they enjoy a status. it was urged that as such voluntary retirement scheme affects the status of an employee a contractual bar can not be imposed. reliance in this connection has been placed on delhi transport corporation v. d.t.c. mazdoor congress and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/. in a case mr. $$$ would urge when the employee has voluntarily withdrawn the offer the doctrine of election will have to application as by reason thereof the employee has not received the benefit in part of the contract and then questid the rest thereof. mr. $$$ would inter alia submit that in some cases the letters of withdrawal reached before the option. in any event as the orders had been passed in many cases on.i. well after the expiry of the period of the scheme namely.the compet authority had no jurisdiction to accept the same. mr. $$$ appearing for the appellant in civil appeal no. of would draw the attion of this court to the fact of the matter and submitted that the concerned respondent had withdrawn his offer on $$$$ of filling his application but despite the same he had been relieved from his duties on.. the learned counsel would cond that the offending clause seeks to obliterate the right of the employee to which he would have been otherwise entitled to in terms of regulation and thus the same must be held to be illegal. reliance in this contraction has been placed in v.t. $$$ and ors. v. reserve bank of india and anr. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ )illjsc. mr. $$$ conded that by reason of the impugned judgment the uttranchal high court dismissed a writ petition filed by an employee inter alia on the ground that as he is bound himself by the terms not to withdraw the application for voluntary recruitment the writ petition was not maintainable. according to the learned counsel for the reasons stated by the punjab & haryana high court and bombay high court and the other high courts the said decision can not be sustained. mr. d. goburdhan appearing on behalf of the respondent -employee of the state bank of india would submit that his client who had completed years months of service had made the offer as he wanted pensionary benefits having regard to the circular issued by the indian $$$ ' association of which the state bank of india is manager namely that who had completed years of service may opt therefore but withdrew the same as he was informed that he would not get his pensionary benefits. mr. pradeep gupta appearing in civil appeal nos. -of on behalf of the concerned employees of allahabad bank would submit that as the respondent therein was working in a foreign exchange branch and having been doing a specialised job would not have ordinary come within the purview of the scheme. it was promoted out that his letter of withdrawal was strongly recommended by the branch manager but despite the same by reason of the writ petition the competition authority accepted the same without assigning any reason. the said order conds the learned counsel suffers from vice of non -application of kind inasmuch as in a case of this nature the concerned authority should have passed a speaking order. the learned counsel appearing in slp c cc no. would submit that the punjab & haryana high court had rejected writ petitions filed by the petitirs inter alia on the ground that as the scheme is ultra vires no relief can be granted in their favour. the learned counsel conded that as the scheme is contractual in failure the benefits which were otherwise available to them in terms of the scheme could not have been curtailed. before we advert to the rival contions we may take note of the relevant provisions of act.sections and of act read as follows:-" the general superindence direction and management of the affairs and business of a corresponding new bank shall vest in a board of directors which shall be entitled to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as the corresponding new bank is authorised to exercise and do. power to make regulations.the board of director of a corresponding new bank may after consultation with the reserve bank and with the previous sanction of the central government by notification in the official gazette make regulations not inconsist with the provisions of this act of any scheme made thereunder to provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this act.in particular and without prejudice to the generally of the foregoing power the regulations may provide for all or any of the following matters namely,:-(a........d.....the establishment and mainance of superannuation pension provident or other funds for the benefit of officers or other employees of the corresponding new bank or of the dependants of such officers or other employees and the granting of superannuation allowances annuities and pensions payable out of such funds:"9( every regulation shall as soon as may be after it is made under this act by the board of directors of a corresponding new bank be forwarded to the central government and that government shall cause a copy of the same to be laid before each house of parliament while it is in session for a total period of days which may be comprised in session or in or more successive sessions and if before the expiry of the session immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid both houses agree in making any modification in the regulation or both houses agree that the regulation should not be made the regulation shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect as the case may be so however that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously d under that regulation. pursuant to or in furtherance of the power conferred upon the bank under $$$ of $$$ -section of section of act the punjab national bank employees ' pension regulation was framed the relevant provisions being regulations and thereof read thus:-". superannuation pension superannuation pension shall be granted to an employee who has retired on his attaining the age of superannuation specified in the service regulations or settlements. pension on voluntary retirement

regulation and has given necessary notice to that effect to the appointing authority shall be precluded from withdrawing his notice except with the specific approval of such. it is not in dispute that on or about.a proviso to regulation was sought to be introduced which is as follows:-"provided that pension shall also be granted to an employee who opts to retire before attaining the age of superannuation but after having served for a minimum period of years in terms of any scheme that may be framed for the purpose by the bank 's board with the concurrence of the government"9. the said amendment however has been carried into effect recently in. the relevant portion of the sbi voluntary retirement $$$ is as follows:"sbi voluntary retirement scheme sbivrs). xx. objectives i. to have a balanced age profile providing for mobility training development of skills and succession plans for higher -level positions.ii. to provide an exit for employees who have an hst feeling that they

pursuant to in furtherance of the powers conferred under section the reserve bank of india with the previous sanction of the central government made the state bank of india general regulations. it is also not in dispute that in exercise of the power conferred under section of the state bank of india act the central board of the state bank of india made the state bank of india officers service rules determining the terms and conditions of the appointment and services of officers in the bank. following legal issues arise for determination in these appeals a. whether an application by an employee to secure voluntary retirement under the voluntary retirement $$$ vrs can be withdrawn by such an employee before the same is accepted by the compet authority thought he scheme contained in express stipulation that an application made thereunder is irrevocable and the employee will have no right to withdraw the application once submitted?b. whether upon making an application under vrs the employer bank secures the authority to unilaterally determine way or the other the jural relationship of master and servant between the parties?. the moot question which is required to be posed and answered is whether the voluntary retirement scheme is an offer / proposal or merely an invitation to offer. the question is whether the banks inded to make an offer or merely issued an invitation to treat is essentially a question of fact. as would appear from the discussions made hereinafter there appears to be some difference in the schemes floated by the state bank of india and the nationalized banks. we may consider the cases of nationalized bank . the circular dated.and the scheme framed by the banks are required to be read together for the purpose of ascertaining the true indment thereof. the scheme essentially was floated as has been mentid herein before with a purpose of downsizing the employees. such a scheme although may incidentally be beneficial also to the employees but was primarily beneficial to the banks. the ultimate aim and object of floating such a scheme as has been stated in the circular letter issued by the ministry of finance was for the purpose of effective functioning of the banks so as to enable them to complete with the private banks. the employees of the nationalized bank may not enjoy a status as is the case of government employees or the statutory authorities whose terms and conditions of service are governed by the constitutional provisions and/or the statutes and the statutory rules but there is no gainsaying that the employees of the nationalized banks enjoy security of their employment. so far as the employees of the state bank of india are concerned their terms and conditions of service as noticed hereinbefore are governed by statutory rules. however so far as the employees of the nationalized banks are concerned except for the matter of grant of pension which is covered by the regulations framed in terms of section of the act other terms and conditions of their service are not statutory in nature. but the state bank of india as also the nationalized banks are states within the meaning of article of the constitution of india. the services of the workman are also governed by several standing orders and bipartite settlements which have the force of law. the banks therefore can not take recourse to hire & fire for the purpose of terminating the service of the employees. the banks are required to act fairly and strictly in terms of the norms laid down therefore. their actions in this behalf must satisfy the test of articles and of the constitution of india. having regard to the indment of the scheme each and every employee would not be entitled to the benefit of the said scheme. those who are facing disciplinary proceedings or working in a particular class of employment are not eligible therefore. an offer indisputably can be made to a group of persons collectively which is capable of being accepted individually but the question which has to be posed and answered is as to whether having regard to the service jurisprudence the principles. of indian contract act would be applicable in the instant case. it is the specific case of the $$$ that the schemes had been floated by way of contract. it does not have any statutory flavour. reference to the pension scheme framed under the regulations was made for computation of the pension. it is difficult to accept the contion raised in the bar that a contract of employment would not be governed by the indian contract act. a contact of employment is also a subject matter of contract. unless governed by a statute or statutory rules the provisions of the indian contract act would be only applicable at the formulation of the contract as also the determination thereof. $$$ject to certain just exceptions even specific performance of contract by way of a direction for reinstatement of a dismissed employee is also permissible in law. it is in the aforementid backdrop the questions are required to be answered. it is now well -known that the use of the term offer or proposal is not decisive. it as noticed would depend upon the fact involved in the matter. in anson 's law of contract $$$n. at p. it is stated:"offers and invitations to treat it is sometimes difficult to distinguish statements of intion which can not and are not inded to result in any binding obligation from offers which admit of acceptance and so become binding promises. a person advertises goods for sale in a newspaper or announces that he will sell them by der or by auction a shopkeeper displays goods in a shop window at a certain price or a bus company advertises that it will carry passengers from a to z and will reach z and other intermediate stops at certain times. in such cases it may be asked whether the statement made is an offer capable of acceptance or merely an invitation to make offers and do business. an invitation of this nature if it is not inded to be binding is known as an invitation to treat. $$$ on contract states that law..a statement that goods are to be sold by der is not normally an offer to sell to the person making the highest der it merely indicates a readiness to receive offers. similarly an invitation for ders for the supply of goods or for the execution of works is generally not an offer even though the preparation of the der may involve very considerable expense. the offer comes from the person who submits the der and there is no contract until the person asking for the ders accepts of them. these rules may however be excluded by evidence of contrary intion.g. where the person who invites the ders states in the invitation that he binds himself to accept the highest offer to buy or as the case may be the lowest offer to sell or to provide the specified services. in such cases the invitation for ders may be regarded either as itself an offer or as an invitation to submit offers coupled with an undertaking to accept the highest or as the case may be the lowest offer and the contact is concluded as soon as the highest offer to buy or lowest offer to sell etc.is communicated.. in trietel 's the law of contract it has been stated thus:"when parties negotiate with a view to making a contract many preliminary communications may pas between them before a definite offer is made. party may simply respond to a request for information e.g. by stating the price at which he might be prepared to sell a house or he may invite the other to make an offer he is then said to make an invitation to treat. the question whether a statement is an offer or an invitation to treat depends primarily on the intion with which it was made. it has also been stated in the said book:"the question whether a statement is an offer or an invitation to treat depends primarily on the intion with which it was made. a statement is only an offer if the person making it inds to be bound as soon as the person reasonably believes that it was made with this intion. it follows that a statement is not an offer if it expressly provides that the person making it is not to be bound merely by the other party 's notification of assent but only when he himself has signed the document in which the statement is contained. the law relating to offer and acceptance is not simple. in $$$ $$$ and $$$ on contracts the learned authors referred to a decision of habaska seed co. v. harsh nob nw wherein the purported offer i want $.cent per cent for this seed fobcowell was held not be an offer on the ground that the defendant did not say i offer to sell you. at page of the said treatise it is $$$ rules of offer and acceptance are usually favourites of law students they are easily stated and d to be rather mechanical in their operation. they also involve situations that are relatively easy to grasp and in which various policy consideration are close to the surface. however should not assume that has mastered the law of contracts simply because sic conversant with rules of offer and acceptance. in deed the writings of modern contracts scholars d to depreciate the importance of the rules of offer and acceptance. see generally g gilmore the death of contract l. $$$ contract law in america. in halsbury 's laws of england $$$ition volume-9 meaning of offer has been stated in paragraph. at page in the following terms:"7 meaning of offer. an offer is an expression by person or group of persons or by agents on his behalf made to another of his willingness to be bound to a contract with that other on terms either certain or capable of being rendered contain. an offer may be made to an individual or to a group of persons or to the world at large. it may be made expressly by words or it may be implied from the product of the offerer. the request of employees seeking voluntary retirement was not to take effect until and unless it was accepted in writing by the compet authority. the compet authority had the absolute discretion whether to accept or reject the request of the employee seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme. a procedure has been laid down for considering the provisions of the said scheme to the effect that an employee who inds to seek voluntary retirement would submit duly completed application in duplicate in the prescribed from marked offer to seek voluntary retirement and the application so received would be considered by the compet authority on come serve basis. the procedure laid down therefore suggests that the applications of the employee would be an offer which could be considered by the bank in terms of the procedure laid down therefore. there is no assurance that such an application would be accepted without any consideration. acceptance or otherwise of the request of an employee seeking voluntary retirement is required to be communicated to him in writing. this clause is crucial in view of the fact that therein the acceptance or rejection of such request has been provided. the decision of the authority rejecting the request is applicable to the appellate authoirty. the application made by an employee as an offer as well as the decision of the bank thereupon would be communicated to the respective general managers. the decisions making process shall take place at various levels of the banks. the following therefore can be $$$ the banks treated the application from the employees as an offer which could be accepted or rejected.acceptance of such an offer is required to be communicated in writing.the decision making process involved application of mind on the part of several authorities.decision making process was to be formed at various levels.the process of acceptance of an offer made by an employee was in the discretion of compet authority.vi the request of voluntary retirement would not take effect in praesenti but in future.vii the bank reserved its right to alter / rescind the conditions of the scheme. from what has been noticed before it is apparent that the nationalized banks in terms of the scheme had secured for themselves an unfettered and unguided right to deal with the jural relationship between themselves and their employees. it is not a case where on mere making of opinion on the part of the employee the offer is to be accepted or even there will be reasonable certainty that some norms should be maintained. there is no consideration for the contractual bar clause. the submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the banks that the proposal to the effect that the option made by an employee would be considered is a consideration can not be accepted. once it is held that the provisions of indian contract act. would be applicable the scheme admittedly being contractual in nature the provisions of the act shall apply. the $$$ having regard to its provisions as noticed hereinbefore would merely constitute invitation to treat and not an offer. a proposal is made when person signifies to another his willingness to do or obtain from doing anything with a view to obtaining the assent of the other to such act or abstinence see section. $$$ the banks by reason of the scheme or otherwise have not expressed their willingness to do or abstain from doing anything with a view to obtaining assent of the employees to such act. it will bear repetition to state that not only the power of the bank to accept or reject such application is absolutely discretionary it as noticed therein before could also amend or rescind the scheme. the $$$ therefore can not be said to be an offer which on the acceptance by the employee would fructify in a concluded contract. the proposal of the employee when accepted by the bank would constitute a promise within the meaning of section of the act. only them the promise become an enforceable contract. in the instant case the banks when floating the scheme did not signify that on the employees assenting thereto a concluded contract would come into being in terms whereof they would be permitted to retire voluntarily and get the benefits thereunder. furthermore in terms of the said scheme no consideration passed so as to constitute an agreement. once it is found that by giving their option under the scheme the employees did not derive an enforceable right the same in absence of any consideration would be void in terms of section of the contract act as opposed to section thereof. furthermore even by opting for the scheme as floated by the banks no consideration is passed far less amounting to reciprocal promise. once it is found as would appear from the position rendered by this court that the employees do not have an enforceable right upon making an option the same would be void in terms of section of the contract act as opposed to section thereof. the distinction between an offer and invitation to treat has been dealt with some clarity in $$$ v. manchester city council reported in all. e.r.. in that case the council adopted a policy of selling council 's house to mr. $$$. the council wrote a letter to mr. $$$ that it may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price of pounds less % = pounds free hold. he was invited to make a formal application which he did. before the documents could be executed the control of the council changed hands as a result whereof policy of selling the council house was reversed. when it was claimed by mr. $$$ that the transaction amounted to a binding contract the house of lords negativing the same held that the letter in question was an invitation to treat and mr. $$$ 's application was an offer and not an acceptance. in the instant case there was even no reasonable certainty that the scheme would be acted upon. furthermore terms and conditions thereof could be amended and even the scheme itself could be rescinded. we therefore have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the voluntary scheme was not a proposal or an offer but merely an invitation to treat and the applications filed by the employees constituted offer. once the application filed by the employees is held to be an offer section in absence of any other independent binding contract or state or statutory rules to the contrary would come into play. in cheshire fifoot & furmston 's law of contract edition at page the law stated as under:-"it has been established ever since the case of payne v cave in that reconvention is possible and effective & any time before acceptance up to this moment hypothesis no legal obligation exits. nor as the law stands is it relevant that the offeror has declared himself ready to keep the offer open for $$$$. such an intimation is but part and parcel of the original offer which must stand or fall as a whole. the offeror may of course bind himself by a separate and specific contract to keep the offer open but the offeree if such is his allegation must provide all the elements of a valid contract including assent and consideration. in routleged v. grant the defendant offered on march to buy the plaintiff 's house for a certain sum a definite answer to be given within weeks from the date. best cj held that the defendant could withdraw at any moment before acceptance even though the time limit had not expired. the plaintiff could only have held the defendant to his offer throughout the period if he had bought the option by a separate and binding contract. this principles as noticed herein before has been accepted in a large number of decisions relied upon by mr. nageshwar rao and mr. $$$ supra. we may however only refer to $$$ supra. the relevant rule interpretation whereof fell for consideration of this court therein is as under:"these rules shall be applicable to the teachers of those state government aided higher secondary schools which are working under any local body or any non administrative management within the ambit of salary disbursement act on 30th june of thereafter and who will give their option in favour of retirement at the page of years within months of the publication of these rules. an option once used will be deemed to be final. the date of retirement shall be the end of session. interpreting the said rule this court held:"we are of the view that the high court should have rejected the writ application. it has not been disputed anywhere that option stood withdrawn before it was accepted. the provision in the rule an option once used will be deemed to be final would not mean that when an offer made it is not open to be withdrawn before it is accepted. the respondent no. obviously acted under the wrong notion and the high court did not appreciate this aspect. we would accordingly hold that the appellant was entitled to withdraw the option. we may at once point out that the stands of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of banks in inconsist and self -contradictory. whereas once it was argued that the offer was made by the bank by floating the scheme and once an application is filed the same would amount to acceptance of offer on the same breath they took recourse to the doctrine of option which is applicable only at the instance of the offeror who is this case would be the employees. the submission in our considered opinion proceed on a total misconception. by reason of making such option or firm offer the offeror must get some benefit or the offeree must incur some detriment. the contracts in which the said principle can be applied would be a case where there would usually be a my payment. in the instant case apart from the fact that no consideration is passed the banks standing in the category of offeree either expressly or impliedly had not promised to do or refrain from doing something in exchange for the offeror 's promise not to revoke the offer. in all fairness to mr. reddy we may set out hereunder the authorities relied upon by him. in anson 's law of contract edition page it is stated:"firm offers it will be noted that in offord v. davies discussed above the mere fact that the defendants promised to guarantee payment for months did not preclude that from revoking before that period had elapsed. it is a rule of english law that a promise to keep an offer open needs consideration to make it binding and would thus only become so if the offeror gets some benefit or the offeree incurs some detriment in respect of the promise to keep the offer open. the offeree in such a case is said to purchase an option that is the offeror in consideration usually of a my payment sometimes nominal makes a separate contract not to revoke the offer during a stated period. the position is similar where the offeree expressly or impliedly promises to do or refrain from doing something in exchange for the offeror 's promise not to revoke the offer. for example the offeree may promise not to negotiate with any else for a fixed period. again a building dering for a construction contract may have invited quotations for a fixed period i. firm offers from electricity or carpentry sub -contractors and expressly or impliedly promised to use the figures contained in those offers in its der. in these cases the offeror by its promise precludes itself from exercising its right to revoke the offer but where it receives no consideration for keeping the offer open it says in effect you may accept within such and such a time but this limitation is entirely for my benefit and i make no binding promise not to revoke my offer in the meantime. the law revision committee recommended that an agreement to keep an offer open for a definite period of time or until the occurrence of some specified event shall not be unenforceable by reason of the absence of consideration. despite this criticism subject to exceptions it seems to be good law. in chitty on contract it is stated:"firm offers. by a firm offer is meant containing a promise not to revoke it for a specified time. the mere fact that such a promise has been made does not prevent the offeror from revoking the offer within that period since normally the promise will be unsupported by consideration. most obviously such consideration will be provided if the offeree pays or promises to pay a sum of my for the promise and so buys an option. consideration may also be provided by some other promise for example in the case of an offer to sell a house the offeree may provide consideration for the offeror 's promise not to revoke the offer for a specified time by promising not to dispose of those shares elsewhere during that time. the performance of the offeree 's promise to keep the offer open. in case a vendor of land entered into a so -called lock -out agreement by which he promised a prospective purchaser not to consider other offers if that purchaser would exchange contracts within weeks and it was said that the promise by the purchase to get on by limiting himself to just weeks constituted consideration for the vendor 's promise not to consider other offers. the case is not strictly of a firm offer since the vendor 's promise would not in terms have prevented him from simply deciding not to sell at all but the practical effect of a binding lock -out agreement may be to prevent the vendor from withdrawing his offer and the reasoning quoted above could apply to the case of a firm offer. the reasoning gives rise to some difficulty in that it does not appear that the purchaser made any promise to exchange contracts within weeks. it seems more plausible to say that the vendor 's promise had become binding as a unilateral contract under which the purchaser had provided consideration by actually making efforts to meet the deadline even though he had not promised to do so. similar reasoning can apply if a seller of land promises to keep an offer open for $$$$ asking the buyer during that period to make efforts to raise the necessary my. if the buyer makes such efforts without promising to do so it is arguable that he has by part performance accepted the seller 's offer of a unilateral contract to keep the principal offer open. similarly it is possible for a person to whom a promise not to revoke an offer for the sale of a house has been made to provide consideration for that promise by incurring the expense of a survey. on the other hand the equitable principle applied in hughes v. metropolitan ry. and in the high trees case will not avail the offeree sine it only operates defensively and does not create new causes of action where n existed before. nor does it seems probably that the offeree will be able to claim damages in tort under the principles laid down in headley byne & co. ltd. v. heller & partners ltd. in halsbury 's laws of england $$$.para at page the law is stated as under:"3. options. a contract of option is whereby the grantor of the option offers to enter into what may be called a major contract with a person and makes a separate contract to keep his offer open. usually but not necessarily the person to whom the grantor of the option binds himself to keep the offer open is that person who may be conveniently referred to as the option -holder. the contract of option may make it possible for the rights of the option -holder to be assigned.the contract of option may be unilateral or bilateral. it may exist either as a separate option contract or as part of a larger contract such as of the following a lease with an option in the lessee to renew the lease or but the reversion a hire purchase agreement a sale with an option of repurchase granted to either the seller or the buyer a sale with an option for the buyer to make further purchases on similar terms a service or agency agreement with an option in either party to renew. certain contracts of option have been made void or illegal by statute.with regard to the envisaged major contract the effect of the contract of option is to create an irrevocable offer and a power of acceptance. the offer is irrevocable in the sense that it is a breach of the contract of option to revoke it and its effect is to create a power of acceptance in the option -holder good against the grantor of the option and sometimes also against parties. thus the grantor of the option is under a conditional duty and the option -holder has a conditional right of performance of the option offer that condition being the exercise of the power of acceptance by the option -holder as the envisaged major contract may be bilateral or unilateral that condition may be an acceptance or other act by the option -holder. furthermore the exercise of the option may itself be subject to certain condition precedent such as a time limit or the occurrence of a certain event or the duration of a major contract of which it forms a part or the mode in which it may be exercised. in chitty on contract edition para -it is stated that the position being uncertain as the rule can still cause hardship a legislation limiting the right to withdraw firm offers is desirable. in anson 's law of contracts it is stated at page revocation of the offer the law relating to the revocation of an offer may be summed up in rules an offer may be revoked at any time before acceptance and an offer is made irrevocable by acceptance.revocable before acceptance the of these rules may be illustrated by the case of offord v. davies d made a writ offer to o that if he would discount bills for another firm they d would guarantee the payment of such bills to the ext of pound during a period of calendar months. some bills were discounted by o and duly paid but before the months had expired d the guarantors revoked their offer and notified o that they would guarantee no more bills o continued to discount bills some of which were not paid and then sued d on the guarantee.it was held that the revocation was a good defence to the action. the alleged guarantee was an offer for a period of months of promises for acts of guarantees for discounts. each discount turned the offer into a promise pro tanto but the entire offer could at any time be revoked except as regards discounts made before notice of revocation. the learned author as noticed from the passage quoted herein before clearly stated that an offer may be revoked even before it is accepted. furthermore a large number of employees have withdrawn their offer only when a proviso is sought to be added to regulation aforementid. in terms of the $$$ the employees who expected to get benefits of clause of regulation would be deprived therefrom. it is not in this dispute that the qualifying period for pension qualifying for receiving pension was years. only upon completion of years in terms of the statutory regulation contained in regulation an employee could opt for voluntary retirement and in terms thereof he would be entitled to the benefits specified therein. the said regulations had specifically been mentid for the purpose of computation which would include invocation of $$$ -regulation of regulation providing for relaxation of years towards the qualifying period. the employees must have proceeded on the basis that despite the fact that they have merely rendered years of service which was not a qualifying service under the regulations they would be entitled to the pensionary benefits in terms of the scheme. by introducing the proviso to regulation pension was sought to be made pro rata in place of full pension. the basic concept of the scheme therefore underwent a change which also goes to show that the banks had sought to invoke its power of amending the scheme. once the scheme is amended and or an apprehension is created in the mind of the employees that they would not even receive the entire benefits as envisaged under the scheme they were entitled to revoke their offers. their action in our considered opinion is reasonable. it may be that some of the employees only opted for the provident fund benefit which did not undergo any amendment but the same would not change the attitude on the part of the banks. we therefore do not find any error in the judgment of the high court on this score. however the case of the state bank of india stand slightly on a different footing. firstly the state bank of india had not amended the scheme. it as noticed here before even permitted withdrawal of the applications after $$$$. the scheme floated by the state bank of india contained a clause clause laying down the mode and manner in which the application for voluntary retirement shall be considered. the relevant clause as referred to herein before creates an enforceable right. in the event the state bank failed to adhere to its preferred policy the same could have been specifically enforced by a court of law. the same would therefore amount to some consideration. furthermore in the case of state bank of india the punjab and haryana high court failed to take into consideration the provisions of the state bank of india act. it further failed to take into consideration that the matter relating to grant of pension was not covered by any statutory regulation. we are however not prepared to accept the submission of mr. salve to the effect that by reason of the said scheme merely the ure of service has been curtailed to some ext which is permissible in law. mr. $$$ in support of its contion has relied upon para -from chitty on contracts. the said paragraph itself shows that for bringing into a change in the ure of contract the existing contract of service must be substituted or amended by another contract. the later contract also must be an enforceable contract. once it is held the later contract is not a contract within the meaning of the provisions of the indian contract act the question of invoking this aforementid principle would not arise. we may at this juncture notice the decisions of this court covering the subject. in gopal chandra misra 's case supra this court was considering a question where a judge of a high court in terms of article of the constitution of india withdraw the resignation submitted by him. resignation by a constitutional authority is a unilateral act. in the case of resignation by a constitutional authority it is governed by the constitutional provisions as resignation of a constitutional authority does not require an express acceptance. the same being unilateral in character it was observed:"the substantive body of this letter which has been extracted in full in a foregoing part of this judgment is comprised of sences only. in the sence it is stated i beg to resign my office as judge high court of judicature at allahabad. had this sence stood al or been the only cont to his letter it would operate as a complete resignation in praesenti involving immediate relinquishment of the office and termination of his ure as judge. but this is not so. the sence is immediately followed by more which read i will be on leave till july. mr resignation shall be effective on august. the sence can not be divorced from the context of the other sences and construed in isolation. it has to be read along with the succeeding which qualify it. construed as a whole according to its or the letter dated may is merely an intimation or notice of the writer 's intion to resign his office as judge on $$$$ viz.august. in that case thus a resignation which was not in praesenti has been held to be capable of being withdrawn. it did not constitute a juristic act. we may notice that in $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/013/$$$ / sc/013/ airsc8 it was held:"it may be conceded that it is open to a servant who has expressed a desire to retire from service and applied to his superior officer to give him the requisite permission to change his mind subsequently and ask for cancellation of the permission thus obtained but he can be allowed to do so as long as he continues in service and not after it has terminated. yet again in $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/0180/68$$$ / sc/0180/68 it was held:"when a public servant has invited by his letter of resignation determination of his employment his services normally stand terminated from the date on which the letter of resignation is accepted by the appropriate authority and in the absence of any law or rule governing the conditions of his service to the contrary it will not be open to the public servant to withdraw his resignation after it is accepted by the appropriate authority. till the resignation is accepted by the appropriate authority in consonance with the rule governing the acceptance the public servant concerned has locus poenitiae but not thereafter. in balram gupta 's case this court was dealing with central civil services pension rules which is a statutory rule. $$$ -rule of rule prevented withdrawal of resignation letter except with the approval of the authority. the validity of the said rule was not in question. in that case the approval of the authority to withdraw was not given. it was in the aforementid situation observed:"that has been d. the approval of the authority was however not given. therefore the normal rule which prevails in certain cases that a person can withdraw his resignation before it is effective would not apply in full force to a case of this nature because here the government servant can not withdraw except with the approval of such authority. having regard to the fact that the issue involved therein stood on a different footing this court made a mere observation to the following effect:"it may be a salutary requirement that a government servant can not withdraw a letter of resignation or of voluntary retirement at his sweet will and put the government into difficulties by writing letters of resignation or retirement and withdrawing the same immediately without rhyme or reason. therefore for the purpose of appeal we do not propose to consider the question whether sub -rule of rule of the pension rules is valid or not. validity of such a rule was therefore not in question. as indicated hereinbefore the bar of withdrawing the resignation was contained in the statutory rule and thus section of the indian contract act would not have been applicable in that case. however it is advantageous to notice the following observations made in the said decision:"we do not see how this could not be a good and valid reason. it is true that he was resigning and in the notice for resignation he had not given any reason except to state that he sought voluntary retirement. we see nothing wrong in this. in the modern age we should not put embargo upon people 's choice or freedom. if however the administration had made arrangements acting on his resignation or letter of retirement to make other employee available for his job that would be another matter but the appellant 's offer to retire and withdrawal of the same happened in such quick succession that it can not be said that any administrative set up or arrangement was affected.it was further observed:"in the modern and uncertain age it is very difficult to arrange 's future with any amount of certainty a certain amount of flexibility is required and if such flexibility does not jeopardize government or administration administration should be graceful enough to respond and acknowledge the flexibility of human mind and attitude and allow the appellant to withdraw his letter of retirement in the facts and circumstances of this case. in p.k. mittal 's case supra a question arose as to whether in contravention of rule of the punjab national bank officers service rules the bank can reduce the notice period. $$$ j. speaking for the bench held that the same could not have been d and the concerned employee was entitled to withdraw his resignation before it became effective.in power finance corporation ltd. v. $$$ / sc/6/97$$$ / sc/6/97 a scheme of voluntary retirement was floated and pursuant thereto the respondent therein has applied for voluntary retirement but subsequently the corporation had withdrawn the scheme although the offer had been accepted. such acceptance was to take effect from --. this court held that the acceptance of his offer to voluntarily retire being subject to adjustment of the amount payable to him the same did not attain finality. it was held:"it is now settled legal position that unless the employee is relived of the duty after acceptance of the offer of voluntary retirement or resignation jural relationship of the employee and the employer does not come to an end. since the order accepting the voluntary retirement was a conditional the conditions ought to have been complied with. before the conditions could be complied with the appellant withdraw the scheme. consequently the order accepting voluntary retirement did not become effective. thereby no vested right has been created in favour of the respondent. the high court therefore was not right in holding that the respondent has acquired a vested right and therefore the appellant has no right to withdraw the scheme subsequently. this decision is an authority for the proposition that even after acceptance of the offer made by the employee the scheme can be withdrawn and if it is so d the employee does not acquire any vested right. in j.n. srivastava 's case supra it was held:"it is now well settled that even if the voluntary retirement notice is moved by an employee and gets accepted by the authority within the time fixed before the date of retirement is reached the employee has locus poenitiae to withdraw the proposal for voluntary retirement. in wg. cdr t. $$$ 's case the fact of the matter was as . the respondent submitted an application on --praying for premature retirement with effect from --. he also furnished a certificate stating that he was aware that any request made by him for cancellation of his application for premature retirement would not be accepted. on --he moved an amendment to earlier application stating that the actual date of his release could be decided taking into account the pensionary recommendations requirements of the fourth pay commission 's report which was expected to come in november. he subsequently withdraw his offer on --. the respondent received a letter dated 0th february that he would prematurely retire from service with effect from --. on a writ petition moved by the respondent before the karnataka high court it was held that having regard to the offer made on --the subsequent action taken by the department on 0th february had no effect. in this court an argument was advanced that having regard to the policy decision to which the respondent was aware and having given a certificate at the time of submission of application for premature retirement that he was aware of the fact that his request for withdrawal or cancellation subsequently would not be accepted the impugned judgment of the high court was errous but rejecting the same this court held:"we have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel appearing on either side. the reliance placed for the appellants on the decision reported in $$$ is in appropriate to the facts of this case. in that case this court merely emphasized the position that when a public servant has invited by his letter of resignation determination of his employment his service clearly stands terminated from the date on which the letter of resignation is accepted by the appropriate authority and in the absence of any law or rule governing the condition of the service to the contrary it will not be open to the public servant to withdraw his resignation after it is accepted by the appropriate authority and that till the resignation is accepted by the appropriate authority in consonance with the rules governing the acceptance the public servant concerned had locus poenitiae but not thereafter.in shambhu murari sinha 's case it was held:"coming to the case in hand the letter of acceptance was a conditional inasmuch as though option of the appellant for the voluntary retirement under the $$$ was accepted but it was stated that the release memo along with detailed particulars would follows. before the appellant was actually released from the service he withdraw his option for voluntary retirement by sending letters dated --and --but there was no response from the respondent. by office memorandum dated --the appellant was released from the service and that too from $$$$. it is not disputed that the appellant was paid his salaries etc. till his date of actual release i. --and therefore the jural relationship of employee and employer between the appellant and the respondents did not come to an end on the date of acceptance of the voluntary retirement and the said relationship continued till --. the appellant admittedly sent letters withdrawing his voluntary retirement before his actual date of release from service. therefore in view of the settled position of the law and the terms of the letter of acceptance the appellant had locus poenitiae to withdraw his proposal for voluntary retirement before the relationship of employer and employee came to an end. it may be that there did not exist a clause to the effect that once an option to voluntary retirement is accepted the employee can not withdraw the same but the law laid down therein would apply herein also. the submission of learned attorney general that as soon as an offer is made by an employee the same would amount to resignation in praesenti can not be accepted. the scheme was in force for a fixed period. a decision by the authority was required to be taken and till a decision was taken the jural relationship of employer and employee continued and the concerned employees would have been entitled to payment of all salaries and allowances etc. thus it can not be said to be a case where the offer was given in praesenti but the same would be prospective in nature keeping in view of the fact that it was come into force at a later date and that too subject to acceptance thereof by the employer. we therefore are of the opinion that the decisions of this court as referred to herein before shall apply to the facts of the present case also. however it is accepted that a group of employees accepted the gratia payment. those who accepted the gratia payment or any other benefit under the scheme in our considered opinion could not have resiled therefrom. the scheme is contractual in nature. the contractual right derived by the concerned employees therefore could be waived. the employees concerned having accepted a part of the benefit could not be permitted to approbate and reprobate nor can they be permitted to resile from their earlier stand. in lachoo mal 's case supra the law is stated in following terms:"the general principle is that every has a right to waive and to agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity which may be dispensed with without infringing any public right or public policy. thus the maxim which sanctions the non -observance of the statutory provision is cuilibet licet renuntiare juri pro se introducto. see maxwell on interpretation of statutes eleventh edition pages and. if there is any express prohibition against contracting out of a statute in it then no question can arise of any entering into a contract which is so prohibited but where there is no such prohibition it will have to be seen whether an act is inded to have a more exsive operation as a matter of public policy. in halsbury 's laws of england volume third edition it is stated in paragraph at page a general rule any person can enter into a binding contract to waive the benefits conferred upon him by an act of parliament or as it is said can contract himself out of the act unless it can be shown that such an agreement is in the circumstances of the particular case contrary to public policy. statutory conditions may however be imposed in such terms that they can not be waived by agreement and in certain circumstances the legislature has expressly provided that any such agreement shall be void. in brijendra nath bhargava 's case supra the law is stated in following terms:"it clearly goes to show that if a party gives up the advantage he could take of a position of law it is not open to him to change and say that he can avail of that ground. in dawsons bank ltd. case their lordships were considering the question of waiver as a little different from estoppel and they observed as under on the other hand waiver is contractual and may constitute a cause of action it is an agreement to release or not to assert a right. if an agent with authority to make such an agreement on behalf of his principal agrees to waive his principal 's rights then subject to any other question such as consideration the principal will be bound but he will be bound by contract...but in the context of the conclusion that we have reached on the basis of circumstances indicated above that it could not be held that the ant had constructed his dichotic or balcony a wooden piece without the consent express or implied of the landlord in our opinion it is not necessary for us to dilate on the question of waiver any further and in this view of the matter we are not referring to the other decisions on the question of waiver. in halsbury 's laws of england edition vol.reissue para at page it is $$$ the principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate a special species of estoppel has arisen. the principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate express proposition:(1 that the person in question having a choice between courses of conduct is to be treated as having made an election from which he can not resile.that he will be regarded in general at any rate as having so elected unless he has taken a benefit under or arising out of the course of conduct which he has perused and with which his subsequent conduct is inconsist. in american jurisprudence $$$$ edition. volume page -it is stated:"$$$ by the acceptance of benefits $$$ is frequently based upon the acceptance and retion by having knowledge or notice of the facts of benefits from a transaction contract instrument regulation which he might have rejected or contested. this doctrine is obviously a branch of the rule against assuming inconsist positions.as a general principle one who knowingly accepts the benefits of a contract or conveyance is estopped to deny the validity or binding effect on him of such contract or conveyance.this rule has to be applied to do equity and must nor be applied in such a manner as to violate the principles of right and good conscience. we also accept the contion raised by the learned counsel for the respondents that the concerned appellants could not have accepted the offer of voluntary retirement after expiry of the scheme. all actions by the $$$ were required to be taken strictly in terms of the said scheme. we are furthermore not in a position to accept the arguments of mr. mukul rohtagi to the effect that writ petitions were not maintainable as thereby the writ petitioners inded to enforce a contract. the writ petitioners filed the writ petitions inter alia questioning the validity of the scheme. in any event validity of clause.of the said scheme was in question. the appellants herein are state within the meaning of article of the constitution of india. the questions raised by the writ petitioners thus could be raised in a proceeding under article of the constitution of india. furthermore in the event it be held that the action of the appellants was arbitrary and unreasonable the same would attract the wrath of article of the constitution of india. furthermore the right of the employee to continue in employment which is a fundamental right under article of the constitution of india could not have been taken away except in accordance with law. the decision of this court in $$$ and ors. v. the dy. excise and $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0321/7$$$ / sc/0321/7 is not apposite. in that case this court was concerned with the question as to whether enforcing the terms and conditions of a contract of supply of liquor which is a privilege would be permissible in a writ proceeding in the aforementioned situation the writ was held to be nor maintainable. such is not the position herein. we may now deal with that part of the order of the punjab & haryana high court whereby it has been held that the entire scheme is ultra vires being violative of $$$ -regulation of regulation of the regulations. we do not agree with the decision of the high court on that count for more than reason. firstly the scheme is not a part of the statutory regulation. it was in the realm of contract. that being so it was not necessary for the central government to place the same before the parliament. secondly even if the same was a regulation the laying down rule is merely a directory one and not mandatory. in jan mohammad 's case supra the law is stated in following terms:"finally the validity of the rules framed under the bombay act of the was canvassed. by section of the bombay act the state government was authorised to make rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act. it was provided by sub -section that the rules made under section shall be laid before each of the house of the provincial legislature at the session thereof next following and shall be liable to be modified or rescinded by a resolution in which both houses concur and such rules shall after notification in the official gazette be deemed to have been modified or rescinded accordingly. it was argued by the petitioner that the rules framed under the bombay act of were not placed before the legislative assembly or the legislative council at the session and therefore they had no legal validity. the rules under act of were framed by the provisional government of bombay in. at that time there was no legislature in session the legislature having been suspended during the emergency arising out of world war ii. the session of the bombay legislative assembly was convened for the time after on may. the session was prorogued on may. the session of the bombay legislative assembly was convened on july and that of the bombay legislative council on september and the rules were placed on the assembly table in the session before the legislative assembly on september and before the legislative council on september. section of bombay act of does not prescribe that the rules acquired validity only from the date on which they were placed before the houses of legislature. the rules are valid from the date on which they are made under section. it is true that the legislature has prescribed that the rules shall be placed before the houses of legislature but failure to place the rules before the houses of legislature does not affect the validity of the rules merely because they have not been placed before the houses of the legislature. granting that the provisions of sub -section of section by reasons of the failure to place the rules before the houses of legislature were violated we are of the view that sub -section of section having regard to the purposes for which it is made and in the context in which it occurs can not be regarded as mandatory. the rules have been in operation since the year and by virtue of section of the gujrat act of they continue to remain in operation. in atlas cycle industries ' case supra the same view has been reiterated. we therefore are of the opinion that the scheme in question can not be said to be bad in law. the punjab and haryana high court in its impugned judgment has refused to grant any relief in writ petitions wherein prayers were made to the effect that the bank should be directed to act in terms of the said scheme. the relief prayed for by the concerned petitioners were denied by the high court on the ground that the same was not enforceable. we have not accepted that part of the judgment of the high court. in that view of the matter the high court must now consider the claim of the said writ petitioners on merits and pass an appropriate order in accordance with law. the said matters are therefore remitted to the high court for consideration thereof afresh. for the reasons aforementioned we direct that:1. the appeals preferred by the nationalised banks arising from the high courts are dismissed except the cases where the concerned employees have accepted a part of the benefit under the scheme however in respect of such of the employees who despite acceptance of a part of the retirement benefit under the scheme had continued under the orders of the high court and has retired on attaining the age of superannuation this order shall not apply;2. the appeals filed by the state bank of india are allowed:3. the appeals arising from the judgments of the uttranchal high court are allowed and the judgments of the said high court are set aside:4. the appeals arising from the judgments of the punjab and haryana high court in relation to writ petitions which were filed by the employees for a direction upon the bank that the benefits under the scheme be paid to them are set aside and the matters are remitted to the high court for consideration thereof afresh on merits and in accordance with law;129. these appeals are disposed of on the above terms. however in the facts and circumstances of the case the parties shall pay and bear their own costs throughout.
