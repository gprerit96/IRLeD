$$$ j. $$$$ granted in s.l.p. civil no. of. having regard to the commonality of controversy in this batch of appeals it was heard together and is disposed of by a singular judgment. for the sake of clarity and convenience i shall adumbrate the facts from civil appeal nos. -of and at the appropriate stage refer to the views expressed in other appeals. the st respondent m.p. $$$ an -serviceman joined as a clerk on.in the appellant -bank which has been constituted under the state bank of india act for brevity the act. the indian $$$ association i.b.a.after obtaining approval from the government of india evolved a $$$ v.r.s.and the appellant -bank adopted the $$$ with certain modifications despite it having its own $$$ in the existing service conditions meant for its employees to seek voluntary retirement / premature retirement / resignation. the $$$ namely s.b.i. $$$ $$$ for short the $$$ was adopted by the state bank of india on.. the $$$ was to remain open during the period.to.with the option either to close it early or extend the period without assigning any reason. after adoption of the $$$ the deputy managing director the competent authority issued a $$$ no. $$$ / $$$ / vrs/ on.clarifying certain aspects of the $$$. another $$$ being no. $$$ / $$$ / vrs/ was issued on.. on.the said $$$ was brought to the notice of all the branches / offices of all the circles including $$$. as per the $$$ the applications for voluntary retirement under the $$$ were to be submitted during the period i..to.. the st respondent submitted his application seeking voluntary retirement and it was accepted on.with effect from.. on.the respondent no. submitted an application to withdraw his request for voluntary retirement. the said application was declined by the bank on.stating that the date for withdrawal of application had already expired on.. it is apt to note that here the respondent wrote a letter on.claiming pension under the pension fund $$$s in terms of state bank of india employees pension $$$s for short the $$$s. the claim of $$$$ respondent for withdrawal of his application for voluntary retirement and grant of pension and leave encashment was refused by the bank on.. being grieved by the aforesaid refusal and declination of the prayer the st respondent preferred writ petition being cwp no. of. the writ court took note of the fact there was acceptance of the voluntary retirement on.with a stipulation that the employee would be relieved from his duties at the close of business hours on.. the division bench referred to the decision in mohinder pal singh v. punjab and sind bank and ors. slr and the decision of this court in bank of india and ors. v. o.p. $$$ etc. $$$ / sc//00$$$ / sc//00 scc and after reproducing the directions of from $$$ 's case came to hold as follows in view of the aforesaid finding the moment a decision is taken by the bank the jural relationship of employer and employee stood terminated. the $$$ has admittedly sought to withdraw his offer to seek voluntary retirement after the acceptance was conveyed to the $$$. mere fact that the date of voluntary retirement was fixed as.is wholly inconsequential as employer and employee relationship has already come to an end with the communication of acceptance. it was only the procedural part under which the $$$ continued to work till..in the ultimate analysis the high court did not find any merit with regard to refusal by the bank in not accepting the application for withdrawal submitted by the employee. determination on the said score is not under assail in any of the appeals before this court. the next question that emerged for consideration before the high court was whether the employee was entitled to pension in terms of the rules including computed value of pension. it was contended by the st respondent in the writ court that the pension rules were amended on.and the said rules were in vogue when the $$$ had submitted his application for voluntary retirement and hence he was entitled to get the pensionary benefits. it was also urged that in terms of the amended $$$ of the pension rules he was entitled to pension. the said submission was resisted by the bank that $$$ did not cover the cases like that of the $$$. in justification of the said submission reliance was placed on the division bench judgment of the high court of delhi in $$$ and ors. v. state bank of india and ors. decided on.in l.p.a. no. of and also on a decision rendered by the high court of $$$ in c.w.p. no. of. the division bench referred to the anatomy of $$$ and after analyzing the scope of the rule distinguished the decision of the high court of delhi as well as that of $$$ and came to hold that it was apparent from the record that the writ $$$ was in service of the bank on.and had completed $$$$ of pensionable service and further had attained $$$$ $$$$. therefore in terms of $$$ of the pension $$$s he was entitled to pension. dealing with the claim for leave encashment which is based upon the circular of the bank dated.it opined that the leave encashment was payable to an employee of the bank who had been discharged if he was eligible for pension and as it had been found that the $$$ was entitled to pension in terms of the pension $$$s he would be entitled to leave encashment as well. in this batch of appeals the question that emanates for consideration whether the respondent -employees are entitled to get pension. there can be no cavil over the fact that their right to seek withdrawal from the scheme of voluntary retirement has been negatived by the impugned judgments passed by various high courts and therefore i am not required to address the said issue. it is essential to advert to the issue whether the employee would be entitled to pension under the corners of the $$$s. $$$ which squarely falls for consideration is as follows:. a member shall be entitled to a pension under these rules on retiring from the bank 's service-(a after having completed $$$$ ' pensionable service provided that he has attained $$$$ $$$$ or if he is in the service of the bank on or after.after having completed $$$$ pensionable service provided that he has attained $$$$ $$$$ or if he is in the service of the bank on or after.after having completed $$$$ pensionable service provided that he has attained $$$$ $$$$;(b after having completed $$$$ ' pensionable service irrespective of the age he shall have attained if he shall satisfy the authority competent to sanction his retirement by approved medical certificate or otherwise that he is incapacitated for further active service;(c after having completed $$$$ pensionable service irrespective of the age he shall have attained at his request in writing.after $$$$ ' pensionable service.a member who has attained the age of -$$$$ or who shall be proved to the satisfaction of the authority empowered to sanction his retirement to be permanently incapacitated by bodily or mental infirmity from further active service such infirmity not being the result of irregular or intemperate habits may at the discretion of the trustees be granted a proportionate pension.a member who has been permitted to retire under clause above shall be entitled to proportionate pension. $$$ the aforesaid $$$ in view it is obligatory to scrutinize the analysis made by the high court in the backdrop of the facts. the high court has taken note of the fact that $$$$ had completed more than $$$$ and $$$$s of service as on.and therefore the part of clause a is not applicable to him. the high court has also opined that the part of clause a is not applicable to him as he had completed more than $$$$ of service but not attained the age of $$$$. the case of $$$$ was that his case was covered under part of clause a which enables an employee to get pension if he was in service of the bank as on.and had completed $$$$ ' of service and attained the age of $$$$. the high court took note of the fact that the counter -affidavit was silent regarding the claim of $$$$ under part of clause a. analysing further in this regard the high court opined as follows the $$$ has submitted his offer for voluntary retirement in terms of the pension $$$s existing in $$$$ of january. on the said date a member of the pension funds was entitled to pension on completion of $$$$ of pensionable service provided he has attained the age of $$$$. alternatively if a member is in service of the bank on or after.and has completed $$$$ of pensionable service and has attained the age of $$$$ he shall be entitled to the pension. the $$$ fulfils the part of clause a of $$$ which was in existence on $$$$ when the $$$ submitted his request for voluntary retirement. even after the amendment on.another clause has been added i.  part of clause a as mentid above which does not affect the claim of the $$$ for pension as he is entitled to pension in the part of $$$. the high court referred to the voluntary retirement $$$ floated on.and reproduced the relevant part of the said $$$ which is as follows:. amount of ex -gratia the staff member whose request for retirement under sbivrs has been accepted by competent authority will be paid an amount of -gratia of days ' salary pay plus stagnation increments plus special pay plus dearness allowance for $$$$ of service for this purpose fraction of service of $$$$s and above will be taken as year and accordingly service of less than $$$$s will be counted or salary for $$$$ service is left whichever is less fraction of $$$$ if any will be ignored. ' relevant date means the date on which the employee ceases to be in service of the bank as a consequence of the acceptance of the request for voluntary retirement under the scheme.for the purpose of calculation of -gratia days salary mentid in the $$$ is to be taken as equivalent to $$$$s salary with reference to salary for $$$$ in which employee is relieved from service on $$$.income tax shall be deducted at source in respect of -gratia exceeding rs.lakhs or such other ceiling as may be prescribed under the income tax act as on the relevant date. other benefits: gratuity as payable under the extent instructions on the relevant date. provident fund contribution as per state bank of india employees provident fund $$$s as on relevant date. pension in terms of state bank of india employees ' pension fund $$$s on the relevant date including commuted value of pension. encashment of balance of privilege $$$$ as applicable on the relevant date. respective facilities extended to officers / others such as retention of accommodation teleph car continuation of housing loan etc.will be extended to officers / others retiring under sbivrs as per present dispensations at the discretion of competent authority. however in such cases of retention of physical facilities % of the amount of -gratia payable will be released only after the employee surrenders the facilities. no interest however will be paid for the amount so withheld. all other outstanding loans / advances will have to be repaid before date of retirement under sbivrs failing which the amount of -gratia and other terminal benefits payable to the employee will be appropriate towards the outstanding loans / advances and the balance amount only will be payable to the employee. the high court opined that the said paragraphs when properly appreciated convey that the amount of -gratia is to be paid and what are the other benefits to be paid have also been enumerated. referring to clause it ruled that it deals with gratuity provident fund contribution pension in terms of the $$$s on the relevant date including commuted value of pension encashment of balance of privilege leave and certain other benefits. the court also took note of the clarificatory circular issued by the bank on.. while answering the question whether or not the employee completing $$$$ of pensionable service as on relevant date the court held he would be entitled for pension benefit. presently i shall refer to the relevant part of clarificatory circular in this connection we invite a reference to para of the $$$ forwarded under the cover of $$$ no. cir.do / per & hrd/ dated.. the payment of pension to the employee retiring under sbivrs would be governed by state bank of india employees pension fund $$$s on the relevant date including commuted value of pension. however as per existing rules employees who have not completed $$$$ of pensionable service are not eligible for pension. having noted the rule relating to pension on which the case is founded and the scheme on which reliance has been placed by the high court it is necessary to notice how various high courts have approached this problem. i have already stated that the high court of punjab and $$$ has opined that the employee who had opted for voluntary retirement is entitled to pension in the part of $$$. now i shall advert to the analysis made by the high court of calcutta which is the subject matter of c.a. no. -of. the learned single judge of the high court of calcutta took note of the contention that when an offer of acceptance had become a concluded contract any subsequent change of the pension fund rules could not have adversely affected his rights for the explanatory memorandum issued by the bank on th march stipulated to the effect that no employee / pensir of the state bank of india is likely to be effected adversely by the notification being given retrospective effect. he repelled the contention of the bank that the voluntary retirement scheme itself provided that payment of pension was dependent upon the rules prevalent on the date on which the employee would cease to be in service of the bank and admittedly the writ $$$ therein had ceased to be an employee on st march and thereafter the amendment of the pension rules effecting from $$$$ was binding upon him and as such he was not liable to get any pension. the learned single judge formulated issues namely whether the right of the $$$ to receive pension as per the existing rules could have been taken away by the amended rules which became effective on st march and was the writ $$$ estopped from espousing his cause of action due to delay laches and acquiescence and answered both the issues in the negative against the bank and in favour of the writ $$$. on an appeal being preferred the division bench referred to section and of the contract act and came to hold as follows in the case before us on the date of acceptance of the contract it was known to the bank that it had already decided to amend its pension rules by which the appellant would be deprived of his right to get pension although on the date of acceptance if he retired he would be entitled to get pension. the employee had no means of knowledge of such change of pension rules at the time of agreement. in such a situation the relation between the parties being that of employer and employee it was the duty of the employer to inform the employee about the future amendment of the pension rules which would deprive the employee of his right to get pension by entering into the voluntary retirement scheme. if he had known this fact he would not definitely enter into the scheme because if he had retired in due course without opting for voluntary retirement he would be entitled to get pension even under the amended rules. therefore the silence maintained by the employer in such a situation amounted to fraud on its part. as pointed out in illustration b to section of the contract act if it becomes a duty of a father to disclose the defect of the horse proposed to be sold to his just grown up daughter in the same manner it is also the duty of the employer to inform his employee about the future amendment of the pension rules causing prejudice to his employee at the last stage of his service life before accepting the terms of the voluntary retirement scheme declared by it when such source of prejudice is know to the employer and the employee had no manner of knowledge of such perilous condition.$$$ the bench referred to food corporation of india v. kamdhenu cattle feed industries $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ air sc and opined thus therefore on that ground also the writ $$$ is entitled to get the pensionary benefit which was available to him on the date of declaration of the scheme and also on the date of acceptance of the offer of the employee under voluntary retirement scheme. if the proposed amendment was disclosed to the writ $$$ in advance he would not have accepted such prejudicial terms of voluntary retirement scheme and offered for the scheme. we do no for a moment dispute the submission of mr. $$$ the $$$. sr. advocated appearing on behalf of the appellant that the contract was competed by acceptance of the offer of the employee under the scheme as laid down in the case of bank of india v. o.p. $$$ but the appellant having committed fraud upon the writ $$$ by adopting silence in the matter of proposed amendment of the pension rules on $$$$ of the service of the employee the writ $$$ is entitled to the relief claimed by taking aid of article of the constitution of india. be it stated as the single judge had not granted interest the division bench thought it appropriate to grant interest at the rate % per annum on arrears amount of pension. as far as the high court of allahabad is concerned the learned single judge had remitted the matter to the bank to consider the case of the writ $$$ for his entitlement for grant of pension. in the intra -court appeal the division bench addressed to the lis on merits referred to clause c of the scheme which provides that pension shall be granted in terms of state bank of india employees ' pension fund $$$s on the relevant date including commuted value pension and opined that the said clause was a binding contract between the writ $$$ and on.the bank accepted the offer of retirement made by the writ $$$ though the employee did in fact retire on.. the high court took note of the fact although the amendments were sufficiently formulated before.yet the trustees of the pension fund accepted the amended rules only on the.. the high court referred to the existing rules and the amended rules which i shall refer to at a later stage. it was contended by the writ $$$ before the division bench that he was covered under part of the $$$ i a inasmuch as he was in the service of the bank on and after.and he had completed $$$$ of pensionable service and attained the age of $$$$ before the date he retired. the bank resisting the said stand contended that the clarificatory circular issued by the bank and contended that the employee was not entitled to get pensionary benefits. the high court observed that the clarification had no greater status in law than the reading and understanding the terms of the contract according to party. it opined that the pension rules should apply to the writ $$$ not by any force of special statutory law but only by force of agreement. eventually the court ruled thus the important point raised by the bank was that under of the pension fund $$$s when an employee retires upon a request in writing being made by him he has to complete $$$$ of service. thus the voluntary retirement being a retirement pursuant to the employees ' request it is this clause which will be applicable to him and it will not be proper to give him pension because he comes under another clause i. clause a which was merely introduced to accommodate late entrants into service when the retirement age was raise to on.and then to on.. clause a was inserted so as to give employees benefit of pension after $$$$ of pensionable service even if they had joined late. according to the bank the writ $$$ is seeking to take advantage of this clause although this clause was never intended to cover it.it is also said that if in cases of retirement on request in writing clause a is made applicable then clause c will have no field of operation at all. everybody will be entitled to pension after $$$$ and therefore the $$$$ ' requirement of clause c will lose all meaning. $$$ the division bench referred to clause of the bank fund $$$s which permits retirement on request by the bank employee provided a sanction is made by the competent authority. after referring to the said clause the court held thus in our opinion the voluntary retirement under the scheme should not be equated to a retirement to clause of the pension fund $$$s. it might be that clause made to cover pension aspects for clause retirements and clause was made to cover normal superannuation retirements but voluntary retirement was a special contract made available for special purpose and that too for a very small period of time which was practically moment or just short fleeting period during an employee 's service career. for this scheme and this contract the pension rules did not apply as rules. the rules apply only as words in the contract. therefore if a contracting party is entitled to take benefit of a permissive clause then that can not be denied to him on the basis of purpose if construction of a statutory rule. this type of purposive construction is far less if at all applied to contracts. contacts are generally speaking strictly interpreted on the basis of the language agreed upon by the parties. the court does not make out the parties ' contract they make their own contact.on this basis of strict interpretation the writ $$$ clearly comes within $$$ although this is better put as clause of the pension fund $$$s in reference to the contract.regarding the other aspect of clause having no field of operation at all bare look will show that the said clause will operate in all cases where the retiring employee has not even attained the age of $$$$. if the pensionable period of $$$$ has been completed before that and the competent authority grants sanction to retire under $$$ then and in that event would get pension although would not under the or parts of clause. thus each part of the contractual document is left with a meaning even if the interpretation in favour of the writ $$$ is wholly accepted. at this juncture it is apt to appreciate the decision rendered in case of $$$ supra by the division bench of delhi high court. in the said case the division bench dealing with the state bank of india $$$ whereunder the option exercised by the employees was accepted by the respondent bank on.. all the appellants therein had either completed $$$$ of service or were of $$$$ of age as on.and accordingly as per the provision of the state bank of india employees pension and provident fund $$$s they had claimed pension as per the rules. the court referred to indian bank 's association letter dated.which was the fulcrum of the scheme to get the pension. the division bench reproduced the said letter which i think it appropriate to reproduce.indian bank 's association stadium house floor block veer nariman road mumbai-000pd / cir/7/g/g/december $$$$designated officers of all public sector $$$.dear sirs $$$ in public sector $$$ -amendments to bank employees ' pension regulations.please refer to our circular letter no. pd / cir/7/g/$$$$ dated st august convening the no objection of the government in banks adopting and implementing a voluntary retirement scheme for employees on the lines of what was contained in the annexure to the circular.as per the scheme an employee who is eligible and applies for voluntary retirement is entitled for the benefit of cpf pension gratuity and encashment of accumulated privilege leave as per rules.bank employees ' pension regulations do not have provisions enabling payment of pension to an employee who retires before attaining the age of superannuation except under circumstances as in regulations and. we had therefore taken up with the government the need to incorporate necessary provisions in the pension regulations by way of amendments to regulation so that employees who retire as above under special / ad hoc schemes formulated by the banks after serving for a prescribed minimum period would be eligible for pro rata pension.government of india has after examining the proposal conveyed its approval and desired that iba advise banks to make necessary amendments to their pension regulations as in the annexure. we request banks to take note accordingly.please note that with the above amendments employees who apply for voluntary retirement after having rendered $$$$ $$$$ of service under a special / ad hoc scheme formulated with the specific approval of the government and the board of directors will be eligible for pro rata pension for the period of service rendered as they are to retire on attaining the age of superannuation on that date.yours faithfully sd/-(allen c a pereira)personnel adviser. it was contended before the high court that under the said recommendation the bank was obliged to pay pension to them but the said contention was not accepted by the single judge on the ground the said letter is not a binding circular under section of the state bank of india act. the learned single judge had also opined that voluntary retirement scheme was a package by itself and it was not open to the employees to ask for modification of the scheme and if the employees wanted to avail of the benefit of pension they should not have opted under the scheme and after completing requisite $$$$ of service would have been entitled to pension. the court examined the sbivrs dated.and opined that it was an invitation to the employees to make an offer and opt for voluntary retirement. the scheme as analysed by the division bench specifically stipulated that the employees who were eligible and the period during which an offer for voluntary retirement could be made. reference was made to clause and of the scheme that provides for -gratia payment to the officers who had opted for voluntary retirement. the court referring to the letter dated.opined that the payment of pension to an employee retiring under the voluntary retirement scheme are to be governed by the relevant pension rules and as per the existing rules an employee who had not completed $$$$ of pensionable service would not be eligible for pension. $$$ the division bench observed that the employee who has opted under voluntary retirement scheme was fully conscious and aware of the fact that he would not be entitled to pension under the scheme as he had not completed $$$$ of pensionable service and pension was payable only to those employees who were eligible for pension under the rules as applicable of the relevant date. reference was made to bank of india o.p. $$$ supra and accordingly it was held as follows the appellants therefore can not be allowed to wriggle out of the terms and conditions accepted and agreed upon by the parties viz. the appellants and the respondent -bank. the appellants had entered into the said contract with open eyes and fully conscious and aware of what benefits they would be entitled to by opting under the $$$ retirement $$$. they were conscious and aware and in fact specifically informed by way of clarification by the respondent that the employees who had not completed $$$$ of service would not be eligible for pension under the relevant rules. the appellants by way of appeal are seeking modification of the terms of the concluded contract which in equity is not just and fair.eventually concurring with the single judge the division bench ruled:. the state bank of india as already stated has its own pension regulations. the employees of the state bank of india are bound by the same. letter / circular dated th december refers to amendment to bank employees ' pension regulations. the said regulations are not applicable to the employees of state bank of india. the pension regulations applicable to the state bank of india employees are different. as far as employees of state bank of india are concerned the bank employees ' pension regulations are not applicable. the amendment suggested by letter / circular dated th december by indian bank 's association was not applicable to the appellants and the employees of the state bank of india. we may also point out here that state bank of india in the counter affidavit has explained that its $$$ retirement $$$ was a special and a distinct scheme offering a handsome package for the employees who were ready and willing to opt for retirement. it is also pointed out that the state bank of india 's employees unlike employees belonging to other public sector banks were entitled to both contributory provident fund and membership of a pension fund. it is stated that employees of other public sector bank are eligible either for contributory provident fund or membership of pension fund. $$$ for the appellants however also relied on the judgment of a single judge of this court in the case of punjab and sind bank officers association and ors. v. union of india and anr. on th may. in the said case learned single judge was examining regulations and of the bank employees ' pension regulations. the issue was which of the regulations would apply. it was held that regulation would apply to employees who had taken voluntary retirement whether under normal circumstances or under a special scheme. it was further held that the scheme or package can not be altered unilaterally. the said decision does not support the contention of the appellants. the terms and conditions of the $$$ retirement $$$ were clear and specific. the terms were not ambiguous. the employees including the appellants were fully conscious of the decision taken by them and the benefits they would be entitled to. the appellants voluntarily with open eyes entered into an agreement and after having retired and enjoyed the benefits they can not go behind the concluded contract and claim further benefits. it must be remembered that a $$$ retirement $$$ is formulated and conceived in public interest. interest of the respondent bank is also to be taken into consideration. having stated the various views taken by the high courts i may now refer to certain authorities dealing with these kind of schemes. in arikaravula sanyasi raju v. branch manager state bank of india visakhapatnam a.p.and ors. $$$ / sc/7/$$$$$$$ / sc/7/$$$$ scc the question arose whether an officer who is removed from service on finding of misconduct would be entitled to get the relief of pension under $$$ of the state bank of india service $$$s. in the said case the high court had directed the payment of provident fund in terms of rules but denied the relief of pension. the court referred to $$$ of the rules and opined had the officer sought retirement on that basis and allowed the retirement from service he would have been entitled to pension on completion of $$$$ of pensionable service but removal would not entitle him to get pension. interpreting clause the -judge observed thus clause envisage only that after completing $$$$ of pensionable service if an incumbent retired at his request in writing and was permitted to retire he would be entitled to pension. in other words for voluntary retirement on completion of $$$$ of pensionable service clause c of $$$ gets attracted. in v. $$$ v. managing director state bank of india bombay and anr. $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ scc though the court was dealing with eligibility to be entitled for pension under $$$ (i)(c yet it reproduced the rule referred to the contentions and came to hold as follows:. on a close look at the relevant provisions of the $$$s it is not possible to agree with this contention. the appellant in order to earn pension under $$$ clause c as amended in has to satisfy the following twin $$$ at the time when the amended clause c applied i.from --he should be a member of the pension fund;(ii he should have by then completed $$$$ of pensionable service and should have put forward his requisition in writing for availing the benefit of the said provision.unless both these conditions are satisfied the amended clause c of $$$ can not apply in his case. the afore -referred decisions show how the court had perceived the rule position. in vice -chairman and managing director a.p. sidc ltd. and anr. v. r. varaprasad and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc while dealing with the concept of voluntary retirement schemes the court has ruled that all employees who accepted vrs could be relieved at a time or batch by batch depending on availability of funds. further funds may be made available early or late. if the argument of the respondents that relieving date should be taken as effective date for calculating terminal benefits and financial package under vrs the dates may be fluctuating depending on availability of funds. hence it is not possible to accept this argument. when the employees have opted for vrs on their own without any compulsion knowing fully well about the $$$ guidelines and circulars governing the same it is not open to them to make any claim contrary to the terms accepted. it is a matter of contract between the corporation and the employees. it is not for the courts to rewrite the terms of the contract which were clear to the contracting parties as indicated in the guidelines and circulars governing them under which $$$ retirement $$$s floated. in o.p. $$$ supra the question arose whether an employee who opts for voluntary retirement pursuant or in furtherance of scheme floated by the nationalised $$$ and the state bank of india would be precluded from withdrawing the said offer. the court dealing with the concept of voluntary retirement held as follows:. the request of employees seeking voluntary retirement was not to take effect until and unless it was accepted in writing by the competent authority. the competent authority had the absolute discretion whether to accept or reject the request of the employee seeking voluntary retirement under the $$$. a procedure has been laid down for considering the provisions of the said $$$ to the effect that an employee who intends to seek voluntary retirement would submit duly completed application in duplicate in the prescribed form marked offer to seek voluntary retirement and the application so received would be considered by the competent authority on -come - -serve basis. the procedure laid down therefor suggests that the applications of the employee would be an offer which could be considered by the bank in terms of the procedure laid down therefor. there is no assurance that such an application would be accepted without any consideration. acceptance or otherwise of the request of an employee seeking voluntary retirement is required to be communicated to him in writing. this clause is crucial in view of the fact that therein the acceptance or rejection of such request has been provided. the decision of the authority rejecting the request is appealable to the appellate authority. the application made by an employee as an offer as well as the decision of the bank thereupon would be communicated to the respective general managers. the decision -making process shall take place at various levels of the banks.eventually analyzing the stand of various banks the court expressed thus:0. the basic concept of the $$$ therefore underwent a change which also goes to show that the banks had sought to invoke their power of amending the $$$. once the $$$ is amended and/or an apprehension is created in the mind of the employees that they would not even receive the entire benefits as envisaged under the $$$ they were entitled to revoke their offers. their action in our considered opinion is reasonable. it may be that some of the employees only opted for the provident fund benefit which did not undergo any amendment but the same would not change the attitude on the part of the banks. in hec $$$. employees welfare society and anr. v. heavy engineering corporation ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ scc the court referring to concept of voluntary retirement opined that an offer for voluntary retirement in terms of a scheme when accepted leads to a concluded contract between the employer and the employee. in terms of such a scheme an employee has an option either to accept or not to opt therefor. the scheme is purely voluntary in terms whereof the tenure of service is curtailed which is permissible in law. such a scheme is ordinarily floated with a purpose of downsizing the employees. it is beneficial both to the employees as well as to the employer. such a scheme is issued for effective functioning of the industrial undertakings. the court further observed that although the company is a state within the meaning of article of the constitution the terms and conditions of service would be governed by the contract of employment. thus unless the terms and conditions of such a contract are governed by a statute or statutory rules the provisions of the contract act would be applicable both at the formulation of the contract as also the determination thereof. by reason of such a scheme it only is an invitation of offer floated. when pursuant to or in furtherance of such a $$$ retirement $$$ an employee opts therefor he makes an offer which upon acceptance by the employer gives rise to a contract. thus as the matter relating to voluntary retirement is not governed by any statute the provisions of the contract act therefore would be applicable too. in this context reliance was placed on o.p. $$$ 's case supra. after so stating the court ruled we have noticed that admittedly of employees had opted for voluntary retirement during the period in question. they indisputably form a distinct and different class. having given our anxious consideration thereto we are of the opinion that neither are they discharged employees nor are they superannuated employees. the expression superannuation connotes a distinct meaning. it ordinarily means unless otherwise provided for in the statute that not only he reaches the age of superannuation prescribed therefor but also becomes entitled to the retiral benefits thereof including pension. $$$ retirement could have fallen within the aforementid expression provided it was so stated expressly in the $$$.financial considerations are thus a relevant factor both for floating a scheme of voluntary retirement as well as for revision of pay. those employees who opted for voluntary retirement make a planning for the future. at the time of giving option they know where they stand. at that point of time they did not anticipate that they would get the benefit of revision in the scales of pay. they prepared themselves to contract out of the jural relationship by resorting to golden handshake. they are bound by their own act. the parties are bound by the terms of contract of voluntary retirement. we have noticed hereinbefore that unless a statute or statutory provision interdicts the relationship between the parties to act pursuant to or in furtherance of the voluntary retirement $$$ is governed by contract. by such contract they can opt out of such other terms and conditions as may be agreed upon. in this case the terms and conditions of the contract are not governed by a statute or statutory rules.in the said case the court referred to v. $$$ case supra and understood it in the following manner it has not been suggested that voluntary retirement in the absence of any express statutory rule governing the field would bring about a case of superannuation. in v. $$$ a new rule was introduced providing for pension of an employee after retirement on completion of $$$$ of service provided he requested in writing therefor. the questions which fell for consideration therein were that if a person was eligible for pension at the time of his retirement and if he survives till the time of subsequent amendment of the relevant pension $$$ whether he would become entitled to enhanced pension or would become entitled to get more pension. in the fact new formula of computation of pension. in per the situation obtaining therein it was held that employees could be divided in categories i. those who were eligible for pension at the time of their retirement and those who were not. whereas in the case of category the benefit of the amended provisions would be applicable but in the it would not. v. $$$ also thus in our opinion is not applicable to the fact of the present case. in this backdrop i am required to scan the anatomy of $$$ and the appropriate interpretation is required to be placed on the same. $$$ (i a postulates that members shall be entitled to pension under the said rule on retiring from the bank 's service. thus the key word is retiring from bank 's service. the said rule when understood in proper perspective covers cases of normal retirement / superannuation. there are various compartments and each compartment has different criterion. an employee who has completed $$$$ of pensionable service and has attained the age of $$$$ would be entitled to get the pension under the rules. this is compartment.  as is envisaged carves out an exception to the part which stipulates that when an employee who is working in the bank on or after.and has completed $$$$ of pensionable service shall be entitled for pension provided he has attained the age of $$$$. the part of the rule stipulates that all employees who are in service of the bank or after.and have put in $$$$ of pensionable service to be eligible for pension provided they have attained the age of $$$$ i. age of superannuation. as the facts would demonstrate in the instant case the employees / respondents before attaining the age of superannuation sought voluntary retirement under the $$$. at this juncture it is relevant to state $$$ which provides that an employee who has completed $$$$ of pensionable service irrespective of age if he satisfies the authority competent to sanction retirement by appropriate medical certificate or otherwise that he is incapacitated for further active service he would be entitled to pension. this clause does not cover the present respondents. clause deals with entitlement of pension by an employee if he has completed $$$$ of pensionable service irrespective of age if he seeks retirement at his own request in writing. it is the stand of the bank that $$$ (i)(c was added on.for the specific purpose of granting pension to those who have voluntary retired. as is evident from the factual score under the sbi vrs the employees were required to submit written applications seeking voluntary retirement under the $$$. when the scheme was in operation the competent authority i. deputy managing director had issued a circular dated.clarifying the position that the employees could withdraw their applications made under sbi vrs by.and those employees who have not completed $$$$ of pensionable service are not eligible for pension. there can be no doubt by abundant caution the bank issued a clarificatory circular. the said circular can not be given any type of nomenclature other than a clarificatory circular despite treated as such. it is graphically clear from the same that an employee who has completed $$$$ of pensionable service would be entitled to pension even if they seek voluntary retirement under sbi vrs. it was open to the employees to withdraw their applications under sbi vrs by.. the respondent -employees as is manifest chose not to withdraw. in these circumstances the question arises whether any part of $$$ would apply to the respondent for extension of benefit of pension. as has been elaborated earlier clause and are not applicable to them. mr. rohtagi learned attorney general has submitted that on.the sbi employees pension fund $$$s was amended by the central board of sbi. the sbi vrs was in operation from.to.. the employees were at liberty as has been stated earlier to withdraw by.. admittedly the $$$ was in force on.. the employees were very well aware about the amended $$$. there can be no scintilla of doubt that the $$$ existed as on.. if an employee wanted to withdraw he could have withdrawn prior to.but as is the admitted position n of the employees withdrew. there is no cavil over the fact that the employees had accepted all the benefits of the vrs. the crux of the matter is whether the respondents can get the benefit despite the amendment brought to the $$$s. in $$$ supra it has been clearly held for voluntary retirement on completion of $$$$ of pensionable service clause c of $$$ (i gets attracted. another aspect needs to be noted. the sbi pension $$$s have been framed under section of the sbi act. the $$$s have statutory force. the concept of any kind of promissory estoppel if any could not be applicable to promote or cond the breach of law. in bangalore development authority and ors. v. r. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/88/$$$$$$$ / sc/88/$$$$ scc it has been held that rule of promissory estoppel can not be availed to permit or cond a breach of law. it can not be invoked to compel the government to do an act prohibited by law for such a direction would be against the statute. to arrive at the said conclusion the -judge bench placed reliance on tisco ltd. v. state of jharkhand $$$ / sc/7/$$$$$$$ / sc/7/$$$$ scc hira tikkoo v. union territory chandigarh $$$ / sc/07/$$$$$$$ / sc/07/$$$$ scc and savitaben $$$ v. state of gujarat $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc. the high court to sustain its conclusion has referred to clause of the $$$ which postulates that the benefits shall be granted to the employee which include the pension and the said pension shall be granted in terms of the state bank of india employees pension fund $$$s on the relevant date. the high court referred to $$$ (i prior to the amendment i... the unamended portion of the $$$ reads as follows after having completed $$$$ ' pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$ or if he is in service of the bank on or after.after having completed $$$$ pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$.after the amendment that was incorporated on.the $$$ reads as under after having completed $$$$ ' pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$ or if he is in service of the bank on or after.after having completed $$$$ pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$ or if he is in the service of the bank on or after.after having completed $$$$ pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$. analysing the said $$$ the high court opined that the employees would be covered under part of clause a of $$$ (i which was in existence on the date when the $$$ submitted his request for voluntary retirement. that apart the high court has also held even after amendment on.by which another clause has been added that is part of clause a would not affect the claim of the employees for pension as he is entitled to pension in the part of $$$ (i. here as i find the high court has opined as the respondent was in service of bank on.and had completed $$$$ of pensionable service and attained the age of $$$$ he would be entitled to pension. there is no doubt that the government of india on.advised all the banks that the age of retirement would be $$$$. accordingly the board of sbi on.itself passed a resolution whereby it fixed the age of retirement $$$$ w.f. that date. as a consequence of re -fixation of age of retirement the rules were amended and part of $$$ was added for all employees who were in service of the bank on or before.and had put in $$$$ of pensionable service to be eligible for pension benefit provided that they have attained the age of $$$$. as has been stated earlier the respondents had not retired on attaining the age of superannuation but sought voluntary retirement under the sbi vrs. the bank has placed reliance on the clarificatory circular issued by the deputy managing director on.which lays a postulate that employees who have not completed $$$$ of pensionable service are not eligible for pension. in this context reference may be made to a decision in bank of baroda and ors. v. $$$ $$$ / sc/8/08$$$ / sc/8/08 scc wherein the court was interpreting bank of baroda employees pension regulations. in the said case the bank of baroda had introduced bank of baroda employees voluntary retirement $$$ and under the $$$ along with terminal benefits pension in terms of regulations was to be provided to the employees who opted for the vrs $$$. the respondent -employee therein after accepting voluntary retirement filed an application for claiming pension which was opposed by the bank in terms of regulations and of the pension regulations. eventually the matter travelled to the tribunal who by its award allowed the respondent 's claim and directed the bank to pay to the respondent pension according to the pension regulations. against the award passed by the industrial disputes tribunal the bank preferred a writ petition before the high court but the said challenge did not meet with any success. this court referred to the language of the $$$ and opined as follows:7. the conditions relating to completing $$$$ of service for being eligible to apply for bobevrs are special to the $$$ as also to the case of those employees who wished to apply for voluntary retirement under the aforesaid $$$ if they had completed or would be completing $$$$ of age. the latter condition appears to have been incorporated in view of the provisions of regulations and of the pension regulations to enable employees who had completed $$$$ of service to also become eligible to apply for premature retirement under the pension regulations. however we are inclined to agree with ms. bhati that regulation does not contemplate voluntary retirement under the voluntary retirement $$$ and applies only to such employees who themselves wish to retire dehors any scheme of voluntary retirement after having completed $$$$ of qualifying service for the said purpose. there is a distinct difference between the situations and regulation would not cover the case of an employee opting to retire on the basis of a voluntary retirement scheme. furthermore regulation of the voluntary retirement $$$ of the appellant bank merely prescribes a period of qualifying service for an employee to be eligible to apply for voluntary retirement. on the other hand regulations and of the pension regulations relate to the period of qualifying service for pension under the said regulations in different situations. while regulation provides that in order to be eligible for pension an employee would have to render a minimum of $$$$ ' service regulation is applicable to the employees choosing to retire from service prematurely and in their case the period of qualifying service would be $$$$.after so stating the court further opined . the facts of the present case however do not attract the provisions of regulation since the respondent accepted the offer of voluntary retirement under the $$$ framed by the bank and not on his own volition dehors any scheme of voluntary retirement. in such a case regulation read with regulation providing for premature retirement would not also apply to the case of the respondent. while regulation of the bobevrs speaks of eligibility for applying under the $$$ regulation of the pension regulations contemplates a situation whereunder an employee would be eligible for premature pension. the provisions are for different purposes and for different situations. however regulation of the pension regulations after amendment made provision for situations similar to the in the instant case. in the absence of any particular provision for payment of pension to those who opted for bobevrs other than regulation of the $$$ we are once again left to fall back on the pension regulations and the amended provisions of regulation which bring within the scope of superannuation pension employees who opted for the voluntary retirement $$$ which will be clear from the explanatory memorandum. however the period of qualifying service has been retained as $$$$ for those opting for bobevrs and is treated differently from premature retirement where the minimum period of qualifying service has been fixed at $$$$ in keeping with regulation of the pension regulations. we are therefore of the view that not having completed the required length of qualifying service as provided under regulation of the regulations the respondent was not eligible for pension under the pension regulations of the appellant bank.being of this view the court allowed the appeal preferred by the bank. in bank of india and anr. v. k. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc the court referred to regulation of the employees ' pension regulations which had provided superannuation pension and regulation provided pension on voluntary retirement. after referring to series of decisions the court held . it is also a well -recognised principle of construction of a contract that it must be read as a whole in order to ascertain the true meaning of its several clauses and the words of each clause should be interpreted so as to bring them into harmony with the other provisions if that interpretation does no violence to the meaning of which they are naturally susceptible. north eastern railway co. v. lord $$$ ac. the fundamental position is that it is the banks who were responsible for formulation of the terms in the contractual $$$ that the optees of voluntary retirement under that $$$ will be eligible to pension under the pension regulations and therefore they bear the risk of lack of clarity if any. it is a well -known principle of construction of a contract that if the terms applied by party are unclear an interpretation against that party is preferred verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem. $$$ the court adverted to intention of the $$$ at the time of bringing out vrs. the court observed that if the intention was not to give pension as provided under regulation and particularly sub -regulation thereof they could have said so in the $$$ itself. the court also reproduced the communication dated.sent by the government of india ministry of finance department of economic affairs banking division to the personnel advisor indian $$$ association and came to hold as . things immediately become noticeable from the said communication. is that as per regulation of the pension regulations an employee can take voluntary retirement after $$$$ of qualifying service and become eligible for pension. the other thing is that the $$$ provides that the employees with $$$$ of service or $$$$ of age shall be eligible to take voluntary retirement under the $$$ and under regulation the employees having rendered $$$$ of service or completed $$$$ of age but not completed $$$$ of service shall not be eligible for pensionary benefits on taking voluntary retirement under the $$$. the use of the words such employees in the communication is referable to employees having rendered $$$$ of service but not completed $$$$ of service and therefore it was decided to bring an amendment in the regulations so that the employees having not completed $$$$ ' service do not lose the benefit of pension. the amendment in regulation as is reflected from the afore referred communication was intended to cover the employees who had rendered $$$$ ' service but not completed $$$$ ' service. it was not intended to cover the optees who had already completed $$$$ ' service as the provisions contained in regulation met that contingency.xxx. it was submitted that by such construction a class within the class would be created which is impermissible. we do not agree. if a special benefit under regulation is available to the employees who had completed $$$$ of service or more by no stretch of imagination can it be said that it is discriminatory to those employees who had completed $$$$ of service but not completed $$$$. in view of the provision contained in regulation if the optees who have not completed $$$$ get excluded from the weightage of $$$$ which has been given to the optees who have completed $$$$ of service or more it is no discrimination. such provision can neither be said to be arbitrary nor can be held to be violative of any constitutional or statutory provisions. the weightage of $$$$ under regulation is applicable to the optees having service of $$$$ or more. there is thus basis for additional benefit. merely because the employees who have completed $$$$ of service but not completed $$$$ of service are not entitled to weightage of $$$$ for qualifying service under regulation the employees who have completed $$$$ of service or more can not be denied such benefit.xxx. the precise effect of the pension regulations for the purposes of pension having been made part of the $$$ is that the pension regulations to the extent these are applicable must be read into the $$$. it is pertinent to bear in mind that interpretation clause of vrs states that the words and expressions used in the $$$ but not defined and defined in the rules / regulations shall have the same meaning respectively assigned to them under the rules / regulations. the $$$ does not define the expression retirement or voluntary retirement. we have therefore to fall back on the definition of retirement given in regulation whereunder voluntary retirement under regulation is considered to be retirement. regulation uses the expression voluntary retirement under these regulations. obviously for the purposes of the $$$ it has to be understood to mean with necessary changes in points of details. section of the contract act has no application to the present fact situation.xxx. it is true that vrs is a complete package in itself and contractual in nature. however in that package it has been provided that the optees in addition to gratia payment will also be eligible to other benefits inter alia pension under the pension regulations. the only provision in the pension regulations at the relevant time during the operation of vrs concerning voluntary retirement was regulation and sub -regulation thereof provides for weightage of addition of $$$$ to qualifying service for pension to those optees who had completed $$$$ ' service. it therefore can not be accepted that vrs did not envisage grant of pension benefits under regulation of the pension regulations to the optees of $$$$ ' service along with payment of gratia. the whole idea in bringing out vrs was to right size workforce which the banks had not been able to achieve despite the fact that the statutory regulations provided for voluntary retirement to the employees having completed $$$$ ' service. it was for this reason that vrs was made more attractive. vrs accordingly was an attractive package for the employees to go in for as they were getting special benefits in the form of gratia and in addition thereto inter alia pension under the pension regulations which also provided for weightage of $$$$ of qualifying service for the purposes of pension to the employees who had completed $$$$ ' service. in the said case the decision rendered in bank of baroda supra was distinguished by stating thus:. the decision of this court in bank of baroda is thus clearly distinguishable as the employee therein had not completed qualifying service much less $$$$ of service for being eligible to the weightage under regulation and can not be applied to the present controversy nor does that matter decide the question here to be decided in the present group of matters.eventually the court concluded thus:. we hold as it must be that the employees who had completed $$$$ of service and were pension optees and offered voluntary retirement under vrs and whose offers were accepted by the banks are entitled to addition of $$$$ of notional service in calculating the length of service for the purposes of that $$$ regulation of the pension regulations. the contrary views expressed by some of the high courts do not lay down the correct legal position. recently in state bank of patiala v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/88/$$$$$$$ / sc/88/$$$$ 8) scale the court was dealing with the state of bank of patiala voluntary retirement $$$ introduced by a circular dated.. the court quoted in extenso from k. $$$ and ors. supra. thereafter the court referred to clause and. clause thereof dealt with other benefits including pension or bank 's contribution to provident fund as the case maybe as per rules applicable on the relevant date on the basis of $$$$ of service rendered. the court also took note of regulation and of state bank of patiala employees pension regulations. regulation defined qualifying service and defined retirement. regulation referred to voluntary retirement in accordance with provisions contained in regulation of the regulations. reference was also made to regulation that defined qualifying service which stipulates that employee who has rendered a minimum of $$$$ in the bank from the date of his retirement or on the date on which he is deemed to have retired shall qualify for pension. reference was also made to regulation which prescribes how the broken period of service of less than year has to be computed. regulation thereof dealt with superannuation pension and regulation related to pension on voluntary retirement. scanning the various provisions of the regulations the court held thus:. the respondents completed more than $$$$ of service in the bank on the date of retirement therefore they fulfill the requirement of qualifying service as per regulation. it has not been disputed by appellant -bank that the respondents in all the appeals have completed much more than $$$$ $$$$s of service in the bank. for example respondent no. chand in c.a. no. of had joined the bank on may and relieved on st march. thus he had completed $$$$ $$$$s and days of qualifying service on the date of relieving from service. regulation of the pension regulations provides that if broken period is more than $$$$s it shall be treated as year. therefore all the respondents -writ petitirs having completed more than $$$$ and $$$$s of service in the bank they are to be treated to have completed $$$$ of service. the aforesaid question was neither raised nor decided in the case of bank of baroda or bank of india. in view of the aforesaid fact the appellant -bank can not derive the benefit of the decision of this court in bank of baroda as the employees who were parties before the court in the said case had not completed $$$$ of service. as per the decision of this court in bank of india the respondents -writ petitirs having completed $$$$ of service are entitled to the benefit of regulation. keeping in view the aforesaid pronouncements i shall advert to the regulations and the $$$ in question. from the aforesaid decisions it is graphically clear that the court has read into the scheme regulations governing the pension. in the case at hand as i find the regulation refers to categories $$$$ of pensionable service and attaining age of $$$$ or as on.an employee in service has completed $$$$ of pensionable service provided he has attained the age of -$$$$ or an employee to be in service of the bank on or after.and has completed $$$$ of pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$. the high court has held that the employees would be covered under part of clause a. i have already dealt with clause b. mr. rohtagi has heavily relied on clause. it really requires close scrutiny. it stipulates that a member shall be entitled to pension on completion of $$$$ of pensionable service irrespective of the age he has attained if the retirement is at his own request in writing. thus there is a distinction between a normal retirement and a voluntary retirement. a voluntary retirement stands in a distinction to retirement and also retirement which comes under clause which dwells on sanction of competent authority and member being incapacitated. a scheme has come into existence because of certain objectives. the objectives of the scheme were to have a balanced age -profile providing for mobility training development of skills and succession plans for higher -level positions to provide for an exit for employees who have an hst feeling that they should now retire and take rest or that there are better opportunities elsewhere to have overall reduction in the existing strength of the employees and to increase productivity and profitability. clause of the $$$ provides eligibility criterion. it reads as follows the $$$ will be open to all permanent employees of the bank except those specifically mentid as ineligible who have put in $$$$ of service or have completed $$$$ of age as on st december. age will be reckd on the basis of the date of birth as entered in the service record.clause deals with ineligibility which need not be referred to. clause deals with amount of -gratia. clause deals with other benefits which i have already referred to. clause clearly stipulates that an employee seeking voluntary retirement would have the benefit of pension in terms of state bank of india employees ' pension fund $$$s on the relevant date. in this context what i have noticed in the case of k. $$$ supra that the court has referred to the $$$ to understand the true meaning of several clauses formulation of the contractual scheme where reference has been made to pension regulations of the $$$ which were in appeal before this court and the special salient features of the scheme which stipulated that an employee whose application for voluntary retirement is accepted and relieved from the bank shall be eligible for contributory provident fund or own contribution of provident fund and pension in terms of the employees pension regulations in case of those who have opted for pension and have put in completed $$$$ of service in the bank. the court also referred to regulations and which deals with superannuation pension and the pension on voluntary retirement respectively. the court also took note of the fact that all employees who have completed $$$$ of service and the amendment in regulation which was carried out in with retrospective effect from.and the amendment inserted a proviso which provided that pension shall also be granted to an employee who opts to retire before attaining the age of superannuation but after having served for $$$$ of $$$$ in terms of any scheme that may be framed for the purpose by the bank 's board with the concurrence of the government. the court took note of the fact that the benefits provided under regulation were not found to be attractive by the employees and therefore the necessity arose for floating a special scheme i. vrs-000. the grievance of the optees in the case was that they were given the retiral benefits by the respondent -bank under vrs-000 save and except the benefit of pension under regulation. regulation in the case of those banks is as follows the qualifying service of an employee retiring voluntarily under this regulation shall be increased by a period not exceeding $$$$ subject to the condition that the total qualifying service rendered by such employee shall not in any case exceed -$$$$ and it does not take him beyond the date of superannuation. of the contentions canvassed by the bank was that the regulation does not cover the persons retired under vrs-000 which is dehors the statutory scheme for voluntary retirement. the counter submission on behalf of the employees was that by making provisions in the scheme that the optees would be eligible for the benefits in addition to the -gratia amount inter alia pension as per the pension regulations the employees understood that what was contemplated was pension under regulation and therefore any ambiguity in vrs ought to have been construed and harmonized with the intention of the parties regulation was the only regulation under the pension regulations applicable to the voluntary retirement and therefore regulation ipso facto became the terms of the contract and that each and every paragraph of regulation can be made applicable to an optees of more than $$$$ of service without coming into conflict with any provision of the scheme the notice period of $$$$s in regulation can be waived at the discretion of the banks. the court posed the questions as follows the principal question that falls for our determination is whether the employees having completed $$$$ of service of these banks bank of india punjab national bank punjab and sind bank union bank of india and united bank of india who had opted for voluntary retirement under vrs are entitled to addition of $$$$ of notional service in calculating the length of service for the purpose of the said $$$ regulation of the pension regulations. to examine the question posed the court thought it appropriate to examine the contract and the circumstances in which it was made in order to see whether or not from the nature of it the parties must have made their bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of things would continue to exist. i have already referred to clause of the $$$ which deals with other benefits. sub -clause of clause stipulates that an employee would be entitled to get pension in terms of the state bank of india employees pension fund $$$s on the relevant date. the high courts have placed reliance on the part of $$$. similar contention has been advanced before us. per contra mr. rohtagi would submit that it is $$$ which would be applicable. i find force in the said submission for $$$ deals with the concept of retirement and deals with the concept of retirement on request. in k. $$$ supra the $$$ was read into the $$$ in the absence of any other postulate. same is the case here and therefore i read the $$$ to the $$$. interpreting the regulations this court had said that it will apply in entirety and therefore benefit was extended in $$$. be it noted in the said regulation it was categorically provided that pensionary benefits should be available to a person seeking voluntary retirement if he has put in $$$$ of service. same is the provision here that is $$$$ of service irrespective of the age. as some doubts had arose a clarificatory circular was issued on.. relevant part has already been reproduced earlier. it has been clearly clarified that as per existing $$$s employees who have not completed $$$$ of pensionable service are not eligible for pension. this clarification is in consonance with the $$$s. the amendment facet which has come into existence afterwards is absolutely inconsequential as it deals with different facets of $$$. in this context reference to circular dated.is absolutely necessitous. the relevant part reads as follows in this connection queries have been raised whether an employee who submits his application for retirement under sbivrs can withdraw such an application subsequently. corporate centre have examined the issue and have advised that the scheme is purely voluntary. the role of the employee is active. it is his conscious decision and there will be no reason for his withdrawal of application at $$$$. however there could be few yet genuine cases where the employees would like to withdraw the application submitted under the scheme for various reasons. it has therefore been decided that the employee who has submitted an application for retirement under sbivrs may be permitted to withdraw the application on or before th february. for this purpose the employee will have to make a written request which must reach the branch manager / head of the department / head of the unit i. authority to whom the application for retirement under sbivrs has been submitted on or before.. the authority receiving the applications for withdrawal must forward it to the competent authority immediately but not later than $$$$ and obtain a confirmation to that effect from the competent authority. both the circulars were almost simultaneous and both were within the knowledge of the employees and if an employee desired to withdraw he could have d so as time was there till.. n of the respondents chose to withdraw. in the absence of withdrawal there can not be any trace of doubt that the employees would be governed by the rules existing at the time of floating of the $$$ which has to be read into the $$$ for the $$$ clearly stipulates that the employees availing the benefit of the $$$ would be entitled to pension as per the pension $$$s. i have already scanned the anatomy of the $$$s and i notice that there is a categorical distinction between retirement and voluntary retirement. in all the impugned judgments as i find the high courts have not appreciated the said distinction and applied the $$$ pertaining to normal retirement. if the decisions in k. $$$ supra and $$$ supra are read carefully it will go a long way to show that a voluntary retirement and retirement are distinguishable if the $$$ / regulations / $$$ distinguishes. in the case at hand it is clear as day that the $$$ carves out categories of retirement normal retirement on superannuation and retirement on request i. voluntary retirement ordinarily called the golden handshake and therefore the scheme was floated. in the instant case as i perceive the $$$ which is more beneficial was provided. it had the pension and the -gratia. however it had a condition as enumerated in the $$$ that if an employee had not completed $$$$ of service as per $$$ he would not get pension. in k. $$$ supra if an employee has completed $$$$ of service apart from pensionary benefits he would also get the benefit under regulation as stipulated therein. to elaborate unless is not entitled to pension the other additional benefits pertaining to pension do not arise. i may hasten to add that i am only concerned with the concept of voluntary retirement under the $$$s and the scheme and as i find the $$$ can not be interpreted as employees would be entitled to pension. that is neither the intention nor the spirit of the $$$ which has to be read into the scheme as a part of it. i have been apprised with regard to the relevant details of the respondents herein. it is as follows:4. in the case at hand unlike the decision of $$$ supra there is no provision for computation of broken period and therefore unless an employee has completed $$$$ of service he would not be entitled to pension. therefore i have no hesitation in holding that the impugned judgments and orders passed by various high courts namely high court of judicature at allahabad punjab & $$$ high court at chandigarh and high court of calcutta are unsustainable in law and accordingly i set aside the same. consequently the appeals are allowed and the impugned judgments and orders are set aside. in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.v. $$$ j. i had the opportunity to read the opinion of my brother judge justice $$$ and i am in respectful disagreement with the opinion rendered by him in the present appeals. leave granted in slp c no. of. the appellant bank -the state bank of india on the recommendation of the indian $$$ association in short iba introduced a scheme titled sbi $$$ in short sbi -vrs. this scheme was introduced by sbi despite there being provisions in the state bank of india employees ' provident fund $$$s for its employees to avail premature retirement / resignation / voluntary retirement. sbi -vrs was in operation for a limited period and was introduced by the appellant bank with package for the purpose specified in the scheme. it is the claim of the appellant bank that clause of the sbi -vrs provided for other benefits which is pension in terms of the sbi employees ' pension fund $$$s on the relevant date including the commuted value of pension. it is the further claim of the appellant bank that the employees who applied for retirement under sbi -vrs will be bound by the circular dated.issued by the competent authority viz.dy. managing director of the bank clarifying that..however as per existing rules employees who have not completed $$$$ of pensionable service are not eligible for pension.the respondents who were employees of the state bank of india applied for voluntary retirement under sbi -vrs on different dates between.and.. their applications got accepted and they stood retired from the bank service with effect from.. in the meanwhile a parallel development had taken place in the appellant bank with respect to its employees ' pension fund $$$s. on.the age of normal retirement of the employees working in the appellant bank was extended from $$$$ to $$$$. accordingly the service $$$ as well as $$$ of the sbi pension fund $$$s was amended wherein it was added that a member would be entitled to pension..if he is in the service of the bank on or after.after having completed $$$$ pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of $$$$. the respondents made representations where they sought pension under $$$ and were advised by the bank that they were not eligible for pension under $$$. the respondents filed $$$ before respective high courts of their jurisdictions namely the high court of judicature at allahabad high court of judicature at $$$ and the high court of punjab and $$$ which were allowed by both the single bench and the division bench of the high court. hence the appeals are filed by the appellant bank before this court. i am in respectful disagreement with the opinion rendered by my brother judge in the present appeals. however i intend to assign my reasons for the same based on certain relevant considerations. the issues arising for deliberation in this case are as under:(i whether the respondents in the present appeals are to be considered for pension benefits under the provisions of $$$ (i)(c of the state bank of india employee 's pension fund $$$s al as claimed by the appellant bank?(ii whether the state bank of india is entitled to retain its own employment $$$s which is not in consonance with the subsequent amendments made in the employee 's pension regulations in all the public sector undertaking $$$ in the light of the correspondence between the finance ministry and indian $$$ association?(iii under what legal provisions will the respondent employees be entitled to make their claims for pension?answer to point no. pension benefits accrue upon an employee on retirement from his employment. therefore we need to assess the definition of retirement before answering the question on pension benefits for the respondents herein. neither the state bank of india act nor the state bank of india employees ' pension fund $$$s defines retirement. therefore i am inclined to read the definition of retirement as has been mentid in the state bank of patiala employee 's pension regulation which provides for the definition of retirement from employment since the same is pari materia to the employees ' pension regulation. section of the regulation reads thus:(y retirement means cessation from the bank 's service-(a on attaining the age of superannuation specified in service regulations or settlements;(b on voluntary retirement in accordance with provisions contained in regulation of these regulations;(c on premature retirement by the bank before attaining the age of superannuation specified in service regulations or settlements.in the present case however clause of the definition will also be read in the light of the amended regulation which was intended to provide relief to the employees seeking voluntary retirement under the vrs after providing $$$$ of pensionable service. thus from the above definition is left with no doubt that the employees who availed vrs have retired from the bank as per the definitions.it is pertinent now to highlight the object and purpose of the sbi -vrs. at a meeting conducted on.between the finance minister and the chief executives of the public sector $$$ the human resource and manpower planning in public sector $$$ was reviewed. a committee was constituted to examine the issues confronting the public sector $$$ in this regard and to suggest suitable remedial measures. the committee had observed that high establishment costs and low productivity in public sector $$$ affect their profitability. it was hence necessary to convert their human resources into assets compatible with business strategies through a variety of measures including constant upgradation of skills achieving proper age and skill profile creating opportunities for lateral as well as vertical career progression and including fresh skilled personnel with technical and professional skills for new business opportunities. the data available with iba indicated that % of employees in public sector $$$ are in the + age group and only % are in the -$$$$ age group. this pattern of jobs in the public sector $$$ according to the committee had serious implications for the $$$ with reference to mobility training development of skills and succession plans for high level positions. this coupled with excess manpower wherever it exists would come in the way of induction of new skills and proper career progression.the committee had therefore recommended introduction of a $$$ that would assist the bank in their effort to optimize their human resources and achieve a balanced age skills profile in keeping in mind with the business strategies. the banks were further advised by the iba to implement the scheme in right earnest. from the memorandum of the $$$ presented by the appellant bank itself it is clear that the sbi -vrs scheme was introduced for the purpose of business enhancement and profitability of the bank itself and not for the benefits of the employees per se. the intention of the public sector banks including the appellant bank in introducing the vrs is rightfully highlighted in the decision of this court in bank of india v. k. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/04/$$$$$$$ / sc/04/$$$$ scc which read as under:6.. the banks decided to shed surplus manpower. by formulation of the special scheme vrs the banks intended to achieve their objective of rationalizing their force as they were overstaffed. the special scheme was thus oriented to lure the employees to go in for voluntary retirement. in this background the consideration that was to pass between the parties assumes significance and a harmonious construction to the scheme and the pension regulations therefore has to be given.emphasis supplied)in ordinary situation an employee who retires either on reaching the age of superannuation or by request in writing after completing the prescribed number of $$$$ become eligible to pension under the state bank of india employee 's pension $$$s. the pertinent provisions under the sbi employees pension $$$s relating to pension of employees read as under:. i. a member shall be entitled to a pension under these rules on retiring from the banks service -. after having completed years ' pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of years or if he is in the service of the bank on or after.after having completed years pensionable service provided that he has attained years or if he is in the service of the bank on or after.after having completed years pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of years.xxxc. after having completed years pensionable service irrespective of the age he shall have attained at his request in writing. this situation is altered temporarily by the introduction of the sbi -vrs. therefore it is also important to understand the framework of sbi -vrs. in the absence of the sbi -vrs the respondents had the option of seeking voluntary retirement under $$$ which in fact the respondents did not avail. instead they availed the sbi -vrs. it is therefore pertinent to see how the sbi -vrs was functioning and what the respondents seeking sbi -vrs might have reasonably foreseen while availing the scheme. when the application of voluntary retirement of respondent radhey shyam pandey was accepted by the appellant bank on.he still had about $$$$s services left and he was years and $$$$s old.as on st march when his voluntary retirement from service became effective he had been on pensionable service for years $$$$s and days. if the respondent had chosen to retire by superannuation after attaining years of age which was the normal age of retirement he would have put in a little more than years of pensionable service. he consequently would have become eligible to pension. however when he retired on.he still had and $$$$s short to complete years of service. it is pertinent to understand what prompted him to opt for the sbi -vrs at this stage. in clause of the scheme the incentive of the $$$ is mentid. it is an -gratia payment of days salary for $$$$ of completed service. since the respondent had finished years of service approximately he would have been entitled to $$$$s of salary as -gratia.pension on the other hand is calculated as half $$$$ 's salary per $$$$. therefore by utilizing the sbi -vrs although the respondent had given up months service still left he would have gained months incentive. to add to this he becomes eligible for pension then he in addition to -gratia will get half month 's salary as his pension from the time he retires. this can be considered as a good bargain from availing the sbi -vrs. on reasonable presumption it can be ascertained that it is this benefit provided by the sbi -vrs through -gratia payment along with pension which prompted the employees in availing the benefits of the scheme rather than retiring on superannuation under the $$$s. on the other hand if he is not entitled to pension then availing sbi -vrs is unwise since the respondent has given up his half month 's salary worth pension for his working period in return of months ' salary.sbi -vrs is admittedly a contract between the bank and its employees as has been recognized in the case of bank of india v. k. $$$ case mentid supra. the application of the $$$ meant that the bank employees agreed with the bank that it would be bound by the scheme thereby entering into a contract. however clause of sbi -vrs states:6. other benefits xxxxxx(c pension in terms of state bank of india employees ' pension fund $$$s on the relevant date including commuted value pension. considering that the incentives of sbi -vrs are distinct from the benefits provided under $$$ (i)(c of the state bank employees pension fund $$$s and also that clause of sbi -vrs does not specifically state that the pension benefits are to be provided under $$$ (i)(c of sbi employees pension fund $$$s the claim for pension by the respondents can not be decided solely on the basis of the provision of $$$ of the state bank of india employees ' pension $$$s.answer to point no. it has been claimed by the appellant bank that state bank of india has its own pension $$$s that are different from the employees ' pension regulations which operate in the other public sector banks. the claim made by the appellant bank that it is not bound by the pension regulations is premised on the assumption that the employees of the state bank of india form a distinct class of employment from the employees of the other public sector banks on the ground of reasonable and intelligible differentia.this conclusion by the appellant bank is not warranted since all the employees of public sector bank forms homogenous class since all the public sector banks which were formed under the banking companies acquisition and transfer of undertakings act and the banks under the banking companies acquisition and transfer of undertakings act are subject to the control of the central government. it is pertinent to note that section of both -the banking companies acquisition and transfer of undertakings acts of and and section of the state bank of india act vest the power on the central government to make consistent rules for all the public sector banks.section of state bank of india act reads thus:0. power of central government to make regulations the central board may after consultation with the reserve bank and with the previous sanction of the central government by notification in the official gazette make regulations not inconsistent with this act and the rules made thereunder to provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this act.in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such regulation may provide for -$$$ the establishment and maintenance of superannuation pension provident or other funds for the benefit of the employees of the state bank or of the dependent of such employees or for the purposes of the state bank and the granting of superannuation allowances annuities and pensions payable out of any such fund;]64. the central government through a letter dated.directed the indian banks association to formulate a uniform norm for pensions for employees voluntarily retiring under sbi -vrs and the same was formulated by the indian banks association on.. therefore the state bank of india is bound by the directions issued in this regard by the indian banks association under section of the state bank of india act. the appellant bank state bank of india is an instrumentality of the state as has been held by this court in the case of bank of india and ors. v. o.p. swarnakar and ors. $$$ / sc/7/00$$$ / sc/7/00 scc which reads as $$$..but the state bank of india as also the nationalized banks are states within the meaning of article of the constitution of india. the services of the workman are also governed by several standing orders and bipartite settlements which have the force of law. the banks therefore can not take recourse to hire and fire for the purpose of terminating the services of the employees. the banks are required to act fairly and strictly in terms of the norms laid down therefor. their actions in this behalf must satisfy the test of $$$ and of the constitution of india.therefore the appellant bank can not engage in acts which are antithetical to equality. in the case of e.p. royappa v. state of $$$ manu / $$$ / sc/080/7 air sc the constitution bench of this court held as under equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it can not be cribbed cabined and confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits. from a positivistic point of view equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. in fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of article and if it affects any matter relating to public employment it is also violative of article. $$$ and strike at arbitrariness in state action an ensure fairness and equality of treatment. they require that state action must be based on valent relevant principles applicable alike to all similarly situate and it must not be guided by any extraneous or irrelevant considerations because that would be denial of equality. where the operative reason for state action as distinguished from motive inducing from the antechamber of the mind is not legitimate and relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of permissible considerations it would amount to mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by $$$ and. even though the sbi -vrs is in the nature of contract it has to be interpreted under the scanner of article of the constitution of india. in the process of implementation of the $$$ on its own terms the appellant bank being an associate bank of the indian banks organization it can not set rules and procedures which deviates from the standard and safeguards set by the central government in consensus with the indian banks association. it is the claim of the appellant bank that the sbi -vrs provides the optees with handsome -gratia amount on retirement. it does not however mean that the appellant is entitled to deprive the respondent of his pension on the ground that he has been given handsome -gratia amount under the scheme. pension received by an employee upon his retirement is not a bounty as has been held in the case of deokinandan prasad v. state of bihar manu / sc/068/$$$$manu / sc/068/$$$$ scr as under pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the government and that on the other hand the right to pension is a valuable right... the same proposition of law was reiterated by the constitution bench of this court in the case of d.s. nakara v. union of india manu / sc/07/manu / sc/07/ scc wherein this court held as under:0. the antiquated notion of pension being a bounty a gratuitous payment depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not claimable as a right and therefore no right to pension can be enforced through court has been swept under the carpet by the decision of the constitutional bench in deokinandan prasad v. state of bihar wherein this court authoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of the government but is governed by the rules and a government servant coming within rules is entitled to claim pension. it was further held that the grant of pension does not depend upon anyone 's discretion. it is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the authority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows to the officer not because of the order but by the virtue of rules. this view was reaffirmed in state of punjab v. iqbal singh.emphasis supplied)therefore depriving the respondents seeking sbi -vrs of their right to pension solely on the ground that they have availed voluntary retirement under a scheme while providing less than years of service and also on the ground that they have been provided with handsome -gratia amount on their retirement is arbitrary and attracts the wrath of article of the constitution of india. this is particularly so because sbi -vrs was introduced for the benefit of the public sector banks which included the appellant bank. it was not a welfare scheme which provided the respondents with multiple offers to choose from. therefore the appellant bank at this stage can not absolve itself from the responsibility of granting the respondents what is due to them by virtue of providing pensionable services on the pretext of having provided -gratia amount. in another case of $$$ v. delhi development authority manu / sc/04/$$$$manu / sc/04/$$$$ supp scr this court held as under to overdo classifications is to undo equality. the idea of similarity or dissimilarity of situations of persons to justify classifications can not rest on merely differentia which may by themselves be rational or logical but depends on whether the differences are relevant to the goals sought to be reached by the law which seeks to classify. the justification of the classification must needs therefore to be sought beyond the classification. all marks of distinction do not necessarily justify classification irrespective of the relevance or nexus of objects sought to be achieved by the law imposing the classification.emphasis. in the case on hand the classification between employees who have voluntarily retired under the sbi -vrs and those who have retired under the same scheme introduced by the other public sector banks is not rational since they constitute the employees of the appellant bank into a distinct class on the basis of the vrs scheme introduced by the appellant bank and the same scheme introduced by other public sector banks with no intelligible differentia. the payment of -gratia can not be held against the employees since it can not be expected of a person to give up his service before superannuation without reasonable incentives. what the appellant bank intends to show as the benefit of the employees seeking vrs under the scheme is actually meant for the benefit of the appellant bank itself. in setting up schemes such as the sbi -vrs the appellant bank which is the instrumentality of the state under article of the constitution can not deviate from its constitutional duties as has been held in the case of d.s. nakara v. union of india supra):6. having set out clearly the society which we propose to set up the direction in which the state action must move the welfare state which we propose to build up the constitutional goal of setting up a socialist state and the assurance in the directive principles of state policy especially of security in old age at least to those who have rendered useful service during $$$$ it is indisputable nor was it questioned that pension as a retirement benefit is in consonance with and in furtherance of the goals of the constitution. the goals for which pension is paid themselves give a fillip and push to the policy of setting up a welfare state because by pension the socialist goal of security of cradle to grave is assured at least when it is mostly needed and least available namely in the fall of life. moreover this decision of the appellant bank to distinguish between sets of employees goes against article of the constitution of india which directs the state to make policies to ensure equal pay for equal work. the appellant bank being an instrumentality of the state is not permitted to make such discriminations. hence the appellant bank is liable to implement the amendments made by the indian banks association to accommodate the grant of pension to those employees who sought voluntary retirement through sbi -vrs.answer to point no. under $$$ of the state bank of india employees ' pension $$$s an employee 's entitlement to pension accrues on retiring from the bank service on of the following conditions under $$$ after having completed years pensionable services provided that he has attained the age of years or(b if he was in the service on or after.then after having completed years of service provided that he has attained the age of years or(c if he was in the service on or after.then after having completed years pensionable service provided that he has attained the age of years.under rule ()(c):(d after years of pensionable service at his request in writing where the entitlement is to proportionate pension.on the other hand the un -amended employee 's pension regulations provide for pension under the following condition regulation reads as under:. superannuation pensions superannuation pension shall be granted to an employee who has retired on his attaining the age of superannuation specified in the service regulations and settlements.regulation reads as under:. pension on voluntary retirement:( on or after the st day of november at any time after an employee has completed years of qualifying service he may by giving notice of not less than months in writing to the appointing authority retire from service.... it can be observed that the state bank of india employees ' pension rules and the un -amended employee 's pension regulation are consistent in so far as both rules set the eligibility of pension on voluntary retirement service only after years of pensionable service. however it is imperative to understand the amendment which the correspondence between the finance ministry and indian banks association following the introduction of the sbi -vrs brought about. by a letter f. no. dated.written by the finance ministry to the indian banks association the ministry recommended to the iba to suggest amendments to regulation of the pension regulations in the following terms i am directed to refer to this division 's letter no. ir dated --conveying the government 's no objection for circulation of $$$ in public sector banks. the scheme inter alia provides that employees with year of service or years of age shall be eligible to take voluntary retirement under the scheme. as per the provisions contained in regulation of the pension regulations an employee can take voluntary retirement after years of qualifying service and thereafter becomes eligible for pension. thus employees having rendered years of service or completing years of age but not having completed years of service shall not be eligible for pensionary benefits on taking voluntary retirement under the scheme.in order to ensure that such employees do not lose the benefits of pension iba may work out modalities and suggest amendments if any required to be made in the pension regulations to ensure that these employees also get the benefits of pension.pursuant to this correspondence the indian banks association suggested an amendment to the regulations in the following terms indian $$$ floorblock veer nariman roadmumbai-40000pd / cir//g/g4/december voluntary retirement scheme in public sector banks amendments to bank employees ' pension

voluntary retirement is entitled for the benefits of cpf pension gratuity and encashment of accumulates privilege leaves as per rules.bank employees ' pension regulations do not have provisions enabling payment of pension to an employee who retires before attaining the age of superannuation except under circumstances as in regulations and. we had therefore taken up with the government the need to incorporate necessary provisions in the pension regulations by way of amendments to regulation so that employees who retire as above under special / ad hoc schemes formulated by the banks after serving for a prescribed minimum period would be eligible for pro rata pension.government of india has after examining the proposal conveyed its approval and desired that iba advise banks to make necessary amendments to their pension regulations as in the annexure. we request banks to take note accordingly.please note that with the above amendments employees who apply for voluntary retirement after having rendered minimum years of service under a special / ad hoc scheme formulated with the specific approval of the government and the board of directors will be eligible for pro

the age of superannuation but after having served for a minimum period of years in terms of any scheme that may be framed for the purpose by the bank 's board with the concurrence of the government.this court in the case of bank of india v. k. $$$ supra further clarified the intention behind amendment of regulation and its retrospective application. the relevant paragraphs read as under:40..the amendment in regulation as is reflected from the afore referred communication was intended to cover the employees who had rendered years ' service but not completed years ' service... even if it be assumed that by insertion of the proviso in regulation in the year with effect from --all classes of employees under vrs were intended to be covered such amendment in regulation needs to be harmonized with regulation... while answering point no in favour of the respondents i held that the state bank of india should implement the amendment made to rule of the employees pension regulation in granting pension to the employees seeking voluntary retirement under sbi -vrs.i therefore answer point no. in favour of the respondents and direct the appellant bank to grant pension to the employees seeking voluntary retirement under the sbi -vrs after completing years of pensionable service. therefore the respondent radhey shyam pandey having completed years months and days of service respondent m.p. $$$ having completed years and months of service and the respondent r.p. nigam having completed years and months of service become eligible for pension as per the amended regulation of employees pension rules. by virtue of power vested in this court under article constitution of india i hold that the pension relief is also extended to all the other employees who have
