v.n. khare cji. on march when these appeals came up for hearing before a bench of this court the bench was of the view that these matters require to be heard and decided by a bench of judges. it is in this way these appeals have come up for hearing before us. before us there are sets of civil appeals -set of appeals is at the instance of the claimants whose land has been acquired and the same is directed against the order and judgment passed by the allahabad high court partly allowing the appeals of u.p. awas evam vikas $$$ hereinafter referred to as the $$$ and the other set of appeals is at the instance of the $$$. the uttar pradesh legislature has been enacted uttar pradesh avas evam vikas $$$ $$$ hereinafter referred to as the $$$. the awas evam vikas $$$ in short the $$$ was constituted under the $$$. of the duties assigned to the $$$ under the $$$ is to frame and carry out housing schemes by acquiring land. in that view of the matter the $$$ issued a notification dated nd october under section of the $$$ proposing to acquire.acres of land in villages majhole and majholi both adjacent to town of moradabad. the said notification under section was followed by a notification dated may issued under section of the $$$ which corresponds to notification under section of the land acquisition act. on nd september the special land acquisition officer gave an award in respect of the land acquired by the $$$. the land acquisition officer granted different rates of compensation in respect of the lands so acquired. the claimants were not satisfied with the compensation offered to them by the collector and therefore they sought reference before the reference court. the reference court by an order and judgment dated th april enhanced the compensation from rs. per sq. metre to rs. per sq. metre and also granted solatium at the rate of per cent interest at the rate of per cent and additional amount under section of the land acquisition act. simultaneously the reference court deducted per cent of the compensation towards the development deductions. the $$$ aggrieved against the aforesaid order and judgment and preferred appeals before the high court. the high court divided the entire acquired land into categories by applying belting system. the high court granted solatium at the rate of per cent instead of per cent as awarded by the reference court and also interest at the rate of per cent for year and per cent for $$$$. consequently appeals were partly allowed. we are taken through the appeals preferred by the $$$. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ relied upon decisions of this court in prakash $$$ v. state of gujarat and ors.$$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ airsc4 the state of tamil nadu and ors. v. $$$ and ors.$$$ / $$$ / sc/04/ airsc4 and the state of madhya pradesh v. g.c. $$$$$$ / sc/0/4$$$ / sc/0/4 and submitted that the grant of compensation to the claimants under the provisions of land acquisition act was wholly errous in view of the fact that the $$$ was enacted by the state legislature whereas the land acquisition act was enacted by the parliament the provisions of the $$$ could not have been held to be ultra vires article of the constitution of india. the learned counsel further contended that in view of the factual matrix involved the decisions of this court in u.p. avas evam vikas $$$ v. $$$ and anr.$$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ wherein this court was not concerned with the construction of section of $$$ read with the schedule appended thereto vis -a -vis section of the land acquisition act the matter required reconsideration by this court. the learned counsel also urged that having regard to the fact that clause of the schedule appended to the $$$ specifically refers to the quantum of solatium payable by the state on acquisition of the land enhancement thereof by invoking the provisions of land acquisition act can not be held to be justified. $$$ counsel also contended that the doctrine of incorporation by reference in a case of this nature would not lead to the conclusion that as and when any amendment is made in the parliamentary act the state legislation would stand automatically amended. in any event having regard to the phraseology used in section of the $$$ such a construction is not permissible. the $$$ was enacted for constitution of the $$$ to provide for the establishment incorporation and functioning of a housing and development board in uttar pradesh. the $$$ indisputably has power to acquire land. acquisition of such land for the purpose of fulfilling the object of the said act therefore would constitute public purpose. sub -section of section of $$$ provides that inter alia for the purpose of land acquisition act the $$$ shall be deemed to be a local authority. section of the $$$ empowers the $$$ to acquire land which reads as under:-". power to acquire land -any land or any interest therein required by the board for any of the purposes of this act may be acquired under the provisions of the land acquisition act act no. i of as amended in its application to uttar pradesh which for this purpose shall be subject to the modifications specified in the schedule to this act.if any land in respect of which betterment fee has been levied under this act is subsequently required for any of the purposes of this act such levy shall not be deemed to prevent the acquisition of the land under the land acquisition act act no. i of. it is true that ordinarily equality clause enshrined in article of the constitution of india can not be invoked in the matter of enforcement of a state legislation vis -a -vis a parliamentary legislation and/or the legislation of an another state. in g.c. $$$ supra it was held that article does not authorise striking down of a law of state on the ground that in contrast with a law of another state on the same subject its provisions are discriminatory nor does it contemplate a law enacted by parliament or by the state legislature dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the enactments as the sources of authority for the statutes being different article can have no application. the decision in $$$ supra is also on the same line. but the said decisions have no application in the instant case. the $$$ provides for acquisition of land in terms of land acquisition act. by reason of legal fiction created under the $$$ the $$$ is deemed to be a local authority. the parishad invokes the provisions of the land acquisition act in its capacity as a local authority under the land acquisition act. the state issue a notification in terms of section of the $$$ and make declaration in terms of section thereof which are on similar terms as contained in sections and of the land acquisition act respectively. the purpose for acquisition of land both under the parliamentary act and the state act is the same. an order of acquisition is to be passed only by the state. in nagpur improvement trust v. vithal rao and ors. scr a bench of this court categorically held that an owner of the land is not concerned with the nature of the public purpose that is whether land is acquired for a hospital or for school or for housing. so long as the acquiring authority and the public purposes where for lands are acquired are the same in view of the fact that provisions have been made for payment of compensation in terms of the provisions of land acquisition act although acquisition is made under the state act but if higher amount of compensation is payable under the latter such higher amount of compensation will be payable. it was held:"it is equally immaterial whether it is acquisition act or another acquisition act under which the land is acquired. if the existence of acts could enable the state to give owner different treatment from another equally situated the owner who is discriminated against can claim the protection of article. it may be as contended by the learned counsel that therein this court was concerned with enactments of states but the principles laid down therein would be attracted having regard to the fact that although acquisition is to be made in terms of the $$$ but the procedures laid down therefore under the land acquisition act are to be followed and in both the cases the acquiring authority is the state. this court in $$$ supra categorically held that the provisions of the land acquisition act is to be read into the provisions of the $$$. the said question again came up for consideration again before a bench in nagpur improvement trust v. vasant rao and ors. $$$ / $$$$$$ / $$$. in the said case also identical contentions were raised but this court did not find any merit therein. this court followed nagpur improvement trust v. vithal raomanu / sc/05/7manu / sc/05/7 as also $$$ supra holding:". clause of the schedule which effects several modifications in section of the land acquisition act modifies sub -section thereof as follows the full stop at the end of sub -section of section shall be deemed to be changed to a colon and the following proviso shall be deemed to be added -provided that this sub -section shall not apply to any land acquired under the nagpur improvement trust act except(a buildings in the actual occupation of the owner or occupied free of rent by a relative of the owner and land appurtenant thereto and(b gardens not let to tenants but used by the owners as a place of resort. it will thus be seen that the state acts follow the same pattern and incorporate a common scheme. the provisions of the land acquisition act with certain modifications are made applicable to acquisitions made for purposes of execution of the schemes under those acts. there is also a striking similarity between schedules to the punjab and nagpur acts and even though they may not be identical they are in pari materia. the schedule to the u.p. act is not as detailed but that is due to the fact that many of the modifications in by the provisions of the act itself. the schedule modifies section and of the land acquisition act and adds a new section which is identical to section inserted in punjab and nagpur acts. it also gives to the notifications under section and 32(1 of the u.p. act the same effect as notifications published under sections and respectively of the land acquisition act. in vasant rao supra this court as noticed hereinbefore followed jainul islam supra $$$. this court in u.p. avas evam vikas parishad v. jainul islam and anr. supra noticed the scheme of the u.p. act and observed that section of the u.p. act makes a reference to the provisions of the land acquisition act as amended in its application to uttar pradesh and has laid down that any land or any interest therein required by the parishad for any of the purposes of the ahiniyam may be acquired under the provisions of the land acquisition act as amended in its application to the state of uttar pradesh which for this purpose has to be subject to the modifications specified in the schedule to the u.p. act. similar provisions are found in other enactments and reference was made to the $$$ improvement act whereunder the board of trustees of the $$$ improvement trust was entrusted with very vide powers for the purpose of carrying out improvement schemes within the municipal limits of $$$. after noticing the provisions of the calcutta improvement act this court noticed the judgment of the privy council in secretary of state v. hindustan cooperative insurance society ltd. supra in which the question arose -whether the amendment in the land acquisition act was applicable so as to confer a right of appeal to the privy council against the judgment of the high court in an appeal from the tribunal. the said question was answered in the negative by the privy council. this court quoted the following passages appearing in secretary of state v. hindustan cooperative insurance society ltd. supra.the modifications are contained partly in the body of the act and partly in a schedule attached to the act. they are numerous and substantial and the effect is in their lordship 's opinion to enact for the purposes of the local act a special law for the acquisition of land by the trustees within the limited area over which their powers extend.     their lordships regard the local act as doing nothing more than incorporating certain provisions from an existing act and for convenience of drafting doing so by reference to that act instead of setting out for itself at length the provisions which it was desired to adopt. therein this court considered the various other decisions relied upon by learned counsel and observed. so far as the u.p. act is concerned the judgment in u.p. avas evam vikas parishad v. jainul islam and anr. supra answers all the questions raised before us. it has been held that so far as the u.p. act is concerned the land acquisition act as modified stands incorporated in the u.p. act. however as a matter of construction it was held that section of the u.p. act while incorporating the provisions of the land acquisition act intended to apply to acquisition made under the u.p. act the beneficial amendments that may be brought about for determination and payment of compensation in the land acquisition act. there was nothing in the u.p. act which precluded the court from adopting such a construction and this was necessary to save the act from the vice of arbitrary and hostile discrimination. this court also found that the provisions of the nagpur act with which we are concerned were similar to the provisions of the u.p. act. this aspect of the matter has been discussed in paragraph of the report. we have also considered the provisions of the nagpur act as well as the provisions of the punjab act. we are satisfied that the aforesaid acts as well as the u.p. act have a common scheme and pattern. all the legislations relate to town planning and development and each of them specifies the various schemes that may be undertaken. for acquisition of land for the purposes of any of the schemes under the said acts the land acquisition act has been made applicable with certain modifications as contained in the schedule to the said acts which are numerous and substantial. the modifications made are also similar. we have found no distinction in the acts which may have a bearing on the question relating to legislative incorporation of the land acquisition act in the state acts. we are therefore of the view that what has been held by this court in u.p. avas evam vikas parishad v. jainul islam and anr. supra with regard to u.p. act holds good for the punjab act as well as the nagpur act. consequently we are unable to subscribe to the view taken in bhatinda improvement trust v. balwant singh and ors. supra that the provisions of the land acquisition act have not been incorporated into the punjab act and that they have merely been cited or referred to in the punjab act. the contention to the effect that article of the constitution is not attracted was also negatived. in our view reliance placed by learned counsel on prakash $$$ supra is totally mis -placed. this court therein was considering the provisions of acquisition under the bombay town planning act. referring to the scheme of town planning act it was held that the provisions of payment of compensation under the land acquisition act can not be held to have any application. the court held that the scheme of acquisition under the town improvement act and the land acquisition act are different. it was noticed that section of the act provides for determination of the cost of the scheme the development charges to be levied and the contribution to be made by the local authority etc. it was further noticed that there were types of taking over of land under the town improvement act ly under section secondly under section and thirdly under section of the act each being a part of the single scheme but each having a specific object and public purpose to be achieved. it was noticed:"while as regards the determination of compensation it may be possible to apply the provisions of the land acquisition act with some modification as provided in the schedule to the act in the case of lands acquired either under section or under section of the act in the case of lands which are needed for the local authority under the town planning scheme which authorises allotment of reconstituted plots to persons from whom original plots are taken it is difficult to apply the provisions of the land acquisition act. on the said findings alone it was held that the provisions of the land acquisition act would not be attracted. as regard the issue as to whether article of the constitution would be attracted or not it was noticed that in terms of the provisions of the town planning scheme there is no option under that act to acquire the land under the land acquisition act. in the instant case for the purpose of providing housing facilities to the people lands undoubtedly can be acquired both under the land acquisition act as also under the $$$. furthermore section inserted in the $$$ also makes a difference. in venkat rao supra insertion of section was noticed which as noticed hereinbefore provides that the land has to be acquired by the collector for the government and thereafter it is transferred by the government to the mahapalika only on payment of its costs. for the aforesaid reasons we do not find any merit in the appeals filed by the parishad. coming to the appeals filed by the claimants we do not find any infirmity in the judgment and order of the high court. hence we find that both sets of appeals have no merit. at the end mr. g.l. sanghi learned senior counsel appearing for some of the claimants urged that the high court has committed a clerical mistake in not awarding additional compensation. once the high court had held that the amending act of was applicable for the grant of compensation it appears that some clerical error crept into the judgment of the high court in not awarding additional compensation. in fact in accordance with the conclusion at which we have arrived the claimants are also entitled to the additional compensation under section of the land acquisition act. further the claimants are also entitled to interest at the rate of per cent for $$$$ and per cent for $$$$. with the aforesaid modification both sets of appeals stand disposed of. there will be no order as to costs.
