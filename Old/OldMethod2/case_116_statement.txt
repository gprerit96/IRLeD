. the $$$ is being tried before the sessions judge jodhpur for offences punishable under sections  indian penal code sections and juvenile justice care and protection of children act and sections protection of children from sexual offences act. as earlier application for bail filed by him having been declined a application was moved before the trial court which too came to be rejected by the said court. the matter was then taken up before the high court who has concurred with the view taken by the trial court and dismissed the plea for bail. the present special leave petition calls in question the correctness of the said order. when this petition initially came up before us on.mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the $$$ submitted that although several witnesses for the prosecution had already been examined at the trial the $$$ shall be satisfied if he is permitted to refresh his application for enlargement on bail after the examination of the material witnesses. the prosecution has it is common ground named material witnesses in terms of a list filed before this court out of whom have already been examined and cross -examined while the is still under cross -examination although the $$$ 's counsel has concluded the cross examination on his part. this implies that there are still other witnesses apart from the one who is under cross -examination that need to be examined at the trial. mr. khurshid 's submission that the $$$ will be satisfied if he is allowed to refresh his application for enlargement on bail after examination of the material witnesses clearly implied that the application for bail on merit was as good as withdrawn till such time the material witnesses were examined before the trial court. what had all the same been argued by mr. khurshid was that the medical condition of the $$$ called for immediate surgery for which purpose he had placed reliance upon a certificate issued by dr. maheep $$$. it was argued that the $$$ would like to be evaluated at kumud chawla gamma knife centre goodwill hospital and research centre noida. we had in view of this submission made at the bar directed constitution of a medical board by the director of ai -ims to review the medical papers relevant to the $$$ 's present condition and to submit a report as to whether there was any need for surgery as suggested by the $$$ 's doctor. we had left it open to the medical board to call the $$$ for a clinical examination should if it considered necessary to do so. a board comprising as many as doctors from different specialities was accordingly constituted by the aiims before whom the $$$ was produced in person for a clinical examination apart from evaluation of his medical papers. the board has based on their clinical examination and investigations submitted a report dated.in which it has opined:"on basis of above examination and investigations by the medical board he was diagnosed to be suffering from $$$ with degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with hypothyroidism and benign hyperplasia of prostate. radiological and blood investigation reports are enclosed in original.at present none of the above mentioned disease require surgical management but requires appropriate routine medical management on opd basis.the medical board concluded at.p.. it is evident from that above that the $$$ does not require any surgical intervention at this stage and that the diseases which he is found to be suffering from like $$$ degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine hypothyroidism and benign hyperplasia of prostate can be handled in the opd. we have no reason to doubt or reject the opinion given by the experts from the premier medical institute of the country. mr. $$$ learned senior counsel all the same argued that some of the diseases namely degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with hypothyroidism and benign hyperplasia of prostate was developed by the $$$ during incarnation. there is nothing before us to support even that submission of $$$. be that as it may since the board has suggested only medical management on opd basis there is no compelling reason for us to enlarge the $$$ on bail at this stage when the $$$ is facing serious charges some of which are punishable by imprisonment for life. mr. $$$ at this stage submitted that the $$$ has been earlier treated by dr. $$$ arogayadham hospital and would like to continue with the treatment advised by him. there is no serious objection to that prayer being allowed. we also see no reason why the doctor named by $$$ for the $$$ should not be allowed to visit the $$$ in jail to administer such treatment as is considered necessary of course at the risk of the $$$. it was next contended by mr. $$$ that the witnesses described as material witnesses by the prosecution have not appeared despite efforts made by the trial court. he submits that in any case those witnesses are not material for purpose of determining whether the incident in question had indeed taken place. on behalf of the respondent it was submitted that the respondents had named only out of a total of witnesses as material witnesses of whom are already examined as mentioned earlier while the remaining will be produced no sooner the witness correctly made cross -examination is discharged. in that view all that we need to say is that the trial court shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure that the trial of the $$$ does not get delayed unduly because of nonavailability of witnesses. the trial will we are confident take all such steps as are necessary to have the witnesses served and produced before the trial court on such dates as may be fixed by it. with these observations this special leave petition fails and is hereby dismissed. needless to say that after the recording of the material witnesses is complete the petitioner shall be free to move a fresh application for grant of bail to him. in case any such application is made the trial court shall consider the same on its merits. we express no opinion on the merits of any such application.slp c nos. of and -of in may.
