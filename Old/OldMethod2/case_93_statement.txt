t.s. thakur c.j.i. a -judge bench of this $$$ has by an order dated st april referred these transfer petitions to a constitution bench to examine whether this $$$ has the power to transfer a civil or criminal case pending in any $$$ in the state of jammu and kashmir to a $$$ outside that state and vice versa. out of transfer petitions placed before us pursuant to the reference order seek transfer of civil cases from or to the state of jammu and kashmir while the remaining seek transfer of criminal cases from the state to $$$s outside that state. the transfer petitions are opposed by the respondents inter alia on the ground that the provisions of section of the $$$ of civil procedure and section of the $$$ of criminal procedure which empower this $$$ to direct transfer of civil and criminal cases respectively from state to the other do not extend to the state of jammu and kashmir and can not therefore be invoked to direct any such transfer. the transfer petitions are also opposed on the ground that the jammu and $$$ of civil procedure and the jammu and $$$ of criminal procedure do not contain any provision empowering the supreme $$$ to direct transfer of any case from that state to a $$$ outside the state or vice versa. it is also contended on behalf of the respondents that in the absence of any provision empowering this $$$ to direct transfer of civil or criminal cases from or to the state of jammu and kashmir no such power can be invoked or exercised by this $$$. it is further urged that the provisions of $$$ of the constitution which empowers this $$$ to transfer a case pending before high $$$ to itself or to another high $$$ also has no application to the cases at hand as the constitution nd amendment act which inserted the said provision itself has no application to the state of jammu and kashmir. it is argued that in the absence of any enabling provision in the $$$ of civil and criminal procedure or in the constitution of india or the state constitution for that matter a litigant has no right to seek transfer of a civil or a criminal case pending in the state of jammu and kashmir to a $$$ outside the state or vice versa. on behalf of the $$$s it was on the other hand submitted that while sections of the $$$ of civil procedure and of $$$ of criminal procedure as applicable to the rest of the country have no application to the state of jammu and kashmir there was no specific or implied prohibition in the said codes against the exercise of power of transfer by the supreme $$$ under the constitution or under any other provision of the law whatsoever. it was urged that inapplicability of the central civil and/or $$$ of criminal procedure to the state of jammu and kashmir or the absence of an enabling provision in the state $$$ of civil and/or criminal procedure does not necessarily imply that this $$$ can not exercise the power of transfer if the same is otherwise available under the provisions of the constitution. so also the inapplicability of $$$ to the state of jammu and kashmir by reason of non -extension of the constitution nd amendment act to that state does not constitute a disability leave al a prohibition against the exercise of the power of transfer if such power could otherwise be traced to any other source within constitutional framework. the $$$ of civil procedure and so also the $$$ of criminal procedure hereinafter referred to as central $$$s as applicable to the rest of the country specifically exclude the application thereof to the state of jammu and kashmir. this is evident from section of $$$ of civil procedure which deals with short title commencement and extent. short title commencement and extent- this act may be cited as the $$$ of civil procedure. it shall come into force on the day of january. it extends to the whole of india except- a the state of jammu and kashmir the state of nagaland and the tribal areas provided that the state government concerned may by notification in the official gazette extend the provisions of this $$$ or any of them to the whole or part of the state of nagaland or such tribal areas as the case may be with such supplemental incidental or consequential modifications as may be specified in the notification. explanation -in this clause tribal areas means the territories which immediately before the st day of january were included in the tribal areas of assam as referred to in paragraph of the schedule to the constitution. in relation to the amindivi islands and the east godavari west godavari and visakhapatnam agencies in the state of andhra pradesh and the union territory of lakshadweep the application of this $$$ shall be without prejudice to the application of any rule or regulation for the time being in force in such islands agencies or such union territory as the case may be relating to the application of this $$$.emphasis supplied). to the same effect is section of the $$$ of criminal procedure which reads as under short title extent and commencement. short title extent and commencement.this act may be called the $$$ of criminal procedure.it extends to the whole of india except the state of jammu and kashmir provided that the provisions of this $$$ other than those relating to chapters viii x and xi thereof shall not apply- a to the state of nagaland to the tribal areas but the concerned state government may by notification apply such provisions or any of them to the whole or part of the state of nagaland or such tribal areas as the case may be with such supplemental incidental or consequential modifications as may be specified in the notification. explanation.this section tribal areas means the territories which immediately before the st day of january were included in the tribal areas of assam as referred to in paragraph of the schedule to the constitution other than those within the local limits of the municipality of shillong.emphasis supplied). $$$ for the respondents in the light of the above are perfectly justified in contending that the provisions of section of the $$$ of civil procedure and that of section of the criminal procedure as applicable to the rest of india can not be invoked by any litigant seeking transfer of any case to or from the state of jammu and kashmir. it is equally true that jammu and kashmir $$$ of civil procedure svt. and jammu and kashmir $$$ of criminal procedure svt. also do not have any provision empowering this $$$ to direct transfer of any case civil or criminal from any $$$ in the state to a $$$ outside that state or vice versa. resort to the central or state $$$s of civil and criminal procedures for directing transfer of cases to or from the state is therefore ruled out. to that extent therefore the contentions urged on behalf of the respondents are well -founded and legally unexceptionable. the question however is whether independent of the provisions contained in the $$$s of civil and criminal procedure is there a source of power which this $$$ can invoke for directing transfer of a case from the state of jammu and kashmir or vice versa. on behalf of the $$$s it was contended that even when the central $$$s of civil and criminal procedure have no applicability to the state of jammu and kashmir and even when the state $$$s of civil and criminal procedure do not contain any provision empowering this $$$ to direct transfer it does not mean that this $$$ is helpless in making an order of transfer in appropriate case where such transfer is otherwise called for in the facts and circumstances of a given case. it was argued with considerable forensic tenacity that access to justice being a fundamental right guaranteed under $$$ of the constitution of india any litigant whose fundamental right to access to justice is denied or jeopardised can approach this $$$ for redress under $$$ of the constitution of india for protection and enforcement of his / her right. this $$$ can in any such case issue appropriate directions to protect such right which protection may in appropriate cases include a direction for transfer of the case from that state to the $$$ outside the state or vice versa. it was strenuously argued that $$$ of the constitution of india read with $$$ amply empower this $$$ to intervene and issue suitable directions wherever such directions were considered necessary to do complete justice to the parties including justice in the matter of ensuring that litigants engaged in legal proceedings in any $$$ within or outside the state of jammu and kashmir get a fair and reasonable opportunity to access justice by transfer of their cases to or from that state if necessary. distinct questions fall for consideration in the context of what is argued at the bar. the involves examination of whether access to justice is indeed a fundamental right and if so what is the sweep and content of that right while the is whether $$$ and of the constitution of india empower this $$$ to issue suitable directions for transfer of cases to and from the state of jammu & kashmir in appropriate situations. both these aspects in our view are well -traversed by judicial pronouncements of this $$$ as well as those of $$$s in england in which the $$$s have had an opportunity to examine the jurisprudential aspect of the right of access to justice and its correlation with the right to life. availability of $$$ of the constitution of india for directing transfer of cases in situations where such power is not stricto sensu available under an ordinary statute or the constitution has also been judicially explored by this $$$ on several earlier occasions. we may deal with the said aspects ad seriatim. the concept of access to justice as an invaluable human right also recognized in most constitutional democracies as a fundamental right has its origin in common law as much as in the magna carta. the magna carta lays the foundation for the basic right of access to courts in the following words no freeman shall be taken or imprisd or disseised or outlawed or exiled or in any way ruined nor will we go or send against him except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.to no man will we sell to no will we deny or delay right to justice.moreover all those aforesaid customs and liberties the observance of which we have granted in our kingdom as far as pertains to us towards our men shall be observed by all our kingdom as well clergy as laymen as far as pertains to them towards their men.wherefore it is our will and we firmly enjoin that the english church be free and the men in our kingdom have an hold all the aforesaid liberties rights and concessions well as peaceably freely and quietly fully and wholly for themselves and their heirs of us and our heirs in all aspects and in all places for ever as is aforesaid. an oath moreover has been taken as well on our part as on the part of the barons that all these conditions aforesaid shall be kept in good faith and without evil intention -given under our hand -the above named and many others being witnesses -in the meadow which is called $$$ between windsor and staines on $$$$ in $$$$ of our reign. the universal declaration of rights drafted in the year gave recognition to rights pertaining to access to justice in the following words $$$ every has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.$$$ every is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him. to the same effect is clause of $$$ of international covenant on civil and political rights which provides that each state party to the covenant shall undertake that every person whose rights or freedom as recognised is violated shall have an effective remedy and to ensure that any person claiming such a remedy shall have his right thereto determined by competent judicial administrative or legislative authorities and the state should also ensure to develop the possibilities of judicial remedies. de smith 's book on judicial review of administrative action th $$$.stated the principle thus it is a common law presumption of legislative intent that access of queen 's $$$ in respect of justiciable issues is not to be denied save by clear words in a statute. prof. m. $$$ rabel a noted jurist in his book access to justice volume i explained the importance of access to justice in the following words the right of effective access to justice has emerged with the new social rights. indeed it is of paramount importance among these new rights since clearly the enjoyment of traditional as well as new social rights presupposes mechanisms for their effective protection. such protection moreover is best assured by a workable remedy within the framework of the judicial system. effective access to justice can thus be seen as the most basic requirement -the most basic human right -of a system which purports to guarantee legal right. $$$s in england have over $$$$ post magna carta developed fundamental principles of common law which are enshrined as the basic rights of all humans. these principles were over a period of time recognised in the form of bill of rights and $$$ of various countries which acknowledged the $$$ maxim ubi jus ibi remedium i. every right when it is breached must be provided with a right to a remedy. judicial pronouncements have delved and elaborated on the concept of access to justice to include among other aspects the state 's obligation to make available to all its citizens the means for a just and peaceful settlement of disputes between them as to their respective legal rights. in r. v. secretary of state for home dept.p leech $$$ / ukwa/00/$$$$ all er steyn lj was dealing with a prisr who complained that correspondence with his solicitor concerning litigation in which he was involved or which he intended to launch was being censored by the prison authorities under the prisons rules. he challenged the authority of the secretary of state to create an impediment in the free flow of communication between him and his solicitor about contemplated legal proceedings. the court held that access to justice was a basic right which could not be denied or diluted by any kind of interference or hindrance. the court said it is a principle of our law that every citizen has a right of unimpeded access to a court. in raymond v. $$$ / ukhl/000/$$$$ ac $$$ / ukhl/000/$$$$ alt er. lord $$$ described it as a basic right. even in our unwritten constitution it ranks as a constitutional right. in raymond v. $$$ lord $$$ said that there was nothing in the prisons act that confers power to interfere with this right or to hinder its exercise. lord $$$ said that rules which did not comply with this principle would be ultra vires. lord $$$ lord $$$ of $$$ agreed.. it is true that lord $$$ held that the rules properly construed were not ultra vires. but that does not affect the importance of the observations. lord bridge held that rules in question in that case were ultra vires.. he went further than lord $$$ and said that a citizen 's right to unimpeded access can only be taken away by express enactment.. it seems to us that lord $$$ 's observation ranks as the ratio decidendi of the case and we accept that such rights can as a matter of legal principle be taken away by necessary implication. the legal position is no different in india. access to justice has been recognised as a valuable right by courts in this country long before the commencement of the constitution. reference in this regard may be made to re $$$ $$$ / mh/00/$$$$$$$ / mh/00/$$$$ air bom in which $$$ was arrested in aden and brought to bombay on the charge of criminal breach of trust. $$$ 's legal adviser was denied access to meet the prisr. the magistrate who ordered the remand held that he had no jurisdiction to grant access notwithstanding section the prisons act. the question that therefore fell for consideration was whether the right extended to the stage where the prisr was in police custody. the high $$$ of bombay while referring to section of the $$$ of criminal procedure held that the right under that provision implied that the prisr should have a reasonable opportunity if in custody of getting into communication with his legal adviser for the purposes of preparing his defence. $$$ j.comprising the bench added that..if the ends of justice is justice and the spirit of justice is fairness then each side should have equal opportunity to prepare its own case and to lay its evidence fully freely and fairly before the $$$. this necessarily involves preparation. such preparation is far more effective from the point of view of justice if it is made with the aid of skilled legal advice -advice so valuable that in the gravest of criminal trials when life or death hangs in the balance the very state which undertakes the prosecution of the prisr also provides him if poor with such legal assistance. reference may also be made to p.k. tare v. emperor $$$ / na/00/$$$$$$$ / na/00/$$$$ air nagpur. that was a case where the $$$ had participated in the quit india movement of. the detention was challenged on the ground of being vitiated on account of refusal of permission by the authorities to allow them to meet their counsel to seek legal advice or approach the court in person. the state opposed that plea based on defence of india act which according to it took away right of the detenu to move a habeas corpus petition under section of the $$$ of criminal procedure. $$$ the contention and relying upon the observation of lord $$$ in $$$ v. $$$. of nigeria the court held that such fundamental rights safeguarded under the constitution with elaborate and anxious care and upheld time and again by the highest tribunals of the realm in language of utmost vigour can not be swept away by implication or removed by some sweeping generality. justice $$$ giving the leading opinion of the court explained that the right to move the high $$$ remained intact notwithstanding the defence of india act. he further held that although courts allow a great deal of latitude to the executive and presumptions in favour of the liberty of the subject are weakened those rights do not disappear altogether. the $$$ ruled that the attempt to keep the applicants away from the $$$ under the guise of these rules was an abuse of the power and warranted intervention. justice bose emphasized the importance of the right of any person to apply to the court and demand that he be dealt with according to law. he said..the right is prized in india no less highly than in england or indeed any other part of the empire perhaps even more highly here than elsewhere and it is zealously guarded by the courts. decisions of this $$$ too have unequivocally recognised the right of a citizen to move the court as a valuable constitutional right recognised by $$$ of the constitution as fundamental right by itself. see in re under $$$ constitution of india keshav singh case air sc and l. $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc. in $$$ v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ scc this $$$ declared speedy trial as an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in $$$. it also pointed out that $$$ made free legal service an inalienable element of reasonable fair and just procedure and that the right to such services was implicit in the guarantee of $$$. in imtiyaz ahmad v. state of uttar pradesh and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc a -judge bench of this $$$ to which of us thakur j.was also a party this $$$ examined the correctness of an interlocutory order passed by a learned single judge of the high $$$ of allahabad whereby the single judge had stayed the order passed by the additional chief judicial magistrate directing registration of a case against the respondents. since the matter had remained pending before the high $$$ and was not heard for a long time of over years or so and since several other cases in different high $$$s in india were similarly pending in which the proceedings before the trial $$$ had been stayed no matter the cases involved commission of heinous offences like murder rape kidnapping and dacoity etc.this $$$ enlarged the scope of the proceedings and directed the registrar generals of the high $$$s to furnish a report containing statistics of cases pending in the respective $$$s in which the proceedings had been stayed at the stage of registration of fir and framing of charges in exercise of powers under $$$ of the constitution or section or of the $$$ of criminal procedure. on the basis of the statistics so furnished by the high $$$s this $$$ held that administration of justice was facing problems of serious dimensions. this $$$ also noticed on the basis of the material made available by the high $$$s that unduly long delay was being caused in the disposal of the cases resulting in a blatant violation of the rule of law and the right of common man to seek access to justice. emphasizing the importance of access to justice and recognizing the right as a fundamental right relatable to $$$ of the constitution of india this $$$ observed..... unduly long delay has the effect of bringing about blatant violation of the rule of law and adverse impact on the common man 's access to justice. a person 's access to justice is a guaranteed fundamental right under the constitution and particularly $$$. denial of the right undermines public confidence in the justice delivery system and incentivises people to look for shot cuts and other fora where they feel that injustice will be d quicker. in the long run this also weakens the justice delivery system and poses a threat to the rule of law. it may not be out of place to highlight that access to justice in an egalitarian democracy must be understood to mean qualitative access to justice as well. access to justice is therefore much more than improving an individual 's access to courts or guaranteeing representation. it must be defined in terms of ensuring that legal and judicial outcomes are just and inequitable see united nations development programme access to justice -practice note . the present case discloses the need to reiterate that access to justice is vital for the rule of law which by implication includes the right of access to an independent judiciary. it is submitted that the stay of investigation or trial for significant periods of time runs counter to the principle of rule of law wherein the rights and aspirations of citizens are intertwined with expeditious conclusion of matters. it is further submitted that delay in conclusion of criminal matters signifies a restriction on the right of access to justice itself thus amounting to a violation of citizen 's rights under the constitution in particular under $$$. the $$$ held that rule of law independence of judiciary and access to justice are conceptually interwoven. the $$$ also referred to the international covenant on civil and political rights and the statute of the international criminal $$$. it also referred to $$$ of the charter of fundamental rights of european union and european convention on human rights and fundamental freedom. reliance was placed upon the european $$$ of human rights decision in delcourt v. belgium echr to hold that access to justice was a valuable human and fundamental right relatable to $$$ of the constitution of india. having said that this $$$ issued directions for better maintenance of the rule of law and better administration of justice by the high $$$s. it also directed the law commission of india to undertake a study and submit its recommendations in relation to measures that need to be taken by creation of additional courts and other allied matters including rational and scientific methods for elimination of arrears to help reduce delay and speedy clearance of the backlog of cases. in brij $$$ v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc this $$$ declared that $$$ guarantees to the citizens the rights to expeditious and fair trial. the $$$ observed:. $$$ of the constitution of india takes in its sweep the right to expeditious and fair trial. even $$$ of the constitution recognises the right of citizens to equal justice and free legal aid. to put it simply it is the constitutional duty of the government to provide the citizens of the country with such judicial infrastructure and means of access to justice so that every person is able to receive an expeditious inexpensive and fair trial. the plea of financial limitations or constraints can hardly be justified as a valid excuse to avoid performance of the constitutional duty of the government more particularly when such rights are accepted as basic and fundamental to the human rights of citizens. in tamilnad mercantile bank shareholders welfare association v. s.c. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc//00$$$ / sc//00 scc this $$$ declared that an aggrieved person can not be left without the remedy and that access to justice is a human right and in certain situations even a fundamental right. in order that the juristic content and basis of access to justice as a fundamental right is not provided only by judicial pronouncements the commission for review of the constitution has recommended that access to justice be incorporated as an express fundamental rights as in the south african constitution. $$$ of the south african constitution reads $$$ access to $$$s and tribunals and speedy justice.every has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before a $$$ or tribunal or forum or where appropriate another independent and impartial $$$ tribunal or forum.the right to access to $$$s shall be deemed to include right to reasonably speedy and effective justice in all matters before the $$$s tribunals or other forum and the state shall take all reasonable steps to achieve that object. insertion of $$$ in the constitution in the following terms was accordingly proposed by the commission:0a access to $$$s and tribunals and speedy justice.every has a right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before an independent court or where appropriate another independent and impartial tribunal or forum.the right to access to $$$s shall be deemed to include the right to reasonably speedy and effective justice in all matters before the courts tribunals or other fora and the state shall take all reasonable steps to achieve the said object. the recommendation has not yet led to the incorporation of the proposed $$$ but that does not in the least matter for what the proposed $$$ may have added to the constitutional guarantees already stands acknowledged as a part of the right to life under $$$ of the constitution by judicial pronouncements of this $$$. the proposed incorporation of $$$ would have simply formalised what already stands recognised by judges and jurists alike. v. $$$. has in his inimitable style explained the importance of access to justice in the following words access to justice is basic to human rights and directive principles of state policy become ropes of sand teasing illusion and promise of unreality unless there is effective means for the common people to reach the $$$ seek remedy and enjoy the fruits of law and justice. to sum up access to justice is and has been recognised as a part and parcel of right to life in india and in all civilized societies around the globe. the right is so basic and inalienable that no system of governance can possibly ignore its significance leave al afford to deny the same to its citizens. the magna carta the universal declaration of rights the international covenant on civil and political rights the ancient roman jurisprudential maxim of ubi jus ibi remedium the development of fundamental principles of common law by judicial pronouncements of the $$$s over $$$$ past have all contributed to the acceptance of access to justice as a basic and inalienable human right which all civilized societies and systems recognise and enforce. this $$$ has by a long line of decisions given an expansive meaning and interpretation to the word life appearing in $$$ of the constitution. in $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc this $$$ declared that the right to life does not mean mere animal existence al but includes every aspect that makes life meaningful and liveable to be checked. in sunil batra v. delhi administration $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc the right against solitary confinement and prison torture and custodial death was declared to be a part of right to life. in $$$ v. suptd. $$$ / $$$ / sc/000/$$$$ scc the right against bar fetters was declared to be a right protected under $$$ of the constitution. in khatri ii v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc the right to free legal aid was held to be a right covered under $$$ of the constitution. in prem shankar shukla v. delhi administration $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc the right against handcuffing was declared to be a right under $$$. so also in $$$ v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc the right to compensation for illegal and unlawful detention was considered to be a right to life under $$$ and also under $$$. in sheela barse v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc this $$$ declared speedy trial to be an essential right under $$$. in parmanand katara v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc right to emergency medical aid was declared to be protected under $$$ of the constitution. in chameli singh v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/06/$$$$$$$ / sc/06/$$$$ scc and $$$ v. $$$ totame $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc right to shelter clothing decent environment and a decent accommodation was also held to be a part of life. in m.c. $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc right to clean environment was held to be a right to life under $$$. in lata singh v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/260/$$$$$$$ / sc/260/$$$$ scc right to marriage was held to be a part of

sukhwant singh v. state of punjab manu / sc/066/$$$$manu / sc/066/$$$$ scc right to reputation was declared to be a facet of right to life guaranteed under $$$. in the recent constitution bench judgment decision of this $$$ in subramanian swamy v. union of india w.p. crl.no. of this $$$ held reputation to be an inherent and inseparable compnt of $$$. given the fact that pronouncements mentid above have interpreted and understood the word life appearing in $$$ of the constitution on a broad spectrum of rights considered incidental and/or integral to the right to life there is no real reason why access to justice should be considered to be falling outside the class and category of the said rights which already stands recognised as being a part and parcel of the $$$ of the constitution of india.if life implies not only life in the physical sense but a bundle of rights that makes life worth living there is no juristic or other basis for holding that denial of access to justice will not affect the quality of human life so as to take access to justice out of the purview of right to life guaranteed under $$$. we have therefore no hesitation in holding that access to justice is indeed a facet of right to life guaranteed under $$$ of the constitution. we need only add that access to justice may as well be the facet of the right guaranteed under $$$ of the constitution which guarantees equality before law and equal protection of laws to not only citizens but non -citizens also. we say so because equality before law and equal protection of laws is not limited in its application to the realm of executive action that enforces the law. it is as much available in relation to proceedings before $$$s and tribunal and adjudicatory fora where law is applied and justice administered. the citizen 's inability to access courts or any other adjudicatory mechanism provided for determination of rights and obligations is bound to result in denial of the guarantee contained in $$$ both in relation to equality before law as well as equal protection of laws. $$$ of any adjudicatory mechanism or the inadequacy of such mechanism needless to say is bound to prevent those looking for enforcement of their right to equality before laws and equal protection of the laws from seeking redress and thereby negate the guarantee of equality before laws or equal protection of laws and reduce it to a mere teasing illusion. $$$ of the constitution apart access to justice can be said to be part of the guarantee contained in $$$ as well. what then is the sweep and content of that right is the next question that must be answered for a fuller understanding of the principle and its significance in real life situations. main facets that in our opinion constitute the essence of access to justice are the state must provide an effective adjudicatory mechanism;ii the mechanism so provided must be reasonably accessible in terms of distance;iii the process of adjudication must be speedy andiv the litigant 's access to the adjudicatory process must be affordable.the need for adjudicatory mechanism of the most fundamental requirements for providing to the citizens access to justice is to set -up an adjudicatory mechanism whether described as a $$$ tribunal commission or authority or called by any other name whatsoever where a citizen can agitate his grievance and seek adjudication of what he may perceive as a breach of his right by another citizen or by the state or any of its instrumentalities. in order that the right of a citizen to access justice is protected the mechanism so provided must not only be effective but must also be just fair and objective in its approach. so also the procedure which the court tribunal or authority may adopt for adjudication must in itself be just and fair and in keeping with the well recognized principles of natural justice.the mechanism must be conveniently accessible in terms of distance the forum / mechanism so provided must having regard to the hierarchy of courts / tribunals be reasonably accessible in terms of distance for access to justice since so much depends upon the ability of the litigant to place his / her grievance effectively before the court / tribunal / court / competent authority to grant such a relief. see d.k. basu v. state of west bengal scc.the process of adjudication must be speedy.access to justice as a constitutional value will be a mere illusion if justice is not speedy. justice delayed it is famously said is justice denied. if the process of administration of justice is so time consuming laborious indolent and frustrating for those who seek justice that it dissuades or deters them from even considering resort to that process as an option it would tantamount to denial of not only access to justice but justice itself. in sheela barse 's case supra this $$$ declared speedy trial as a facet of right to life for if the trial of a citizen goes on endlessly his right to life itself is violated. there is jurisprudentially no qualitative difference between denial of speedy trial in a criminal case on the hand and civil suit appeal or other proceedings on the other for ought we know that civil disputes can at times have an equally if not more severe impact on a citizen 's life or the quality of it. access to justice would therefore be a constitutional value of any significance and utility only if the delivery of justice to the citizen is speedy for otherwise the right to access to justice is no more than a hollow slogan of no use or inspiration for the citizen. it is heartening to note that over the past decades or so the number of courts established in the country has increased manifold in comparison to the number that existed on $$$$ the country earned its freedom. there is $$$$ almost invariably a court of civil judge junior or senior division in every taluka and a district and sessions judge in every district. in terms of accessibility from the point of view of distance which a citizen ought to travel we have come a long way since the time the british left the country. however the increase in literacy awareness prosperity and proliferation of laws has made the process of adjudication slow and time consuming primarily on account of the over worked and under staffed judicial system which is crying for creation of additional courts with requisite human resources and infrastructure to effectively deal with an ever increasing number of cases being filed in the courts and mounting backlog of over cases in the subordinate courts. while the states have d their bit in terms of providing the basic adjudicatory mechanisms for disposal of resolution of civil or criminal conflicts access to justice remains a big question mark on account of delays in the completion of the process of adjudication on account of poor judge population and judge case ratio in comparison to other countries.the process of adjudication must be affordable to the disputants access to justice will again be no more than an illusion if the adjudicatory mechanism provided is so expensive as to deter a disputant from taking resort to the same. $$$ of the constitution promotes a laudable objective of providing legal aid to needy litigants and obliges the state to make access to justice affordable for the less fortunate sections of the society. legal aid to the needy has been recognized as of the facets of access to justice in madhav $$$ v. state of maharashtra manu / sc/0119/$$$$manu / sc/0119/$$$$ scc where this $$$ observed if a prisr sentenced to imprisonment is virtually unable to exercise his constitutional and statutory right of appeal inclusive of special leave to appeal for want of legal assistance there is implicit in the $$$ under $$$ read with $$$s and of the constitution power to assign counsel for such imprisd individual for doing complete justice. this is a necessary incident of the right of appeal conferred by the $$$ and allowed by $$$ of the constitution. the inference is inevitable that this is a state 's duty and not government 's charity. equally affirmative is the implication that while legal services must be free to the beneficiary the lawyer himself has to be reasonably remunerated for his services. surely the profession has a public commitment to the people but mere philanthropy of its members yields short mileage in the long run. their services especially when they are on behalf of the state must be paid for. naturally the state concerned must pay a reasonable sum that the court may fix when assigning counsel to the prisr. of course the court may judge the situation and consider from all angles whether it is necessary for the ends of justice to make available legal aid in the particular case. in every country where free legal services are given it is not d in all cases but only where public justice suffers otherwise. that discretion resides in the court. affordability of access to justice has been to an extent taken care of by the state sponsored legal aid programmes under the legal service authorities act. legal aid programmes have been providing the much needed support to the poorer sections of the society in the accessing justice in $$$s. that brings us to the facet of the question referred to us namely whether $$$ of the constitution of india read with $$$ empowers the supreme $$$ to direct transfer in a situation where neither the central code of civil procedure or the central code of criminal procedure empowers such transfer to / from the state of jammu and kashmir. the need for transfer of cases from court to the other often arises in several situations which are suitably addressed by the courts competent to direct transfers in exercise of powers available to them under the code of civil procedure cpc or the code of criminal procedure cr.p.c. convenience of parties and witnesses often figures as the main reason for the courts to direct such transfers. what is significant is that while in the rest of the country the courts deal with applications for transfer of civil / criminal cases under the provisions of the code of civil procedure and the code of criminal procedure the fact that there is no such enabling provision for transfer from or to the state of jammu and kashmir does not detract from the power of a superior court to direct such transfer if it is of the opinion that such a direction is essential to subserve the interest of justice. in other words even if the provision empowering courts to direct transfer from court to other were to stand deleted from the statute the superior courts would still be competent to direct such transfer in appropriate cases so long as such courts are satisfied that denial of such a transfer would result in violation of the right to access to justice to a litigant in a given fact situation. now if access to justice is a facet of the right to life guaranteed under $$$ of the constitution a violation actual or threatened of that right would justify the invocation of this $$$ 's powers under $$$ of the constitution. exercise of the power vested in the court under that $$$ could take the form of a direction for transfer of a case from court to the other to meet situations where the statutory provisions do not provide for such transfers. any such exercise would be legitimate as it would prevent the violation of the fundamental right of the citizens guaranteed under $$$ of the constitution. that apart from $$$ even $$$ of the constitution can be invoked to direct transfer of a case from court to the other is also settled by a constitution bench decision of this $$$ in union carbide corporation v. union of india manu / sc/0058/1992manu / sc/0058/1992 scc. of the questions that fell for consideration in that case was whether this $$$ could in exercise of its powers under $$$s and withdraw a case pending in the lower court and dispose of the same finally even when $$$ does not empower the court to do so. answering the question in the affirmative this $$$ held that the power to transfer cases is not exhausted under $$$ of the constitution. this $$$ observed that $$$ enables the litigant to seek transfer of proceedings if the conditions in the $$$ are satisfied. the said $$$ was not intended to nor does it operate to affect the wide powers available to this $$$ under $$$s and of the constitution. the following passages from the judgments are apposite in this regard:61. to the extent power of withdrawal and transfer of cases to the apex $$$ is in the opinion of the $$$ necessary for the purpose of effectuating the high purpose of $$$ and the power under article must be held not to exhaust the power of withdrawal and transfer. article it is relevant to mention here was introduced as part of the scheme of the constitution -second amendment. that amendment proposed to invest the supreme $$$ with exclusive jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of central laws by inserting $$$  and. but $$$ and were omitted by the -third amendment act leaving article intact. that article enables the litigants to approach the apex $$$ for transfer of proceedings if the conditions envisaged in that article are satisfied. article was not intended nor does it operate to whittle down the existing wide powers under articles and of the constitution. dealing with the question whether a provision contained in an ordinary statute would affect the exercise of powers under article of the constitution this $$$ held that the constitutional power under article was at a different level altogether and that an ordinary statute could not control the exercise of that power. speaking for the majority venkatachaliah j.as his lordship then was observed the power under article is at an entirely different level and of a different quality. prohibitions or limitations or provisions contained in ordinary laws can not ipso facto act as prohibitions or limitations on the constitutional powers under article. such prohibitions or limitations in the statutes might embody and reflect the scheme of a particular law taking into account the nature and status of the authority or the court on which conferment or power -limited in some appropriate way -is contemplated. the limitations may not necessarily reflect or be based on any fundamental considerations of public policy...but we think that such prohibition should also be shown to be based on some underlying fundamental and general issues of public policy and not merely incidental to a particular statutory scheme or pattern. it will again be wholly incorrect to say that powers under article are subject to such express statutory prohibitions. that would convey the idea that statutory provisions override a constitutional provision. perhaps the proper way of expressing the idea is that in exercising powers under article and in assessing the needs of complete justice of a cause or matter the apex $$$ will take note of the express prohibitions in any substantive provision based on some fundamental principles of public policy and regulate the exercise of its power and discretion accordingly. the proposition does not relate to the powers of the court under article but only to what is or is not complete justice of a cause or matter and in the ultimate analysis of the propriety of the exercise of the power. no question of lack of jurisdiction or of nullity can arise. in the cases at hand there is no prohibition against use of power under article to direct transfer of cases from a court in the state of jammu and kashmir to a court outside the state or vice versa. all that can be said is that there is no enabling provision because of the reasons which we have indicated earlier. the absence of an enabling provision however can not be construed as a prohibition against transfer of cases to or from the state of jammu and kashmir. at any rate a prohibition simplicitor is not enough. what is equally important is to see whether there is any fundamental principle of public policy underlying any such prohibition. no such prohibition nor any public policy can be seen in the cases at hand much less a public policy based on any fundamental principle. the extraordinary power available to this court under article of the constitution can therefore be usefully invoked in a situation where the court is satisfied that denial of an order of transfer from or to the court in the state of jammu and kashmir will deny the citizen his / her right of access to justice. the provisions of articles and are therefore wide enough to empower this court to direct such transfer in appropriate situations no matter central code of civil and criminal procedures do not extend to the state nor do the state codes of civil and criminal procedure contain any provision that empowers this court to transfer cases. we accordingly answer the question referred to us in the affirmative. the transfer petitions shall now be listed before the regular bench for hearing and disposal on merits keeping in view what has been observed above.
