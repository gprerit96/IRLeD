perusal of the terms of the bank guarantee reveals that the same was an unconditional guarantee and that the guarantor expressly waived off rights of any objection and defence irrespective of the disputed positions adopted by the contracting parties or even the validity and legal effects of the contractual agreement. under the bank guarantees the $$$ -m / s. aafl would make a demand / claim for the payment in lieu of fruits transported to respondent no. and in case respondent no. failed to reimburse the consideration the $$$ had the right to make a demand from the guarantor for the above payment. actually the above stated claim of consideration from m / s. rmsfc in the instance was also unnecessary in view of paragraph of the bank guarantee extracted above which clearly provides that it would not be necessary for m / s. aafl for demanding the consideration from the wholesaler -m / s. rmsfc before presenting the demand to the guarantor -state bank of mysore. the aforesaid demand in terms of the bank guarantee was to be made on the basis of a demand / claim at the hands of m / s. aafl indicating the despatch of goods and the amount payable in lieu thereof. thereupon,- the guarantor was to make the payment of the amount claimed immediately without any demur and without any recourse. on the receipt of such a certificate of the outstanding amount(s the bank guarantee(s

upon the aforesaid demand being not honoured by respondent no. the bank guarantee was sought to be invoked through the aforesaid outstanding certificate dated.which is being extracted hereunder

karnataka where the $$$ preferred w.p. no. of did not interfere with the interim order. the order passed by the high court on.dismissing the above -mentid writ petition is subject matter of challenge at the hands of the $$$ before this court. as a proposition of law learned counsel for the $$$ has placed vehement reliance on a number of judgments of this court we would refer to only of them which would suffice the purpose. in this behalf reference may be made to u.p. $$$erative federation ltd. v. singh consultants and engineers p ltd. $$$ / sc/00/97$$$ / sc/00/97 scc where -from our attention was invited to the following observations:. our attention was also drawn to the judgment of the learned single judge of the madras high court in $$$ v. rashtriya chemicals and fertilizers ltd. bombay and anr. $$$ / tn/07/$$$$$$$ / tn/07/$$$$ a.i.r. madras where the learned single judge expressed the opinion that there was no absolute rule prohibiting grant of interim injunction relating to bank guarantees and in exceptional case courts would interfere with the machinery of irrevocable obligations assumed by banks and that the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case meaning thereby that there is a bona fide contention between the parties or serious question to be tried and further the balance of convenience was also a relevant factor. if the element of fraud exists then courts step in to prevent of the parties to the contract from deriving unjust enrichment by invoking bank guarantee. in that case the learned single judge came to the conclusion that the suit involved serious questions to be tried and particularly relating to the plea of fraud which was a significant factor to be taken into account and claim for interdicting the enforcement of bank guarantee should have been allowed. i am however of the opinion that these observations must be strictly considered in the light of the principle enunciated. it is not the decision that there should be a prima facie case. in order to restrain the operation either of irrevocable letter of credit or of confirmed letter of credit or of bank guarantee there should be serious dispute and there should be good prima facie case of fraud and special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties. otherwise the very purpose of bank guarantees would be negatived and the fabric of trading operation will get jeopardised.$$$. the argument for the respondent is attractive but it seems to overlook the basic nature of the case. the basic nature of the case relates to the obligations assumed by the bank under the guarantees given to upcof ltd. if under law the bank can not be prevented by sce p ltd. from honouring the credit guarantees the upcof ltd. also can not be restrained from invoking the guarantees. what applies to the bank must equally apply to upcof ltd. therefore the frame of the suit by not impleading the bank can not make any difference in the position of law. equally it would he futile to contend that the court was justified in granting the injunction since it has found a prima facie case in favour of the sce(p ltd. the question of examining the prima facie case or balance of convenience does not arise if the court can not interfere with the unconditional commitment made by the bank in the guarantees in question.xxx xxx xxx54. the court however should not lightly interfere with the operation of irrevocable documentary credit. i agree with my learned brother that in order to restrain the operation of the irrevocable letter of credit performance bond or guarantee there should be serious dispute to be tried and there should be a good prima facie acts of fraud. as sir $$$.r. said in bolivinter oil sa v. chase manhattan bank and ors. all e.r. at wholly exceptional case where an injunction may be granted is where it is proved that the bank knows that any demand for payment already made or which may thereafter be made will clearly be fraudulent. but the evidence must be clear both as to the fact of fraud and as to the bank 's knowledge. it would certainly not normally be sufficient that this rests on the uncorroborated statement of the customer for irreparable damage can be d to a bank 's credit in the relatively brief time which must elapse between the granting of such an injunction and an application by the bank to have it discharged. from the above discussion what appears to me is this the sound banking system may however require more caution in the issuance of irrevocable documentary credits. it would be for the banks to safeguard themselves by other means and generally not for the court to come to their rescue with injunctions unless there is established fraud. in the result this appeal must be allowed. the judgment and order of the allahabad high court dated february must be set aside and the order of learned civil judge lucknow dated august restored.emphasis is $$$$. reliance was also placed on vinitec electronics private ltd. v. hcl infosystems ltd. $$$ / sc/095/007$$$ / sc/095/007 scc. the following observations have been recorded in the above judgment:. the law relating to invocation of bank guarantees is by now well settled by a catena of decisions of this court. the bank guarantees which provided that they are payable by the guarantor on demand is considered to be an un -conditional bank guarantee. when in the course of commercial dealings unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. in u.p. state sugar corporation v. sumac international ltd.this court observed that:. the law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by now well settled. when in the course of commercial dealings an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. the bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. the very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. the courts should therefore be slow in granting an injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee. the courts have carved out only exceptions. a fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee. hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage he can be restrained from doing so. the exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to of the parties concerned. since in most cases payment of my under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is given the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an injunction on commercial dealings in the country. the grounds are not necessarily connected though both may coexist in some cases. it is equally well settled in law that bank guarantee is an independent contract between bank and the beneficiary thereof. the bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as long as it is an unconditional and irrevocable. the dispute between the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and of no consequence. in bses limited v. fenner india ltd. this court held:0. there are however exceptions to this rule. the is when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks to benefit. the fraud must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction. the exception to the general rule of non -intervention is when there are special equities in favour of injunction such as when irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice would occur if such an injunction were not granted. the general rule and its exceptions has been reiterated in so many judgments of this court that in u.p. state sugar corporation v. sumac international ltd. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc hereinafter u.p. state sugar corpn this court correctly declare that the law was settled. in himadri chemicals industries ltd. v. coal tar refining co.this court summarized the principles for grant of refusal to grant of injunction to restrain the enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in the following ..while dealing with an application for injunction in the course of commercial dealings and when an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of credit is given or accepted the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the contract.the bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer.the courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain the realization of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an independent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature the existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit.fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation.vi allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to of the parties concerned. in $$$ sakkare karkhane v. national heavy engg. $$$. ltd. and anr.this court observed if the bank guarantee furnished is an unconditional and irrevocable it is not open to the bank to raise any objection whatsoever to pay the amounts under the guarantee. the person in whose favour the guarantee is furnished by the bank can not be prevented by way of an injunction from enforcing the guarantee on the pretext that the condition for enforcing the bank guarantee in terms of the agreement entered into between the parties has not been fulfilled. such a course is impermissible. the seller can not raise the dispute of whatsoever nature and prevent the purchaser from enforcing the bank guarantee by way of injunction except on the ground of fraud and irretrievable injury.what is relevant are the terms incorporated in the guarantee executed by the bank. on careful analysis of the terms and conditions of the guarantee in the present case it is found that the guarantee is an unconditional. the respondent therefore can not be allowed to raise any dispute and prevent the $$$ from encashing the bank guarantee. the mere fact that the bank guarantee refers to the principle agreement without referring to any specific clause in the preamble of the deed of guarantee does not make the guarantee furnished by the bank to be a conditional .xxx $$$. the next question that falls for our consideration is as to whether the present case falls under any of or both the exceptions namely whether there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks to benefit and another exception whether there are any special equities in favour of granting injunction. this court in more than decision took the view that fraud if any must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate the underlying transaction. we have meticulously examined the pleadings in the present case in which no factual foundation is laid in support of the allegation of fraud. there is not even a proper allegation of any fraud as such and in fact the whole case of the $$$ centers around the allegation with regard to the alleged breach of contract by the respondent. the plea of fraud in the $$$s own words is to the following effect that despite the respondent hcl being in default of not making payment as stipulated in the bank guarantee in perpetration of abject dishsty and fraud the respondent hcl fraudulently invoked the bank guarantee furnished by the applicant and sought remittance of the sums under the conditional bank guarantee from the oriental bank of commerce vide letter of invocation dated.. in our considered opinion such vague and indefinite allegations made do not satisfy the requirement in law constituting any fraud much less the fraud of an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire transaction. the case therefore does not fall within the exception. whether encashment of the bank guarantee would cause any irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice. there is no plea of any special equities by the $$$ in its favour. so far as the plea of irretrievable injustice is concerned the $$$ in its petition merely stated that should the respondent be successful in implementing its evil design the same would not only amount to fraud cause irretrievable injustice to the applicant and render the arbitration nugatory and infructuous but would permit the respondent to take an unfair advantage of their own wrong at the cost and extreme prejudice of the applicant.emphasis is ours)9. based on the judgments rendered by this court more particularly the judgments referred to hereinabove it was the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the $$$ that the terms and conditions of a deed of guarantee could not be injuncted from being given effect to on the basis of the principle adopted in determining prima facie case balance of convenience and irreparable loss which are the usual parameters on the basis whereof injunctions are granted. insofar as the injunction of an unconditional bank guarantee is concerned it was submitted that the same could be granted only if the court was satisfied about the commission of a flagrant fraud at the hands of or the other contracting parties or alternatively if the court was satisfied that an irreparable injury or some irretrievable injustice would be caused to the concerned party. insofar as the present controversy is concerned the defence of respondent no. is entirely based on a communication dated.stated to have been addressed by the $$$ to respondent no. the aforesaid communication which constitutes the basis of the defence of respondent no. is extracted hereunder adaniagrifresh limited4th $$$$. mahaboob shariff m / s. r.m.s. fruits & company # anesarui street behind deveraja market mysore 0sub settlement of amountsir we inform you that our settlement talk held at mysore regarding destroyed and damage of loads of apples supplied to you firm agreed to receive value of total value. hence you are directed to send the amount in installments as agreed after we supplying apple load as earlier.sincerely yours sd/-authorised signatoryseal.in addition to the relying on the above communication dated.it was the vehement contention of the learned counsel representing respondent no. that respondent no. -m / s. rmsfc had tendered and enclosed photographs depicting rotten and damaged apples which were allegedly despatched by the $$$ to respondent no. it was the submission of the learned counsel for respondent no. that the veracity of the aforesaid photographs was not disputed by the $$$ before the trial court. it is not possible for us to determine the veracity or truthfulness of the defence raised by respondent no. the aforesaid shall emerge only on the culmination of the proceedings initiated by respondent no. before the civil court. at the present juncture we are only concerned with the injunction of the bank guarantees referred to hereinabove the invocation whereof was injuncted not only by the trial court but also by the appellate court and the same was thereafter maintained even by the high court. during the course of hearing learned counsel for the $$$ candidly submitted that the communication dated.relied upon by respondent no. in its defence is a fabricated and doctored document which was never executed by the $$$. the position adopted by the rival parties lead us to record the following conclusions. firstly that the concerned bank guarantees are clearly unconditional. this is apparent from the extracts thereof reproduced above. secondly the veracity and truthfulness of defence of respondent no. -m / s rmsfc based on the communication dated.can not be opined on at the present juncture and will have to await the final outcome of the civil suit filed by m / s. rmsfc at mysore. thirdly m / s. rmsfc has not levelled any allegations of the commission of a flagrant fraud by m / s. aafl for engineering the invocation of the bank guarantees executed by the state bank of mysore. $$$ no submissions have been advanced on behalf of m / s. rmsfc to establish that the invocation of the bank guarantees would lead to an irreparable injury or some irretrievable injustice. the instant eventuality is therefore ruled out. in deciding the present controversy we will therefore have to adopt the principles laid down by this court in u.p. cooperative federation ltd. v. singh consultants and engineers p ltd. supra and in vinitec electronics private ltd. v. hcl infosystems ltd. supra. having given our thoughtful consideration to the law laid down by this court in respect of grant / refusal of an injunction of an unconditional bank guarantee and keeping in mind the terms and conditions more particularly of the contractual conditions extracted and narrated above we are satisfied that the courts below were not justified in injuncting the invocation of the bank guarantees executed by the state bank of mysore at the instance of m / s. rmsfc. we accordingly hereby direct respondent nos. and -the state bank of mysore to honour the same forthwith. while accepting the claim raised by the $$$ as has been recorded by us in our conclusions hereinabove it is also imperative for us to record that we had required the learned counsel representing the $$$ to obtain instructions from the $$$ whether or not the $$$ was truthful in describing the communication dated.as fabricated and doctored. in case the $$$ had accepted it to be genuine we would have permitted the bank guarantees to be invoked for the reimbursement of of the total value of the goods in consonance with the communication dated.. having obtained instructions learned counsel for the $$$ states that the express and specific stance of the $$$ that the communication dated.extracted above is actually fabricated and doctored and was never sent or executed by the $$$ -m / s. aafl to respondent no. -m / s. rmsfc. in view of the position adopted by the $$$ on express instructions we consider it just and appropriate to further record that in case the statement made to this court on behalf of the $$$ is not found to be correct on the culmination of the proceedings initiated by respondent no. it shall be open to respondent no. -m / s. rmsfc to initiate civil and criminal proceedings against the $$$ as may be permissible in accordance with law. we are satisfied in granting liberty to respondent no. -m / s. rmsfc to suitably amend the plaint so as to mould the relief in order to claim whatsoever is due to respondent no. under the contractual obligations with the appellant in consonance with law. the appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
