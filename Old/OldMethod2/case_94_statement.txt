. the $$$ hereinafter referred to as the assessee carrying the business of inter alia importing and exporting shawls and scarves and also trading therein. the $$$ has been importing shawls and scarves from nepal. on this import the department has held him liable for payment of additional duty also known as countervailing duty imposed under section of the customs tariff act. in respect of the aforesaid shawls and scarves imported by it the $$$ resisted the additional duty on the ground that locally manufactured / produced goods of similar nature namely shawls and scarves are exempted from payment of excise duty on unbranded goods and when similar unbranded goods produced in india do not incur any liability of payment of excise duty there is no question of payment of additional duty under section of the customs tariff act. the authorities below have not accepted the submission of the $$$ following the judgment of this court in $$$ v. union of india $$$ / mh/0446/99$$$ / mh/0446/99 e.l.t. bom.which in turn had followed m / s. khandelwal material & engineering works and anr. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc e.l.t. s.c. the judgment of this court in m / s. khandelwal material and engineering works and anr. was referred to the constitution bench of this court in the case of hyderabad industries limited v. uoi manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc : e.l.t. s.c.and he aforesaid aspect the constitution bench has over -ruled the view taken in khandelwal 's on the aforesaid aspect. the relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:"6. counsel for the $$$s rely strongly on the objects and reasons ' of section of the tariff act in support of their contention that the said section is a charging section and imposes a countervailing duty. the statement of objects and reasons says clause provides for the levy of additional duty on an imported article to counterbalance the excise duty leviable on the like article made indigenously or on the indigenous raw materials components or ingredients which go into the making of the like indigenous article. this provision corresponds to section of the existing act and is necessary to safeguard the interests of the manufacturers in india.this statement lends prima facie support to the contention of the $$$s but in the absence of any ambiguity in the wording of section we can not treat the additional duty referred to therein as countervailing duty. nor indeed can we regard that provision as a charging section merely because the statement says that section provides for the levy. the statement of objects and reasons errs in being common to sub -section and of section. it is more apposite to sub -section though even there it may not be correct to say that it is a charging provision. sub -section confers power on the central government in public interest to levy on any imported article such additional duty as would counterbalance the excise duty leviable on any raw materials components and ingredients of the same nature as or similar to those used in the production or manufacture of such article whether on such article duty is leviable under sub -section or not. since we are not concerned directly with sub -section we will not pronounce upon its meaning and implications. in this view of the matter it is unnecessary to consider the various decisions cited at the bar on the nature and connotation of countervailing duty. we are unable to accept the argument of the $$$s that section of the tariff act is an independent charging section or that the additional duty which it speaks of is not a duty of customs but is a countervailing duty. even on first principle the matter is crystal clear. the purpose of additional duty also known as countervailing duty under section is to protect the domestic market from unhealthy competition. once there is no excise duty on such goods produced domestically question of levying the additional duty in the form of giving such a protection does not arise at all. we therefore do not agree with the view taken by the authorities below and hold that the $$$ is not liable to pay any additional duty under section of the act. the order of the cegat dated --is accordingly set aside. the $$$ shall be entitled to refund additional duty filed in accordance with law.in c.a. view of the order passed in c.a. no. as aforementioned mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the $$$ does not press this appeal and it is accordingly dismissed as not pressed.
