both phase i and phase ii of the scheme are given effect to. the petitir moved applications for issuing some directions which were disposed of on.and.. the grievance of the petitir is that though a series of meetings had been held and attempts had been made by the petitir the financial institutions and the government of bihar to implement the scheme in letter and spirit but the promoter ncfl was bent upon ousting the president of the petitir union from the monitoring committee which was set up and a settlement was ostensibly signed with the said union. the unit was lying closed and the entire work force was without wages except for about workers who were being paid some daily wages. $$$ chairman of ncfl had sent a letter to the state government on.requesting the government of india to take back possession of the unit and such conduct of his withdrawing from the scheme was in willful and deliberate defiance of the orders passed by this court. it is further averred that more than rs. crores of public my was disbursed with a view to ensure that the unit is revived but the same had not been d and ncfl wanted to get away after taking advantage of the aforesaid amount. in response to the notice $$$. $$$ joint secretary department of industrial policy & promotion ministry of commerce and industry government of india has filed a counter affidavit. the plea taken therein is that there has been no deliberate infraction of the orders passed by this court on his part or on the part of government of india. ashok paper mills was promoted in by $$$ of $$$ to manufacture mt per day of integrated pulp and wilting and printing paper from bagasse. the company went into liquidation in as it could not fraction properly. in the government of bihar and the government of assam took over the company as a joint venture with the active participation of idbi and under this venture units were established in assam and bihar. the company did well till but thereafter its performance slided downhill and ultimately production in both the units was suspended in. the equity participation by the government of assam in apm jogighopa assam is % and the equity participation of the government of bihar in apm rameshwarnagar $$$ is %. after several efforts to revive the units failed the company made a reference to the bifr. the state governments of assam and bihar agreed to bifurcate and nationalise their respective units and in consequence thereto the assam unit was nationalised in february. this court by its order dated.had directed the secretary industrial development to explore the possibility of the revival of the mill by privatisation consistent with the requirement to safeguard the rights and interests of the workmen through negotiations. it was accordingly decided that idbi would act as merchant banker for the purpose of privatisation of the unit. in response to an advertisement issued by idbi offers were received from firms. the negotiating committee constituted by the ministry of industry considered the proposals and finally recommended that the unit could be handed over to ncfl. accordingly the department of industrial policy & planning submitted a $$$ on.which was approved by this court on.. it is further stated in the affidavit that the revival scheme had stipulated that ncfl would pay a consideration of rs. crores and thereupon take over the unit without any liability and this amount was to be paid in quarterly installments of rs.lakhs each but it had paid only installments towards the consideration my. ncfl claimed to have invested rs. crores towards promoter 's contribution and according to their stand a tripartite agreement between workers ' union government of bihar and ncfl had been entered into. it was claimed by them that a bipartite agreement had been entered into with ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat which is also a recognized union. as many as meetings of the monitoring committee under the chairmanship of concerned joint secretary had taken place between.and.. idbi had already disbursed a term loan of rs. crores towards phase i of the revival scheme and as per the information furnished by ashok paper mills there had been a total investment of rs.crores which included the aforesaid loan given by idbi and rs.crores as share capital. shri umanath prasad singh did not participate in the meeting of the monitoring committee held on.and a decision was taken in the said meeting that in view of this court 's order dated.he had no locus standi to participate in the meetings of the monitoring committee as he had failed to comply with the directions of this court. $$$ he had not been invited in the subsequent meetings of the committee. vide order dated.passed by this court it was held that the agreement signed between ashok paper mills and ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat was a valid agreement for the purpose of implementation of the scheme. it is also stated that the department of industrial policy & promotion ministry of commerce and industry government of india in coordination with the department of banking was responsible for obtaining the sanction of additional term loan of rs. crores from idbi and a working capital of rs.crores from $$$ed bank of india. it is further pleaded that the department of industrial policy and promotion had been making serious efforts for the revival of the unit and as such there has been no disobedience or non -compliance of the orders passed by this court. $$$.s. $$$ secretary department of industries government of bihar has also filed a counter affidavit. it is stated therein that earlier the bihar unit of ashok paper mills never functid properly and it remained closed most of the time. under the rehabilitation scheme government of bihar government of assam lic and financial institutions were to transfer their shares to ncfl at % of the face value. the cost of the shares was to be paid by ncfl after months of taking over ownership of the factory. since there was a dispute on the date of take over and some shares of financial institutions and government of assam could not be transferred to ncfl the cost of shares was not paid. ncfl paid the installment of rs.lakhs out of rs. crores before the taking over of the unit. before the take over there was a tripartite agreement between the labour organisations government of bihar and ncfl. the main cause of dispute arose because the monitoring committee decided to transfer the ownership to ncfl before signing of the tripartite agreement. when the negotiations for tripartite agreement began there was a dispute as to which union was to represent the labour. the industries department and the monitoring committee were of the opinion that since ashok paper kamgar union had espoused the cause and had taken lead in filing the petition before this court they should be the to sign the agreement. $$$ the labour commissir called several meetings but the petitir ashok paper kamgar union refused to sign an agreement. when no agreement took place ncfl sought the permission of the industries department to run the unit on the basis of the bipartite agreement which was given in view of the order passed by this court on.. the order passed by this court on.upheld the decision of the industries department. the ncfl claims that till the tripartite agreement was signed its ownership was not complete as the orders passed by this court envisaged a tripartite agreement and this dispute could not be resolved despite several meetings of the monitoring committee. it is further pleaded that the agreement which was entered into by the ncfl with the other union was upheld by this court and the depnt of the affidavit had not committed any contempt of the orders passed by this court. a counter affidavit has been filed by $$$ chairman of ncfl. it is stated therein that m / s ashok paper mills which was promoted in the year y $$$ of $$$ ran into problems and went into liquidation in the year. the governments of bihar and assam and idbi and other institutions took over the company as a joint venture in and the unit started functioning from. since the unit had no pulping facility no provision of captive power supply and several other infrastructural deficiencies the plant became unviable and faced acute financial crisis and closed down in the year. the average production in the aforesaid $$$$ period was a meager.ts per day. ultimately the company made a reference to the bifr in the year. there was only recognised union of the company till its closure in the year namely ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat which was registered in the year. all the certified standing orders and agreements with the erstwhile management were signed by this union al. the petitir ashok paper kamgar union was registered only in the year and was never a recognised union of the mill. when the physical possession of the unit was taken over by the new promoter hcfl on.the assets were delivered short the value whereof was approx. rs.crores as per the inventory and list prepared at the time of handing over. the president of the petitir union namely shri umadhar prasad singh and officials of government of bihar were party to the same. the shortfall of rs.crores took place between the time the idbi prepared its report in january the preparation of the inventory list on.and taking over of physical possession on.despite the orders of this court dated.wherein it was directed that status quo shall be maintained. this shortfall took place as a result of theft pilferage damage etc. which was caused when shri h.p. singh was incharge of the site as acting works manager. the plant and machinery of the unit was very old dating back to the $$$$ -and even $$$$ and the same had been left abandd without any care upkeep or watch. it is further stated that by july ncfi had invested an approximate amount of rs. crores and thereupon idbi disbursed the tranche of rs. crores out of the sanctid amount and this amount was not received by the company but was paid directly to the equipment suppliers. clause.of the approved scheme envisaged a tentative investment of rs.crores share capital of rs.crores and term loan / equipment finance of rs. crores for phase i. the ncfl and its associates had already made investment of rs.crores as against rs.crores as per the scheme. the idbi had granted loan of rs. crores by january against which collateral security of rs. crores of properties other than that of the mill had been furnished by the ncfl. the investment made in the project was many times the value of the old assets handed over to the new promoter who had put their further stake by way of a collateral security of rs. crores. as per clause.of the approved scheme prior to the take over a tripartite agreement between the workers ' union government of bihar and the new management was required to be entered into. in spite of innumerable meetings and deliberations held by the labour commissir the petitir union did not sign the said agreement. copies of the reports dated.and.of the labour commissir have been filed as annexures r- and r- to the counter affidavit. in view of the reports of the labour commissir and the order of the chief minister dated.the management entered into an agreement with the sole recognized union namely ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat which was representing the majority of workers. the state of bihar gave its no objection to the above agreement by way of its letter dated.and this court also passed an order on.that the said agreement was valid for the purpose of implementation of the approved scheme. in para of the counter affidavit it is averred that in spite of clause.of the scheme stipulating the government of bihar to immediately connect the power line to grid power and ensure uninterrupted supply of power to the unit the government of bihar expressed its inability to provide requisite grid power supply for running the $$$. $$$ this court passed an order on.directing the government of bihar to stand guarantee to the tune of rs. crores for procurement of dg sets so that the difficulty of power supply could be obviated. the offer of guarantee of the government of bihar for procuring dg sets was not acceptable either to the term loan institutions or to the banks and till date no effective steps had been taken to ensure power supply. in para it is averred that the entire eligible work force as directed by this court has been in full employment since june and the cost so far incurred on the payment of salary and wages amounted to approx. rs. crores. the mill commenced production on.but it could run only intermittently because of sabotage. under the scheme $$$ed bank of india was to provide a working capital but the same was not d and as a stop gap arrangement the promoters managed to obtain external commercial borrowing from usa to the tune of rs.crores to run the mill. inspection was d by the deputy director technical on.and by a team consisting of industrial development commissir and industry secretary director technical and managing director darbangha industrial area development authority and some others on.and they found that the production was going on in the mill. the mill has more than or so motors running at a time which requires constant repair upkeep and maintenance. apart from motors there is other equipment which also requires constant maintenance and repair. the process of repairing parts can not be carried out at the unit itself and they are required to be sent to specialised workshops outside the mill premises and sometimes to other places. the government of bihar passed an order on.whereby an embargo was placed and it prevented movement of machineries or any part thereof from the factory premises and this resulted in running of the unit coming to a stand still. on.motor connecting the pulp machine to the paper machine got burnt. this could not be repaired at the factory site and was required to be sent to $$$ for repairs. however it could not be sent outside on account of the embargo imposed by the government of bihar and all the efforts to send the motor for repairs failed and the management had to purchase another motor at the cost of rs.lakhs. in paras to of the counter affidavit details of various orders passed by the authorities of government of bihar placing an embargo on removal of any part or machinery from the factory premises the steps taken by ncfl to got them lifted their eventually filing a writ petition in patna high court being cwjc no. of the representation made to the chief minister of bihar the letter addressed by $$$. $$$ chairman of the monitoring committee to the industry department government of bihar have been given. in para it is averred that out of rs. crores approx.an amount of rs. crores approx.was paid by idbi directly to various equipment suppliers. the idbi had also appointed a leading firm of chartered accountant namely m / s l.b. jha & company to report directly to them. the respondent no. $$$ had given personal guarantees and the promoter company ncfl had also arranged collateral security of rs. crores of prime properties situated at napean sea road malabar hills and at nariman point mumbai. a counter affidavit on behalf of idbi has been filed by $$$ deputy general manager of the bank. it is averred therein that the ncfl has paid only installments of rs.lakhs each totalling rs. lakhs out of rs. crores which was decided as consideration for taking over the company 's assets and an account of said default pro rata settlement of dues of secured creditors and workers did not take place. in phase i of the scheme major repairs and rectification work was carried out and certain capital equipment additional waste paper pulping facility coal handling plant boiler of and part of the drinking equipment were acquired. on disbursement of the entire loan of rs. crores by idbi by $$$$ and release of working capital by union bank of india in august the company had started the plant. it produced tonnes of paper upto january with the average daily production being around tonnes as against the capacity of tpd. out of envisaged installation of mw captive power plant mw captive power plant had become operational and a mw turbine had reached the site in july. to meet a part of the cost over run which had occurred on account of procurement of additional machinery delay in implementation of the scheme and higher pre -operative expenses the company had approached idbi for sanction of a loan of rs. crores. the above request of the company was considered and idbi and industrial investment bank of india ltd. sanctid rs.crores each in $$$$ and april respectively. the trial run was taken on.but stopped after days due to break down. there was intermittent working of the plant and the stoppages were reported to be attributable to shortage of fuel for running the captive power plant. the unit had started regular production in october after release of working capital by $$$ed bank of india work of phase ii of the plant which was estimated to cost rs. crores has not commenced. a techno -economic viability study was to be conducted for phase ii and for this purpose quotations were called by idbi from some reputed consultants. the company / ncfl however was not willing to bear even the lowest fees approximating rs. lakhs for this study and therefore it could not be d. the idbi had disbursed the entire loan of rs. crores by.and the delay on the part of the ncfl in acceptance of the terms and conditions of the loan in creation of the collateral security as per the $$$ and other non -compliances with condition alities of the loan resulted in late disbursement of the same. the arrangement regarding giving of guarantee by government of bihar did not work out as no bank / financial institution came forward to finance acquisition of the dg sets on payment of $$$$ rentals of rs.lakhs. in para of the affidavit it is stated that the company as on.had incurred an amount of rs.lakhs for implementation of the project and the same had been made by promoter 's contribution of rs.lakhs ecbs of rs.lakhs secured creditors'/dealers ' deposit of rs.lakhs and idbi term loan of rs. lakhs. in para it is averred that the operations in the plant came to a stand still from.as it was hit by a devastating hailstorm in which the building and the plant and machinery had been substantially damaged. the company has filed an insurance claim of rs.crores with the new india assurance company ltd. and the said claim is yet to be settled. the respondents namely $$$ chairman ncfl shri s. $$$ joint secretary ministry of industry government of india and shri g.s. $$$ secretary department of industry government of bihar have stated in their respective affidavits that they tender their unconditional apology in case the court came to the conclusion that they had committed contempt of the orders passed by this court. according to the petitir the respondents have not complied with the orders passed by this court on..and.and therefore they are liable to be proceeded with. by the order dated.the writ petition was disposed of in terms of the report dated submitted by government of india in consultation with various agencies. the report contained the $$$ for revival of ashok paper mills ltd. and the relevant terms thereof have already been set out earlier. by the order dated.i.a. no. of was disposed of and a direction was issued to all persons and institutions concerned to participate in the implementation of the $$$ and the finance secretary government of india was directed to ensure that the legal conditions are fulfilled and the mill is rehabilitated and both phase i and phase ii of the scheme are given effect to. it was further directed that the arrears of the workers would be taken care of by the committee during the process of implementation. by the order dated.several i.a.s were disposed of on the statements made by the counsel appearing for union of india and the monitoring committee and also the petitir to ensure that the factory is inaugurated and the production commences. the time given to those workmen who were willing to join after giving an undertaking was extended upto.. it may now be examined whether there has been a compliance of the aforesaid orders or the respondents have committed wilful disobedience thereof which may require drawing up appropriate proceedings against them for having committed contempt of the orders passed by this court. the affidavits filed by the parties show that ashok paper mills was promoted by $$$ of $$$ in the year but as the company could not function properly it went into liquidation in. $$$ the government of bihar and the government of assam took over the company as a joint venture in the year. the company did well till but thereafter its performance deteriorated and ultimately the production was suspended in and it was referred to bifr in the machinery and the plant were obviously very old. since the unit remained closed for a long period its condition further deteriorated on account of lack of maintenance. any industrial undertaking having an old machinery and plant can never give optimum result even though substantial investment is made. it appears that this problem was not highlighted when this court entertained the writ petition and directed the government of india government of bihar and the financial institutions to come out with the proposal to revive the industry. various orders were issued keeping in view the welfare of the workmen who had been thrown out of employment. but the fact remained that the machinery being very old and having been kept out of use for long number of $$$$ it was very difficult to run the unit in an efficient manner so that it could be financially viable. the government of bihar had passed an order on.directing the district magistrate $$$ to take necessary action and to ensure that nothing went out of the factory premises. some machines in the factory required repairs and according to the affidavit of shri dharam godha motor got burnt on.. the machines and the motor were required to be sent to calcutta for repairs. however on account of the embargo imposed by the government of bihar the same could not be taken out of the factory. according to the management it wanted to take out scrap worth about rs. -lakhs for the purpose of sale to raise money to pay wages to the workmen. it even filed a writ petition being cwjc no. of before the patna high court praying that direction be issued to permit it to take out the iron scrap for the purpose of sale. the writ petition was disposed of on.with the direction to the monitoring committee to decide the issue regarding removal of scrap for the purposes of payment of wages to the workers. the government of india also sent a letter dated.to the government of bihar requesting it to revoke the direction given by it to the district magistrate on.. the machines installed in a big factory may break down or may need repairs and it is not always possible to repair the same within the factory premises. in such circumstances it is quite natural to send the machines outside the factory premises or even outside the town to a big place for the purpose of repairs. however on account of the orders issued by the government of bihar the management was restrained from taking out the machines and this at times resulted in closure or non -functioning of the factory. another reason given by respondent no. for improper functioning of the $$$ is the non -supply of power. clause.of the $$$ specifically provided that the government of bihar would immediately connect the power lines to grid power and ensure uninterrupted supply of power subject to technical fault. according to the affidavit filed by shri dharam godha the government of bihar expressed its inability to provide requisite grid power supply for running of the unit. $$$ an order was passed by this court on.directing the government of bihar to stand guarantee to the tune of rs. crores for procurement of dg sets so that the unit may get uninterrupted power supply and may not be dependent upon the power supplied from the bihar state electricity board. the offer for guarantee made by the government of bihar was however not acceptable either to the banks or to the financial institutions and as such dg sets could not be obtained. lack of adequate power also contributed in creating serious problem in the running of the unit. in accordance with the orders passed by this court in the writ petition a tripartite agreement had to be entered into between the petitioner namely ashok paper kamgar union government of bihar and ncfl. the material on record shows that though several meetings were held but for some reason or the other the agreement could not fructify and could not be signed shri h.c. $$$ labour commissioner bihar wrote a letter to the secretary industrial development department government of bihar on.complaining that the behavior of the president of the petitioner union had been non -cooperative on many occasions. he frequently tried to create hindrances and showed no interest to reach a settlement for tri -partite agreement. he sent another letter in this connection on.reiterating that shri umadhar prasad singh president of ashok paper kamgar union was creating hurdles in arriving at a tri -partite agreement. the labour commissioner also sent a report that his department had been receiving representations from ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat which was the only recognised union about their claim. after considering the report of the labour commissioner the government of bihar gave its no objection by its letter dated.and thereafter the management entered into an agreement with the aforesaid recognized union namely ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat. in paras and of the $$$ it is alleged that on account of keeping out of the petitioner and its president shri umadhar prasad singh in the meetings of the monitoring committee and on account of their non -involvement in the opening and running of the unit there has been a disobedience of the orders passed by this court. the material on record shows that as shri umadhar prasad singh was not cooperating and was creating hindrance in arriving at a tri -partite agreement the labour commissioner wrote to the government of bihar for signing of the agreement with ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat which was a recognised union. the government of bihar also gave its consent for the same. in these circumstances the fact that the agreement was signed only with ashok paper mill mazdoor panchayat can not amount to wilful disobedience of the orders passed by this court. under the $$$ which was formulated on.and had been approved by this court by the order dated.ncfl had to pay a fixed consideration of rs. crores over a period of years in quarterly installments of rs.lakhs each. the ncfl has no doubt defaulted in payment of the aforesaid amount as it has paid only installments of rs.lakhs each. the idbi has disbursed a term loan of rs. crores towards phase i of the revival scheme. the department of industrial policy and promotion ministry of commerce and industry government of india in cooperation with department of banking was instrumental in obtaining the sanction for additional term loan of rs. crores from idbi and a working capital of rs.crores from united bank of india. therefore so far as the idbi and the department of industrial policy and promotion ministry of commerce and industry government of india are concerned they have complied with the directions issued by this court and have also taken all other steps which they were required to take for the revival of the unit. according to the affidavit filed by shri dharam godha ncfl has invested rs. crores towards promoter 's contribution which was much more than the amount contemplated in phase i of the $$$. it is also averred therein that for the loan of rs. crores given by idbi security of properties situate in mumbai worth rs. crores other than that of the mill had been furnished by ncfl. though the entire amount of consideration has not been paid by the ncfl but they claim to have made substantial investment for running of the unit. section of contempt of courts act defines ' civil contempt and it means willful disobedience to any judgment decree direction order writ or other process of a court or willful breach of undertaking given to a court. $$$ means an act or omission which is done voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to do something the law forbids or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law. it signifies a deliberate action done with evil intent or with a bad motive or purpose. therefore in order to constitute contempt the order of the court must be of such a nature which is capable of execution by the person charged in normal circumstances. it should not require any extra ordinary effort nor should be dependent either wholly or in part upon any act or omission of a party for its compliance. this has to be judged having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case. the facts mentioned above show that none of the respondents to the petition can be held to be directly responsible if the $$$ which had been formulated by government of india on.and had been approved by this court by the order dated.could not be implemented in letter and spirit as many factors have contributed to the same. the reasons given for non inclusion of shri umadhar prasad singh in signing of the agreement appear to be quite plausible. ncfl has undoubtedly not discharged its liability of making payment of its entire liability of rs. crores. however it has come out with a case that some additional expenditure has been incurred in running the unit. it is not possible to get the complete financial picture only on the basis of the affidavits filed in the present petition. on the material on record therefore it is not possible to hold that the charge of having committed contempt of court on account of alleged non -compliance of the orders passed by this court on..and.has been established against any of the respondents. the petition is accordingly dismissed and the notices issued to the respondents are discharged. it is made clear that any observation made in this order is only for the limited purpose of deciding the present contempt petition and shall not be construed as an expression of opinion on the rights and claims of the parties. the order will also not come in the way of any party in seeking to recover its dues or to establish any kind of right or taking any other action.g.p. mathur j. for the reasons given in $$$ no. of in $$$ civil no. of the present petition is dismissed.
