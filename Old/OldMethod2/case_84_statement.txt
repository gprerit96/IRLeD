under delay in filing counter affidavit is condd.leave granted.interpretation and/or application of section of the negotiable instruments act ni act is in question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated.passed by a learned single judge of the high court of judicature at bombay.the basis fact of the matter is not in dispute.several cheques on different dates were issued by the applicant herein which were dishonoured. the complaint petitions in the court of additional chief metropolitan magistrate bandra mumbai. the complaint petitions were filed in the name of the respective payees of the cheques. she also filed affidavits in support of the averments made in the said complaint petitions. cognizance of offence under section of the n.i. act was taken against the $$$. summons were issued. questioning the order issuing summons by the learned magistrate in exercise of his power under section of the $$$ of criminal procedure $$$ herein filed criminal application before the high court of judicature at bombay inter alia contending that the complaint petitions filed by the power of attorney holder was not maintainable and relying thereupon or on the basis thereof the learned magistrate could not have issued summons. the said contention has been negative by the high court in its impugned judgment.in the aforementid premises interpretation of section of the n.i. act comes up for consideration before us. we may notice that in m.m.t.c. and anr. v. medchl chemicals & pharma p ltd. and anr. $$$ / sc/078/00$$$ / sc/078/00 scc a division bench of this court has opined.this court has as far back as in the case of vishwa $$$ v. o.p. poddar $$$ / sc/0378/$$$$$$$ / sc/0378/$$$$ scc held that it is clear that any can set the criminal law in motion by filing a complaint of facts constituting an offence before a magistrate entitled to take cognizance on the sole ground that the complainant was not competent to file the complaint. it has been held that if any special statute prescribes offences and makes any special provision for taking cognizance of such offences under the statute then the complainant requesting the magistrate to take cognizance of the office must satisfy the eligibility criterion prescribed by the statute. in the present case the only eligibility criteria prescribed by section is that the complaint must be by the payee or the holder in due course. this criteria is satisfied as the complaint is in the name and on behalf of the $$$ companyhowever in a later judgment in $$$ and anr. v. indusind bank ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/030/004$$$ / sc/030/004 scc albeit in a different context another division bench of this court overruled the judgment of the bombay high court in pradeep mohanbay v. $$$ / $$$ / mh/0485/999 bom. l.r. inter alia opining as follows order rules and $$$ of civil procedure empowers the holder of power of attorney to $$$ on behalf of the principal. in our view the word acts employed in order rules and $$$ of civil procedure confines only to in respect of acts d by the power -of -attorney holder in exercise of power granted by the instrument. the term acts would not include deposing in place and instead of the principal. in other words if the power of attorney holder has rendered some acts in pursuance of power of attorney he may depose for the principal in respect of such acts but he can not depose for the principal for the acts d by the principal and not by him. similarly he can not depose for the principal in respect of the matter of which only the principal is entitled to be cross -examined.on the question of power of attorney the high courts have divergent views. in the case of shambhu $$$ v. state of rajasthan $$$ / rh/0397/985$$$ / rh/0397/985 wln raj.it was held that a general power -of -attorney holder can appear plead and act on behalf of the party but he can not become a witness on behalf of the party. he can only appear in his own witness box on behalf of himself. to appear in a witness box is altogether a different act. a general power -of -attorney holder can not be allowed to appear as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff in the capacity of the plaintiff.however in the case of humberto luis v. $$$ bom. cr on which reliance has been placed by the tribunal in the present case the high court took a dissenting view and held that the provisions contained in order rule $$$ of civil procedure can not be construed to disentitle the power -of -attorney holder to depose on behalf of his principal. the high court further held that the word $$$ appearing in order rule $$$ of civil procedure takes within its sweep. we are unable to agree with this view taken by the bombay high court in floriano $$$.it is not in dispute that there is a conflict of opinion on this issue amongst various high courts including the decision of bombay high court in $$$ v. pushpadevi kailashkumar agrawal and anr. $$$ / mh/0/005$$$ / mh/0/005 mah. l.j. on the hand and a decision of the $$$ high court in s.p. sampathy v. $$$ and anr. $$$ / ap/07/$$$$$$$ / ap/07/$$$$ crl.l.j. on the other. of the questions which would arise for consideration is as to whether the eligibility criteria prescribed by section of the ni act would stand satisfied if the complaint petition itself is filed in the name of the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque and/or whether a complaint petition has to be presented before the court by the payee or the holder of the cheque himself.another issue which would arise for consideration is as to whether the payee must examine himself in support of the complaint petition keeping in view the insertion of section of the said act act no. of.in our opinion in view of difference of opinion amongst various high courts as also the decisions of this court in m.m.t.c. ltd. supra and $$$ supra particularly in view of the fact that in the later case the earlier was not noticed an authoritative pronouncement is necessary to be given in this regard. we therefore are of the opinion that the matter should be considered by a larger bench. the matter was considered by a larger bench of judges. by judgment dated 3th september reported in manu / sc/0934/$$$$manu / sc/0934/$$$$ scale -a.c. narayanan v. state of maharashtra the said larger bench framed the following questions:(i whether a power of attorney holder can sign and file a complaint petition behalf of the complainant whether the eligibility criteria prescribed by section of ni act would stand satisfied if the complaint petition itself is filed in the name of the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque?(ii whether a power of attorney holder can be varied on oath under section of the $$$?(iii whether specific averments as to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder in the impugned transaction must be explicitly asserted in the complaint?(iv if the power of attorney holder fails to assert explicitly his knowledge in the complaint then can the power of attorney holder verify the complaint on oath on such presumption of knowledge?(v whether the proceedings contemplated under section of the $$$ can be dispensed with in the light of section of the n.i. act which was introduced by an amendment in the year. the question relating to the eligibility of power of attorney holder to sign and file a complaint petition on behalf of the complainants and whether eligibility criteria prescribed by section of n.i. act is satisfied if the complaint petition itself is filed in the name of the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque was answered by larger bench in affirmative by its judgment in a.c. narayanan v. state of maharashtra manu / sc/0934/$$$$manu / sc/0934/$$$$ scale with observation which reads as follows:9 as noticed hereinabove though $$$ supra relates to powers of power of attorney holder under $$$ of civil procedure but it was concluded therein that a plaint by a power of attorney holder on behalf of the original plaintiff is maintainable provided he has personal knowledge of the transaction in question. in a way it is an exception to a well settled position that criminal law can be put in motion by any vide vishwa $$$ supra and under the $$$ stranger to transaction in question namely legal heir etc.can also carry forward the pending criminal complaint or initiate the criminal action if the original complainant dies vide ashwin nanubhai vyas v. state of maharashtra manu / sc/00/9manu / sc/00/9 scr. keeping in mind various situations like inability as a result of sickness old age or death or staying abroad of the payee or holder in due course to appear and depose before the court in order to prove the complaint it is permissible for the power of attorney holder or for the legal representative(s to file a complaint and/or continue with the page pending criminal complaint for and on behalf of payee or holder in due course. however it is expected that such power of attorney holder or legal representative(s should have knowledge about the transaction in question so as to able to bring on record the truth of the grievance / offence otherwise no criminal justice could be achieved in case payee or holder in due course is unable to sign appear or depose as complainant due to above quoted reasons. keeping these aspects in mind in mmtc supra this court had taken the view that if complaint is filed for and on behalf of payee or holder in due course that is good enough compliance with section of.i. act. the question relating to verification of power of attorney holder on oath as prescribed under section of the code was answered as follows:0 the stand of the $$$ in criminal appeal no. of is that no complaint can be filed and no cognizance of the complaint can be taken if the complaint is by the power of attorney holder since it is against section of the code and deserves to be rejected. there is no dispute that complaint has to be filed by the complainant as contemplated by section of the code but the said section does not create any embargo that the attorney holder or legal representative(s can not be a complainant.from a conjoint reading of sections and of the n.i. act as well as section of the code it is clear that it is open to the magistrate to issue process on the basis of the contents of the complaint documents in support thereof and the affidavit submitted by the complainant in support of the complaint. once the complainant files an affidavit in support of the complaint before issuance of the process under section of the code it is thereafter open to the magistrate if he thinks fit to call upon the complainant to remain present and to examine him as to the facts contained in the affidavit submitted by the complainant in support of his complaint. however it is a matter of discretion and the magistrate is not bound to call upon the complainant to remain present before the court and to examine him upon oath for taking decision whether or not to issue process on the complaint under section of the n.i. act. for the purpose of issuing process under section of the code it is open to the magistrate to rely upon the verification in the form of affidavit filed by the complainant in support of the complaint under section of the n.i. act. it is only if and where the magistrate after considering the complaint under section of the n.i. act documents produced in support thereof and the verification in the form of affidavit of the complainant is of the view that examination of the complainant or his witness(s is required the magistrate may call upon the complainant to remain present before the court and examine the complainant and/or his witness upon oath for taking a decision whether or not to issue process on the complaint under section of the n.i. act.in the light of the discussion we are of the view that the power of attorney holder may be allowed to file appear and depose for the purpose of issue of process for the offence punishable under section of the n.i. act. an exception to the above is when the power of attorney holder of the complainant does not have a personal knowledge about the transactions then he can not be examined. however where the attorney holder of the complainant is in charge of the business of the complainant payee and the attorney holder al is personally aware of the transactions there is no reason why the attorney holder can not depose as a witness. nevertheless an explicit assertion as to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder about the transaction in question must be specified in the complaint. on this count the question becomes infructuous.in view of the discussion we are of the opinion that the attorney holder can not file a complaint in his own name as if he was the complainant but he can initiate criminal proceedings on behalf of his principal. we also reiterate that where the payee is a proprietary concern the complaint can be filed i by the proprietor of the proprietary concern describing himself as the sole proprietor of the payee the proprietary concern describing itself as a sole proprietary concern represented by its sole proprietor and the proprietor or the proprietary concern represented by the attorney holder under a power of attorney executed by the sole proprietor.similar substantial questions were raised in the appeal arising out of s.l.p. crl.no. of which stand answered as above. apart from the above questions distinct query was raised as to whether a person authorized by a company or statute or institution can delegate powers to their subordinate / others for filing a criminal complaint the issue raised is in reference to validity of sub -delegation of functions of the power of attorney. we have already clarified to the extent that the attorney holder can sign and file a complaint on behalf of the complainant -payee. however whether the power of attorney holder will have the power to further delegate the functions to another person will completely depend on the terms of the general power of attorney. as a result the authority to sub -delegate the functions must be explicitly mentid in the general power of attorney. otherwise the sub -delegation will be inconsistent with the general power of attorney and thereby will be invalid in law. nevertheless the general power of attorney itself can be cancelled and be given to another person. while holding that there is no serious conflict between the decisions in mmtc supra and $$$ supra the larger bench clarified the position and answered the questions framed in the following manner:(i filing of complaint petition under section of.i. act through power of attorney is perfectly legal and competent.the power of attorney holder can depose and verify on oath before the court in order to prove the contents of the complaint. however the power of attorney holder must have witnessed the transaction as an agent of the payee / holder in due course or possess due knowledge regarding the said transactions.it is required by the complainant to make specific assertion as to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder in the said transaction explicitly in the complaint and the power of attorney holder who has no knowledge regarding the transactions can not be examined as a witness in the case.in the light of section of.i. act it is open to the magistrate to rely upon the verification in the form of affidavit filed by the complainant in support of the complaint under section of the n.i. act and the magistrate is neither mandatorily obliged to call upon the complainant to remain present before the court nor to examine the complainant of his witness upon oath for taking the decision whether or not to issue process on the complaint under section of the n.i. act.the functions under the general power of attorney can not be delegated to another person without specific clause permitting the same in the power of attorney. nevertheless the general power of attorney itself can be cancelled and be given to another person.case of a.c. narayanan1. in this case magistrate had taken cognizance of the complaint without prima facie establishing the fact as to whether the power of attorney existed in place and whether it was in order. it is not in dispute that the complaint against the $$$ was not preferred by the payee or the holder in due course and the statement on oath of the person who filed the complaint has also not stated that he filed the complaint having been instructed by the payee or holder in due course of the cheque. since the complaint was not filed abiding with the provisions of the act it was not open to the magistrate to take cognizance. from the bare perusal of the said complaint it can be seen that except mentioning in the cause title there is no mention of or a reference to the power of attorney in the body of the said complaint nor was it exhibited as part of the said complaint. further in the list of evidence there is just a mere mention of the words at serial no. viz. power of attorney however there is no date or any other particulars of the power of attorney mentid in the complaint. even in the verification statement made by the respondent no. there is not even a whisper that she is filing the complaint as the power of attorney holder of the complainant. even the order of issue of process dated $$$$ does not mention that the magistrate had perused any power of attorney for issuing process. the $$$ has stated that his advocate conducted search and inspection of the papers and proceedings of the criminal complaint and found that no power of attorney was found to be a part of that record. this has not been disputed by the respondents. in that view of the matter and in light of decision of the larger bench as referred above we hold that the magistrate wrongly took cognizance in the matter and the court below erred in putting the onus on the $$$ rather than the complainant. the aforesaid fact has also been overlooked by the high court while passing the impugned judgment dated 12th august. in the result the impugned judgment dated 12th august passed by the high court of judicature at bombay and the order dated 29th november passed by the additional chief metropolitan magistrate 9th court bandra mumbai are set aside and the proceedings in question against the $$$ are quashed.case of g. kamalakar20. in this case it is not in dispute that the complaint was filed by shri v. shankar prasad claiming to be general power of attorney of the complainant company. subsequently$$$ shri ravinder singh gave the evidence on behalf of the company under the general power of attorney given by the complainant company. the complaint was not signed either by managing director or director of the company. it is also not in dispute that$$$ is only the employee of the company. as per resolution of the company i. ex. p3 under part managing director and director are authorized to file suits and criminal complaints against the debtors for recovery of my and for prosecution. under part of the said resolution they were authorized to appoint or nominate any other person to appear on their behalf in the court and engage lawyer etc. but nothing on the record suggest that an employee is empowered to file the complaint on behalf of the company. this apart managing director and director are authorized persons of the company to file the complaint by signing and by giving evidence. at best the said persons can nominate any person to represent themselves or the company before the court. in the present case shri shankar prasad employee of the company signed the complaint and the deputy general manager of the company i. $$$ gave evidence as if he knows everything though he does not know anything. there is nothing on the record to suggest that he was authorized by the managing director or any director. therefore magistrate by judgment dated 30th october rightly acquitted the $$$. in such a situation the case of the $$$ is fully covered by decision by the larger bench of this court passed in the present appeal. we have no other option but to set aside the impugned judgment dated 19th september passed by the high court of judicature $$$ at hyderabad in criminal appeal no. of. the judgment and order dated 30th october passed by the court of xviii metropolitan magistrate hyderabad in c.c. no. of is upheld. the appeals are allowed accordingly.
