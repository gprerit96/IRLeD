a.k. sikri and $$$ jj. leave granted. we have heard the matter finally with the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the parties. the short question which is involved in this $$$ is as to whether the debt recovery tribunal hereinafter referred to as $$$ has power to condone the delay in filing the $$$. the appellants have filed the $$$ against the $$$ of the recovery officer before the drt under section of the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act hereinafter referred to as act for short. there is a limitation period of days provided for filing such an $$$. however there was a delay of days in filing the $$$ which was condoned by the drt. this $$$ was challenged before the high court and the high court has set aside the $$$ of the drt on the ground that limitation act does not apply to the proceedings before the drt. this question of the high court is contrary to the specific provisions contained in sections & of the act which reads as . $$$ to the appellate tribunal.save as provided in sub -section any person aggrieved by an $$$ made or deemed to have been made by a tribunal under this act may prefer an $$$ to an appellate tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter.no $$$ shall lie to the appellate tribunal from an $$$ made by a tribunal with the consent of the parties.every $$$ under sub -section shall be filed within $$$$ -days from the date on which a copy of the $$$ made or deemed to have been made by the tribunal is received by him and it shall be in such form and be accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed provided that the appellate tribunal may entertain an $$$ after the expiry of the said period of -days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period.on receipt of an $$$ under sub -section the appellate tribunal may after giving the parties to the $$$ an opportunity of being heard pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit confirming modifying or setting aside the order appealed against.the appellate tribunal shall send a copy of every $$$ made by it to the parties to the $$$ and to the concerned tribunal.the $$$ filed before the appellate tribunal under sub -section shall be dealt with by it as expeditiously as possible and endeavour shall be made by it to dispose of the $$$ finally within months from the date of receipt of the $$$. limitation.--the provisions of the limitation act of shall as far as may be apply to an application made to a tribunal. it is clear form the aforesaid section that specific power is given to the drt to condone the delay. therefore the high court order is clearly unsustainable and is set aside. the appeal is remitted back to the drt for deciding on merits. having regard to the nature of the dispute involved we direct the drt to decide the appeal preferred against the order of the recovery officer within $$$$ months from the date of receipt of the copy of this order. the appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
