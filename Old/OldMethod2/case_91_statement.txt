s.b. sinha j. questions of some importance arise for consideration in this application filed by the respondent -herein under sections and of the arbitration act questioning an award dated.passed by learned arbitrators appointed by this court.background facts:. army welfare housing organization for short awho and $$$. ltd. for short entered into an agreement for development of land and construction of a composite housing project on a turn -key basis on approximately.acres of land situate on the vip road in the town of kolkata. for the said purpose a draft agreement initially drawn up was given finality by articles of agreement dated.. certain terms and conditions however had been altered therein with mutual consent. the project was envisaged to be completed in phases. considerable progress was made in the matter of construction of work in phase i. the plots where the said work was being carried out fell under the local administration of gopalpur arjunpur $$$. the building plan for phase i was sanctid by the said $$$ in $$$$ in terms whereof blocks of houses could be constructed. the said area however became a municipality in terms of the west bengal municipal act known as $$$. west bengal municipality act however was repealed and replaced by west bengal municipal act. it is not in dispute that pursuant to or in furtherance of the said agreement entered into negotiations with the owners of the agricultural lands for sale thereof where for sale deeds in respect of.acres of land were executed by the owners in favour of awho.  received the amount for consideration from awho paid to the owners upon furnishing a bank guarantee as also subject to the condition that it will get the said land converted into bastu. lands measuring about acres had already been converted into bastu. on or about.an application was made by awho for modifications or revisions in the master plan where for a revised master plan was submitted for approval of the municipality stating:"tel welfare housing organisationsouth hutments kashmir house $$$ new delhi-b/000/cal -ii / awho dec the chairman $$$ $$$ $$$-00submission and final approval of plan from municipal authoritydear sir,. this is to bring to your kind notice that our organization has undertaken the construction of own your own house housing project for the benefit of our defence personnel at no profit no loss basis. we have engaged m / s dulal mukherjee & associates as consulting architect for the project. as per demand / requirements for the housing for army personnel our architect made a master plan of the project and also plans for types of dwelling units storyed which were approved by the gram panchayat vide sanction no. dated sep.. in this connection we would like to mention that due to site constraints and also to meet the demand for housing among army personnel minor modifications / revisions have been made to the master plan and also to the individual dwelling units which were sanctid earlier. we are submitting herewith the revised master plan and also individual plan for dwelling units additions and alterations for your approval. we therefore make an appeal to your goodself to kindly give special consideration to our plan and approve the same at the earliest.yours faithfully,(raghu $$$ retd)dt & dy mdfor managing director". such permission was granted only on.. according to despite the fact that no building plan was filed or sanctid for phase ii and phase iii but as per instruction of awho it proceeded with the construction of phase ii such an application was filed for the time on.. it stands admitted that the proposed height of the towers was more than the permissible. the municipal authorities vide its letter dated.directed stoppage of work in / blocks where allegedly unauthorized construction was being carried out stating:"we came to learn that some a blocks of storied buildings were approved by erstwhile panchayat before the origination of the above municipality. after the birth on.as per norms of w.b.m. act ' and $$$ new plans if any or construction job if any has to be approved of by this municipal authority.we learnt some additional blocks are being constructed at your vip project for which no plan was submitted to the engineering division of this office for approval. this is a gross violation of w.b.m. act ' and t & c development -planning act.it is further learnt that the blocks constructed by you on the basis of the plan sanctid by erstwhile panchayat has also been severely deviated from actuality -which is also punishable under the law.we strongly believe that an esteemed organization like you will not indulge in such illegal activities and refrain from all such unapproved / unauthorized works.  thereafter sought advice of awho by a letter dated $$$$ pointing out therein that if any construction activity is carried out despite objections of local authority persons involved would be liable for punishment both under criminal as well as civil law. it reiterated the said stand by a letter dated th $$$$ drawing awho 's attention to the provisions of sections. and of the west bengal municipal act and requesting it for its response also to its earlier letter dated $$$$.  did not receive any reply thereto and hence by its letter dated th $$$$ $$$$ clear out instructions are not received from you by $$$$ we shall be compelled to demobilize. please advise urgently. we shall be constrained to consider your silence as your agreement to our demobilization. the engineers of municipality visited the project site a number of times but the sanctid plan had allegedly not been produced. in the aforementid situation the chairman of the municipality issued a letter to the project manager awho on.stating:"dear sir our engineers have visited your project site number of times and discussed with your engineers about the drawing design and other infrastructures projects placed before them. the undersigned also took the opportunity to meet with you and talk to your m / s dulal mukherjee a associates where we have inter changed our views and the norms of municipal rules & regulations.our engineer has been asking you for the erstwhile panchayat recommended plan by which you have constructed already -blocks. all the time he has come back without result.you would appreciate that without a plan already approved by erstwhile panchayat we can not check / judge the present position or the viability of your project. hence the question of your infrastructural development like construction of road drains etc. does not arise at all at the moment.we would request you fervently to submit the panchayat recommended plan on the basis of which we will proceed further.thanking you"(emphasis $$$. in the meantime the architect and the project engineer of awho met the chairman of the municipality and it was allegedly agreed that the work need not be stopped in the buildings for which the plans have already been approved.  therefore was advised not to stop the work for which plans have already been approved. see letter of awho to dated.. awho by their letters dated th july and august advised to reorganize and recommence its work by employing sufficient strength of labour and bringing the required material to site by september to ensure that the progress of the work is substantially increased. it was threatened that if suitable action is not taken in this be by $$$ may be compelled to take action under $$$ of the contract. it appears that replied thereto by its letter dated th august. in its response to the said letter dated th august. awho drew the attention of to the fact that there are certain types of work which would not come within the purview of the stop work notice by the municipality and as such the same could have been carried out. it was stated..you are again advised to reorganise your work by employing sufficient labour and bringing in the required material to ensure that the progress of the work is substantially increased by sep failing which awho may be compelled to take action under $$$ on page of contract agreement. this is without prejudice to any other right or remedy which shall have accrued or shall accrue to the organisation. some correspondences thereafter passed between the parties and by its letter dated 0th october awho ultimately cancelled the contract with effect from th october. a civil suit was filed by before $$$$ assistant district judge at barasat being suit no. of praying for a declaration that the contract was void. certain consequential reliefs were also prayed therein in relation to the said termination of contract. an application purported to be under section of the arbitration act was filed by the awho before the delhi high court which was marked as suit no. of for appointment of an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement contained in clause of the general terms and conditions of the contract. in the said civil suit prayed for an order of injunction which was refused where against an appeal was preferred in the high court of $$$ and by reason of an interim order dated.the parties were directed to maintain status quo. a slp was filed by awho against the said order. this court in the said s.l.p.however without going into the correctness or otherwise of the interim order dated.of the high court passed the following order:"leave granted.this appeal calls in question the order of the high court of $$$ dated..in view of the developments which have taken place in this court it is not necessary to refer to the detailed facts of the case. admittedly disputes and differences have arisen between the parties and those are pending adjudication in the court of the first assistant district judge barasat title suit no. of and in the high court of delhi suit no. of. it is agreed to by learned counsel for the parties that those disputes and differences be referred for adjudication to an arbitrator. with consent of the parties we refer the disputes arising out of the suits noticed above to shri h.r. $$$ former judge of this court who shall enter upon the reference and make his award within the statutory period. the learned arbitrator shall fix his own fee and the manner of its payment. the parties shall be at liberty to file their claims / counter -claim before the arbitrator.with the reference of the disputes and differences between the parties to the learned arbitrator the suits pending at barasat and in the delhi high court shall stand withdrawn from the respective courts where those are pending. copy of this order shall be sent to the concerned courts for due compliance.the learned arbitrator shall file the award in this court. it is directed that no other court shall interdict the arbitration proceedings.the appeal is disposed of accordingly. no costs. even before filing the statements of claims and counter -claims the parties jointly requested the learned arbitrator to pass an interim award as regard the ownership of the lands as to whether awho by reason of the purported deeds of sale became the absolute owner of the property comprising.acres of land where for the following issues were raised by whether or not awho / party no. is the absolute owner of the suit property comprising of.acres of land vide registered $$$ mutation and conversion certificates issued by the competent authority in favour of the petitir including the properties built thereon and that the land so acquired absolutely and for ever by the party no. and the property built thereon is not a returnable security which property pursuant to the cancellation of contract is neither refundable nor can be same be reconveyed to party no. and/or land sellers?b whether party no. and/or party no. and/or the land sellers have a and paramount charge on the said land sold transferred to the party no. absolutely and forever particulars whereof are given the annexures colly annexed hereto and that whether after sale of the said plots of land by the land sellers to the party no. vide registered sale deed based upon an understanding as spelled out in the developer 's agreement and power of attorney and affidavits etc. executed by and between the land seller and party no. which as is alleged by party no. have since become void and inoperative and therefore is the party no. entitled for the payment of a sum of rs. lakhs as pleaded in paragraph of its title suit no. of whether the party no. has a and paramount charge on the construction buildings and all other materials that are lying at and within the land transferred / sold by the land sellers through party no. to the party no. for it 's claim on the basis of item rate contract as alleged claimed for the alleged loss and damages suffered by the party no. as stated in it 's title suit no. of whether in alternative a decree for specific performance of the agreement referred to in paragraph of the aforesaid title suit above and reconveyance of the lands mentid in schedule g to the suit in favour of the party no. or the land seller can be decreed either in favour of the party no. and / the land sellers who had sold absolutely and for ever their plots of land vide registered sale deeds which were subsequently mutated and its land use changed from agricultural to residential by the competent authority under the west bengal land reform act in favour of the party no. but are now claiming that the deed of sale was in reality a document or security?e whether or not the keys of the godown at contract site which the party no. is illegally holding in it 's custody be given back to party no. to utilize the stores contained therein before commencing the work.any other relief in the circumstances of the case may also be passed / awarded. the learned arbitrator however was not inclined to accede to the said request. $$$ an application was filed by awho before the learned arbitrator to the effect that it may be allowed to commence and complete uninterrupted construction work as well as development of the housing project at the risk of $$$. $$$ filed a reply to the said application. an order was passed on the said application of awho by the learned arbitrator on.subject to the following conditions:(a the question as to whether such an order can be passed at the risk of $$$ can be raised only at the time of final award.the development work may be confined to.acres of land which was the subject matter of sale and which it was stated had been demarcated at the site.all those works could be subject to the ultimate decision of the case.awho shall not give final possession of any of those flats or part of the land to any including the person described as allottees.the said order was without prejudice to any of the contentions which may be raised by the parties.constructions and development work would be of the same kind and specifications as were provided in the contract at competitive rates through an established contractor after inviting tenders therefore. it was further stated therein it is agreed by both the parties that the contract produce for the construction of towers and such towers already exist on the site. if any new tower is constructed by party no. or its contractor party no. would not be liable for it. a review application was filed before the arbitrator by $$$ wherein several questions including the power of arbitrator to pass an interim order of injunction were raised but the same was rejected stating:"it has been vehemently argued that the arbitrator has no power to make the kind of interlocutory order made on november. in this respect learned counsel for party no. has also emphasized that effected the once the prayer for interim award has not been granted the order dated november which was in the nature of an interim award was unwarranted. i find myself unable to accede to this contention. so far as that order is concerned it was made expressly clear that the said order would be without prejudice to any of the contentions which might be raised by the parties. it was also added that all the works which party no. is being allowed to do would be subject to the ultimate decision of the case the order thus makes it clear that there was no finality attached to that order and that it would be subjected to the ultimate decision of the case. as such the order can not be deemed to be an interim award.coming to the other contention that the arbitrator has no power to make an interlocutory order dated november. i find that the work of measurements has been smoothly carried out and the results of measurements have been accepted by both the parties. as the proceedings of arbitration would take considerable time before the final award is given to expedite the execution of the remaining unfinished work party no. was allowed to commence and complete the unfinished work which was the subject matter of the contract between the parties. in my opinion the order made on november was in the interest of justice and not to let the remaining work reaming unfinished till the time of the final award. as the order was made debito justitiae it call for no review or modification. in any case it has been made clear that this order would be subject to the final decision of the case and without prejudice to any of the rights of the parties.another point made in the application of party no. is that it was working as stated in the order of november that blocks / buildings existed at site have g through the order dated november and no where it is stated therein that blocks / buildings exist at the site.i therefore find no ground to review / modify the order dated november. the application accordingly stands disposed of. the learned arbitrator therefore did not determine the question as to whether he had jurisdiction to pass an interim order or not. no award was not passed by the arbitrator for a long time although several extensions had been granted. on or about.an application for revocation of the authority of the arbitrator was filed by $$$ and by an order dated.this court constituted a board of arbitrators instead and place of the sole arbitrator. the award was filed before this court on.by the learned arbitrators where against $$$ filed an application on or about th july under sections and of the act.award:. before the arbitrators both the parties filed their respective claims. claim no. of awho related to the title ownership and possession of.acres of land. claim no. of awho related to cost of completion of balance work at the risk and expense of $$$. both the claims were allowed by the learned arbitrators. claim no. related to compensation for delay in performance of the contract by $$$ whereas claim no. related to damages for non -completion of work resulting in loss of rentals to allottees of awho. claim no. related to reimbursement of payments made by awho towards the premium on $$$ 's all risk insurance policy. claim no. related to damages for delay in transfer of land. all these claims were disallowed. the claim on interest contained in claim no. and claim of costs of arbitration in claim no. were also allowed. the claim of $$$ relating to title of.acres of land and claim for an amount of rs. being an alternative claim was disallowed. the learned arbitrators in making the award formulated as many as issues which have been answered in the following terms:"issue no. we have found that sspl had failed to discharge their obligation in terms of the agreement dated august the issue is decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issue no. we have found that awho were entitled to terminate the said contract and to get the balance work executed at the expense and risk of sspl the issue is decided in favour of awho and against sspl.issue no. since we have found that awho are the full owner and in possession of.acres of land in dispute and the property built thereon the issue is decided in favour of awho and against sspl.issues nos. & we are of the view that the sale deeds executed in favour of awho can not be regarded as documents by way of security for the advance taken by sspl from awho and that no charge was created on the lands indispute the issues are decided in favour of awho and against sspl.issue no. since we have held that the claims made by awho fall within the ambit of the scope of reference as laid down in the order of the hon'ble supreme court the issue is decided in favour of awho and against sspl.issues nos. & submission was made on be of sspl with regard to these issues. the issues are decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issues nos. & we have found that as per the agreement between awho and dma the architect was to provide drawings and specifications of the proposed flats and external services and it was the duty of sspl to take follow up action in the matter of obtaining sanction from the statutory bodies and it was not the responsibility of the architect to obtain sanction from the statutory bodies including the municipality the issues are decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issues nos. & we have found that the agreement dated august and the preceding letter of intent dated january and the draft agreement dated december can not be said to have become impossible of performance and can not be regarded to have become void on the ground of frustration the issues are decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issue no. has been found that the construction in respect of the units in phase i was started after obtaining the sanction for the plans from the gram panchayat and though there were some deviations and alterations from the sanctid plan but the same could be regularized. as regards the units which were to be constructed in phase ii it has been found that the said construction was made without obtaining the sanction for the plans from the competent authority but the plans had been submitted for approval during the course of construction and the said plans were subsequently approved on april and the plans for the whole project were also revalidated. this issue is decided accordingly.issue no. have found that the deviations and the alterations in respect of construction in phase i were not very material in nature and could be regularized and were in fact regularized when the revised plans were sanctid and revalidated by the municipality. this issue is decided accordingly.issue no. have found that payments for the rars for the construction work upto august were not made since sspl failed to abide by their commitment to transfer the balance land by february and subsequently on the transfer of the balance land in august and after execution of the agreement dated august the payments for the said work were made. this issue is decided accordingly.issue no. have found that ssfl never raised any objection regarding construction in respect of works in phase ii on the ground that there were no sanctid plans for the same and sspl obtained benefit in the matter of release of payments on the basis of the order placed for such construction. this issue is decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issue no. has been found that the municipality stopped construction work in phase ii but subsequently the plans for phase ii were approved by the municipality on april. the issue is decided accordingly.issue no. have found that awho issued the working drawings for the project to sspl and the delay in issuing some of the drawings was not very material. the issue is decided accordingly.issue no. submissions were made by sspl in support of this issue. the issue is accordingly decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issues nos. & alterations in the lay out of the built up area of phase i buildings were made by awho in the full knowledge of sspl and the said alterations were not material because they were subsequently revalidated by the municipality in sanctioning the revised plans. the issues are accordingly decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issue no. was no change in the height of the buildings in respect of phase i inasmuch as the height of the blocks in phase i were not above the heights as per the sanctid plans. the heights of the blocks constructed in phase ii for which plans had not been approved were in excess of the height limitations prescribed in the buildings regulations. no. objection certificate has been granted by the airport authorities of india ltd. and it was open to the state government to relax the height limitation. the issue is accordingly decided against sspl and in favour of awho.issues no. have found that the title to the lands transferred in favour of awho under the various sale deeds passed in favour of awho independent of the turnkey project and failure of the turnkey project did not have any bearing on the transfer of title. the issue is accordingly decided in favour of awho and against sspl.issue no. submissions were made by sspl with regard to this issue and the issue is decided against sspl.issue no. have found that awho are entitled to compensation under claim no. towards cost of completion of the balance work at the risk and expense of sspl since sspl failed to perform their part of the obligation under the contract. the issue is decided in favour of awho and against sspl.issue no. have found that the title ownership and possession of.acres of land which was transferred in favour of awho under the various sale deeds vests exclusively with awho and claim no. made by awho has therefore been allowed. the issue is decided in favour of awho accordingly.issue no. have found that sspl are not entitled to reversion of land. the issue is accordingly decided against sspl.issue no. have found that sspl are not entitled to recover any amount from awho. the issue is therefore decided against sspl.issue no. since we have found issue no. against sspl and found that sspl are not entitled to recover any amount from awho therefore the question of their entitlement to recover interest from awho does not arise. the said issue is decided against sspl. in terms of the aforementid findings the learned arbitrators awarded:"we make the award in the following terms:. the claim of sspl that land admeasuring.acres and structures thereon comprising of the blocks / buildings or any other construction that maybe d by awho during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings vests and is owned fully exclusively and absolutely by sspl is disallowed. the alternative claim of sspl for an amount of rs.is disallowed. claim no. of awho in respect of title ownership and possession of land

other incidental expenses for the conduct of the arbitral proceedings. each party shall bear the costs and expenses incurred by it for prosecuting the arbitral proceedings.submissions:. mr. k.n. bhat the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of $$$ would raise the following contentions:(i a bare perusal of the award would show that the learned arbitrators ignored the terms of the agreement.in terms of clause of the general conditions of contract awho could maintain a claim as regard excess amount required for completion of the unfinished work only if the work was completed before a claim was raised or an estimate of the cost of completion is certified by the named architect. despite the fact that n of the aforementid conditions were fulfilled the award was made allegedly on the ground that clause will have no application while the completion was permitted by an order passed in a arbitral proceedings. mr. bhat would contend that the arbitrators being creature of the agreement were required to act within the corners thereof and can not by reason of an interim order override the basis of the agreement.clause of the general conditions of contract would come into play only when the contract is validly terminated in terms of clause. the termination of contract by awho was on the ground that $$$ did not resume work in relation whereto the learned arbitrators failed to consider that the question of resumption of work by it did not arise as the municipality had banned further construction activities. furthermore the arbitrators proceeded also on a wrong premise that $$$ failed to obtain sanction of building plans from the municipal authorities.as the plans were not sanctid at the relevant time by statutory authorities section of the contract act was attracted having regard to the fact that it was commercially incapable of being performed upon passing of the ban order.an award ignoring material and relevant documents would be rendered illegal and bad in law. as in the case the arbitrators ignored the letter dated th december of awho for regularization of deviations and thus thereby they must be deemed to have admitted that deviations were d by them deliberately to suit their own convenience and as such the arbitrators must be held to have misconducted themselves and the proceeding.vi furthermore being a reasd award wrong application of law would vitiate the award.vii the award of the arbitrators is vitiated in law as an agreement purported to have been entered into by and between awho and the architect was enforced against $$$ although it was not a party thereto.viii the finding of the arbitrator that the frustration was a self -induced is not based on any pleadings or materials on record. in any event collusion between $$$ and the municipal authorities was neither pleaded nor proved.ix in any view of the matter the learned arbitrator committed a legal misconduct insofar as they applied a wrong principle of law as regard determination of quantum of damages. in support of the aforementid contentions reliance has been placed by mr. bhat on steel authority of india ltd. v. j.c. budharaja government and mining $$$ $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ airsc shyama charan agarwala & sons v. union of india scc $$$ th edition pages and and martens v. home freeholds co. ltd. and ors. all e.r. rep.. mr. $$$ the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant on the other hand would submit that as the learned arbitrator passed an interim order with the consent of the parties $$$ at a later stage can not be permitted to take a different stand. in view of the interim order passed by of the learned arbitrators a notice inviting tender was issued whereafter contract was awarded to a party and thus the bid made pursuant thereto could validly be made the basis of determination of quantum of damages. the plea of frustration of contract raised by $$$ has rightly been rejected by the learned arbitrators as the same was a self -induced having regard to the fact that it itself got the ban orders issued by the municipal authorities. in any event $$$ in terms of the contract being liable for obtaining sanction of the building plans must be held to have failed to perform its part of contract and consequentially has rightly been held liable for damages.findings interim order passed by of the arbitrators:. a bare perusal of the order of the learned arbitrator dated st november would clearly show that interim award was prayed for by the parties which would have granted substantial reliefs sought for by them in relation to the title in respect of.acres of land. it is admitted that the parties cooperated with each other in the matter of measurement of completed and uncompleted works in terms of the arbitrator 's order dated th may passed in the arbitration proceedings the compliance whereof was recorded in of order dated th august. the learned arbitrator admittedly was not inclined to pass an interim award on the requests of the parties whereafter only on or about rd october an application was filed by awho stating:"that the development of the housing project is carried out by party no. for it 's allottees on no profit no loss basis which is self financed by the allottees of party no. due to breach of contract committed by the party no. allottees of party no. have been denied shelter as well as their life time investments and are suffering for the want of shelters for themselves and their families. substantial time has already been lost due to non -performance of party no. and any delay in commencement of the construction activity will cause immense financial misery and loss of further time which can not be given back by any to the allottees. in order to obviate the sufferings of of allottees who have invested their hard earned my. party no. therefore prays to the hon'ble arbitrator to grant party no. following relief. the prayer therein is as under:"in the premise it is most respectfully prayed that in order to enable party no. to commence early and unjustified completion of unfinished work as well as development of the housing project at the risk of the party no. permission and liberty may be granted to party no. to forthwith take such steps to commence and complete the unfinished works including all such development work on.acres of land owned by party no. at vip road $$$ as may be fit and appropriate for the normal functioning of the housing project and peaceful and safe habitation of the allottees of the party no. .party no. it 's directors officers employees agents and/or attorneys be also directed to hand over the keys of the stores offices and material lying at contract site which keys the party no. is illegally holding in it 's custody. the materials lying at site have already been paid for by party no.party no. it 's directors employees agents and/or attorneys be directed not to interfere in any manner in the development and construction of the unfinished housing project by party no. through such agencies as party no. may deem fit and proper. $$$ filed a detailed reply thereto. $$$ further stated that the awho was not the owner of the property and the real object for such an application was to dispossess $$$. it was further pointed out that such undertaking of the contract job by a party would frustrate the present arbitration agreement as a result whereof further disputes may arise. it was contended:"0. the adjudication of this application without a full -fledged examination of the issues which have been raised by the parties in these proceedings would render the entire arbitration proceedings infructuous. it is further stated that after such directions as prayed for are given the party no. will be deprived of the fruits of any relief which it might obtain on final resolution of the disputes involved in this arbitration proceedings. the allegations contained in the petition are denied except those which are admitted in records of proceedings. the purported cancellation or termination is wrongful. the question of completing the balance work / construction at the risk and cost of party no. does not arise. the basis of the development of the housing project between party no. and its allottees are not known and are neither admitted. it is denied that party no. has committed any breach. the allegation relating to shelter and/or lifetime investments or suffering are not admitted and in any event can not override legal rights. it is denied that time has been lost due to alleged non -performance of party no. since the party no. is willing to return all mys which are due to the party no. the question of suffering financial misery of loss can not arise and the party no. can not put the blame on the party no. in these facts and circumstances. the construction work commenced on blocks only out of a total ordered blocks over an area of.acres approximately. the said total area of.acres and the construction thereon belongs to the party no. and the party no. is entitled to deal with the same. the area of.acres over which no construction have been made also belongs to the party no. and the party no. is entitled to deal with the same.it is therefore not correct to contend that the said order was passed on consent of the parties. for all intent and purport. $$$ could not have consented to grant of such a prayer which would virtually put a final seal over the disputes. we have hereto- before quoted the purported order dated $$$$ which facie demonstrate that the arbitrator assumed jurisdiction to pass the said interim order at the behest of awho. furthermore as noticed hereinbefore $$$ filed a review application which was also dismissed in the manner noticed hereinbefore. the said interim order was thus not passed with consent of parties. if the learned arbitrator has no jurisdiction to pass an interim order even by consent no such jurisdiction could be conferred. see the united commercial bank ltd. v. their workmen $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ and $$$ v. gammon india ltd.$$$ / sc/000/$$$ / sc/000/. in hiscox v. outhwaite lloyd 's law reports it is stated:"no act of the parties can create in the courts a jurisdiction which parliament has said shall vest not in the courts but exclusively in some other body. nor again can a party submit to so as to make effective a jurisdiction which does not exist which is perhaps another way of saying the same thing. the argument we are here rejecting seems to be based on a confusion between distinct kinds of jurisdiction the supreme court may by statute lack jurisdiction to deal with a particular matter -in this case matters including superannuation claims under section but it has jurisdiction to decide whether or not it has jurisdiction to deal with such matters. by entering an unconditional appearance a litigant submits to the of these jurisdictions which exists but not to the which does not.. an arbitrator in a situation of this nature had no jurisdiction to pass the interim order under the arbitration act in absence of any specific agreement in relation thereto. the learned arbitrator by an interim order could not have placed the parties to a situation which would travel beyond the subject of disputes and differences referred to the arbitration. as no claim and counter -claim had been filed before the arbitrator the arbitrator was not even aware of the nature of claims of the parties. he neither found any prima facie case nor balance of convenience for passing the said interim order furthermore an arbitrator is bound by the terms of reference. an arbitral tribunal is not a court of law. its orders are not judicial orders. its functions are not judicial functions. it can not exercise its power debito justitiae. the jurisdiction of the arbitrator being confined to the -corners of the agreement he can only pass such an order which may be subject matter of reference. in morgan stanley mutual fund v. kartick das $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ the jurisdiction of the consumer disputes redressal forum to pass an order of injunction came up for consideration. this court having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein formulated the following questions:"( whether the prospective investor could be a consumer within the meaning of consumer protection act whether the appellant company trades in shares does the consumer disputes redressal forum have jurisdiction in matters of this kind?( what are the guiding principles in relating to the grant of an ad interim injunction in such areas of the functioning of the capital market and public issues of the corporate sectors and whether certain venue restriction clauses would require to be evolved judicially as has been d in cases such as state of w. b. v. swapan kumar guha and sanchaita investments $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ what is the scope of section of the act?". this court held that a prospective investor like the respondent therein is not a consumer. the question of the appellant -company trading in shares does not arise and in that view of the matter the consumer disputes redressal forum has no jurisdiction whatsoever to pass an order of interim injunction. having regard to section of the consumer protection act it was held:" a careful reading of the above discloses that there is no power under the act to grant any interim relief of sic or even an ad interim relief. only a final relief could be granted if the jurisdiction of the forum to grant relief is confined to the clauses mentid under section it passes our comprehension as to how an interim injunction could ever be granted disregarding even the balance of convenience. in absence of an agreement to the contrary in terms of the provisions of arbitration act an arbitrator can pass only an interim award or a final award. such awards are enforceable in law. the award of an arbitrator whether interim or final are capable of being made a rule of court decree prepared and drawn up in terms thereof and put to execution. it is well -settled that for the purpose of obtaining an interim order a party to the arbitration proceeding during pendency of an arbitral proceeding can only approach a court of law in terms of section of the arbitration act and not otherwise. the said provision reads . procedure and powers of court.to the provisions of this act of rules made thereunder x(b the court shall have for the purpose of and in relation to arbitration proceedings the same power of making orders in respect of any of the matters set out in the schedule as it has for the purpose of and in relation to any proceedings before the court provided that nothing in clause b shall be taken to prejudice any power which may be vested in an arbitrator or umpire for making orders with respect to any of such matters. in the instant case the proviso has no application as the arbitrator was not vested with such power. jurisdiction of courts in terms of section of the act is enumerated in the schedule rules and whereof are as under:". the preservation interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject -matter of the reference. $$$ injunctions or the appointment of a receiver. even the court 's jurisdiction under section of the act is limited as it is confined to for the purpose of and in relation to arbitration proceedings. courts thus have also no power to grant injunction debito justitiae. see union of india v. raman iron foundry $$$ / sc/000/$$$ / sc/000/ and h.m. $$$ and co. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/000/$$$ / sc/000/. we may observe that even provision for stay in a suit under section c.p.c. is not applicable in relation to an arbitration proceeding. in indrajit sinha v. b.l. $$$ / wb/00/$$$ / wb/00/ aircal it is stated:"when section arbitration act completely prohibits a civil court from deciding the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement and section arbitration act lays down that the civil procedure code will apply subject to the provisions and rules of the arbitration act then section c.p.c.can not apply on the facts and circumstances of this case and the question of its applicability can not arise.so far as court 's inherent jurisdiction under section c.p.c. is concerned i do not think that on the facts and circumstances of this case inherent jurisdiction can be exercised to stay the pending application in view of the fact that the city civil court is incompetent to decide the issues pending before me in the application under section of the act. in debendra nath singha and ors. v. dwijendra nath singha and ors. reported in $$$ / $$$ / wb/0/ aircal the law is stated in the following terms on a proper construction of section of the arbitration act and of section in particular i am of the opinion that the court has the power and jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or to make any order of interim injunction or to make orders in respect of other matters set out in the second schedule in appropriate cases for the purpose of and in relation to arbitration proceedings but this power and jurisdiction of the court can not be exercised if the exercise of any such power would prejudice any power which might be vested in an arbitrator or umpire for making orders with respect to any of such matters. i am further of the opinion that in view of the provisions contained in section of the arbitration act the power and jurisdiction of the court to appoint a receiver or to make any order of interim injunction or any order in respect of the other matters set out in the second schedule are now governed controlled and regulated by the said section and apart from the power and jurisdiction conferred by the said section the court has no power and jurisdiction independently of the provisions contained in the said section to appoint a receiver to make any order of interim injunction or any order in respect of the other matters set out in the second schedule. it is useful to notice that such a power has been expressly conferred on the arbitrator in terms of section of the arbitration and conciliation act which is as under:". $$$ measures ordered by arbitral tribunal.. unless otherwise agreed by the parties the arbitral tribunal may at the request of a party order a party to take any interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject -matter of the dispute.the arbitral tribunal may require a party to provide appropriate security in connection with a measure ordered under sub -section. a bare perusal of the aforementid provisions would clearly show that even under section of the act the power of the arbitrator is a limited. it can not issue any direction which would go beyond the reference or the arbitration agreement. furthermore an award of the arbitrator under the act is not required to be made a rule of court the same is enforceable on its own force. even under section of act an interim order must relate to the protection of subject matter of dispute and the order may be addressed only to a party to the arbitration. it can not be addressed to other parties. even under section of the act no power is conferred upon the arbitral tribunal to enforce its order nor does it provide for judicial enforcement thereof. the said interim order of the learned arbitrator therefore being coram non judice was wholly without jurisdiction and thus a nullity. see $$$ and ors. v. chaman paswan and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ srimathi kaushalya devi

u.p. avas evam vikas parishad and ors. $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0 air0scwhether the award is vitiated as general conditions of contract had not seen complied with?0. before the learned arbitrators a question was raised as regard applicability of clauses and of the general conditions of contract which read as follows:"determination. the organization may without prejudice to any other right or remedy which shall have accrued or shall accrue thereafter to the organization cancel the contract in part or whole in any of the following cases if $$$ x x x(c)x x x(d)x x x(e in the opinion of the organisation architect at any time whether before or after the date or extended date for completion makes defaults in proceeding with the work with due diligence and continues in that state after reasonable notice from the architect and or organisation or(f)x x x(g)x x x". whenever the organisation exercises his authority to cancel the contract under clause he may complete the works by any means at the contractor 's risk and expense provided always that in event of cost of completion after alternative arrangements have been finalized by the organisation to get the works completed or estimated cost of completion as certified by the architect and approved by organisation being less than the contract cost the advantage shall accrue to the organisation. if the cost of completion after the alternative arrangements have been finalised by the organisation to get the work completed or estimated cost of completion as certified by the architect.and approved by the organisation exceeds the my due to the contractor under this contract the contractor shall either pay the excess amount assessed by the architect or the same shall be recovered from the contractor by other means. the learned arbitrators refused to enter into the questions as to whether the awho had made out a case for canceling the contract and invoking the risk and expense clause stating we do not consider it necessary to go into the question whether clause requires certificate by the architect in case completion of the work is d at the risk and expense as urged by sspl or only where the alternative arrangements for completion of the work have not been finalised and estimated cost of completion is to be considered as submitted by awho. in our opinion clause deals with a situation where awho completes or decides to complete the work on their own and has no application where the completion of the work is being permitted under an order passed in a judicial / arbitral proceeding. the certification by the architect is intended as a check against an arbitrary claim towards cost of completion. such a check is not required when the completion of the work is d in pursuance of an order in a judicial / arbitral proceeding because the court / arbitral tribunal would examine any such grievance of the other party. since in the present matter awho were allowed to complete the work under the order of the sole arbitrator dated november which contained appropriate directions regarding the manner in which the contract shall be given the certification of the architect contemplated by clause was not required. the approach to the question by the learned arbitrators was wholly errous. an award made pursuant to an order which has been passed without jurisdiction necessarily must be held to be a nullity. $$$ on the part of the learned arbitrator to consider the effect of clause of the agreement would amount to a legal misconduct. having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case as would be discussed in details hereinafter it was incumbent on the part of the arbitrators to apply due diligence clause contained in clause. more cautiously. they were further required to consider as to whether due diligence clause be applied where the alleged violation of contract was only in relation to a small part thereof. the learned arbitrators were in law bound to consider the relevant provisions of the contract and in particular those which deal with the rights and liabilities of the parties. this aspect of the matter has not been taken into consideration by the learned arbitrators while making the award. thus they failed to take into consideration a relevant fact. in steel authority of india ltd. supra this court categorically stated the law thus:"it was not open to the arbitrator to ignore the said conditions which are binding on the contracting parties. by ignoring the same he has acted beyond the jurisdiction conferred upon him. it is settled law that the arbitrator derives the authority from the contract and if he acts in manifest disregard of the contract the award given by him would be are arbitrary. this deliberate departure from the contract amounts not only to manifest disregard of the authority or misconduct on his part but it may tantamount to mala fide action.it was stated""further the arbitration act does not give any power to the arbitrator to act arbitrarily or capriciously. his existence depends upon the agreement and his function is to act within the limits of the said agreement. in continental construction co. ltd. v. state of m.p. $$$ / sc//$$$ / sc// this court considered the clauses of the contract which stipulated that the contractor had to complete the work in spite of rise in the prices of materials and also rise in labour charges at the rates stipulated in the contract.it is to be reiterated that to find out whether the arbitrator has travel led beyond his jurisdiction and acted beyond the terms of the agreement between the parties the agreement is required to be looked into. it is true that interpretation of a particular condition in the agreement would be within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. however in cases where there is no question of interpretation of any term of the contract but of solely reading the same as it is and still the arbitrator ignores it and awards the amount despite the prohibition in the agreement the award would be arbitrary capricious and without jurisdiction. whether the arbitrator has acted beyond the terms of the contract or has travelled beyond his jurisdiction would depend upon facts which however would be jurisdictional facts and are required to be g into by the court. the arbitrator may have jurisdiction to entertain claim and yet he may not have jurisdiction to pass award for particular items in view of the prohibition contained in the contract and in such cases it would be a jurisdictional error. for this limited purpose reference to the terms of the contract is a must.emphasis supplied). in shyama charan agarwala supra this court referred to the said decision. a bench of this court recently in bharat coking coal ltd. v. annapurna construction$$$ / sc//0$$$ / sc//0 air0sc0 upon referring to a large number of decisions question is as to whether the claim of the contractor is d'hors the terms or not was a matter which fell for consideration before the arbitrator. he was bound to consider the same. the jurisdiction of the arbitrator in such a matter must be held to be confined to the -corners of the contract. he could not have ignored an important clause in the agreement although it may be open to the arbitrator to arrive at a finding on the materials on records that the claimant 's claim for additional work was otherwise justified. as regard the duty of the arbitrator to take into consideration the relevant provisions contained in the agreement it was observed:"so far as these items are concerned in our opinion the learned sole arbitrator should have taken into consideration the relevant provisions contained in the agreement as also the correspondences passed between the parties. the question as to whether the work could not be completed within $$$$ months or the extension was sought for on condition or the other was justifiable or not which are relevant facts and were required to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator.it is now well settled that the arbitrator can not act arbitrarily irrationally capriciously or independent of the contract,". this court further opined;"there lies a clear distinction between an error within the jurisdiction and error in excess of jurisdiction. thus the role of the arbitrator is to arbitrate within the terms of the contract. he has no power apart from what the parties have given him under the contract. if he has travelled beyond the contract he would be acting without jurisdiction whereas if he has remained inside the parameter of the contract his award can not be questid on the ground that it contains an error apparent on the face of the records. referring to paragraph of halsbury 's laws of england edition commercial arbitration by must

on a different footing namely that the arbitrator while passing the award in relation to some items failed and/or neglected to take into consideration the relevant clauses of the contract nor did he take into consideration the relevant materials for the purpose of arriving at a correct sic finding of fact such an order would amount to misdirection in law. before the learned arbitrators a question arose as to whether certification of architect as regard estimated cost of completion was a condition precedent for determination of the quantum of damages. construction of clauses and having regard to the fact situation obtaining herein was mandatorily required to be considered by the learned arbitrators. they could not have been simply ignored the same on the premise that an interim order has been passed by the arbitrator. an arbitrator can not be equated with a court of law whereas court has an inherent power an arbitrator does not have. it is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction. its jurisdiction is circumscribed by the terms and reference. an arbitrator can act only within the corners of the agreement and not beyond thereto. yet again this court in union of india v. v. $$$ and sons and anr. $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0 air0sc0 dealt in details about an award which was found to be inconsistent question as to whether party or the other was responsible for delay in causing completion of the contract job thus squarely fell for consideration before the arbitrator. the arbitrator could not have arrived at a finding that both committed breaches of the terms of contract which was facie unsustainable being wholly inconsistent. clause of the contract could be invoked only when the respondent committed breach of the terms of the contract. an action in terms thereof could be taken recourse to in its entirety or not at all. if part of the award is inconsistent with the other and furthermore if in determining the disputes between the parties the arbitrator failed to take into consideration the relevant facts or based his decision on irrelevant factors not germane therefor the arbitrator must be held to have committed a legal -misconduct. this court made a distinction between an award passed within jurisdiction and an award without jurisdiction stating:"in this case the district judge as also the high court of madras clearly held that the award can not be sustained having regard to the inherent inconsistency contained therein. the arbitrator as has been correctly held by the district judge and the high court committed a legal misconduct in arriving at an inconsistent finding as regard breach of the contract on the part of party or the other. once the arbitrator had granted damages to the respondent which could be granted only on a finding that the appellant had committed breach of the terms of contract and thus was responsible therefore any finding contrary thereto and inconsistent therewith while awarding any sum in favour of the appellant would be wholly unsustainable being self contradictory. this court can not sit in appeal over the award of the arbitrator but can certainly interfere when the award suffers from non -application of mind or when relevant fact is ignored or irrelevant fact not germane for deciding the dispute is taken into consideration. where an order has been passed without jurisdiction the principles of estoppel waiver and acquiescence will have no application. there is no estoppel against statute. the award therefore suffers from legal misconduct on the part of the arbitrators.role of an architect:. an architect plays an important role in execution of a building contract. in hudson 's building and engineering contracts at page it is stated:"an architect is a person who professes skill in the art of designing buildings to meet his client 's need in the organization of the contractual arrangements for their construction and in the supervision of work and contractual administration until final completion. so a major part of an architect 's activities will be concerned with the preparation of contracts the obtaining and recommending for acceptance of estimates from builders the selection of specialist contractors the inspection of work carried out the solution of difficulties encountered during the course of erecting the building condemning and dealing with defective work the issue of certificates under the terms of the contract and advising or ruling on disputes between the owner and the contractor. thus it will be seen that although it is the primary and vital function of the architect to create new ideas of amenity and design and to set down those ideas on a drawing -board his duties extend far into other fields of technical knowledge and business management. on the other hand while he will remain primarily responsible to the owner for all matters of design modern techniques of construction and specialized building products and processes in fact demand expertise and skill for which he will inevitably not always be personally qualified. the employment of outside consultants or the less satisfactory from the legal point of view if the employer 's interest is to be properly protected device of delegating important design functions to specialist and sub -contractors and suppliers are therefore a frequent and inevitable accompaniment of many major building projects but as will be seen the architect is the captain of the ship and will be the person to whom the owner will normally look if a design failure occurs though in some but not all cases he will adequately discharge his own overall responsibility if he exercises due professional care in referring matters outside his own expertise to a consultant or specialist supplier or contractor particularly if these latter are engaged on behalf of the owner and not by the architect himself. an architect has thus various roles to play including independently ruling on disputes between the owner and the contractor. in r. v. architects ' registration tribunal. p. jaggar all er it is stated:"an architect is who possesses with due regard to aesthetic as well as practical consideration adequate skill and knowledge to enable him i to originate to design and plan iii to arrange for and supervise the erection of such buildings or other works calling for skill in design and planning as he might in the course of his business reasonably be asked to carry out or in respect of which he offers his services as a specialist. an architect has a great role to play in making an estimate. he is expected to neither under -estimate nor can over -estimate value of the works he is bound by his conduct to the owner. he can be sued for his negligence. for his misconduct fees payable to him may be forfeited. he may incur other liabilities not only under the contract but also under statute. clause of the contract casts a burden upon an architect to estimate the damages when a risk and cost -clause is invoked against the contractor. it is possible to hold that the invocation of arbitration clause would be subject to exercise of the jurisdiction by the architect as a demand has to be made upon the contractor depending on such estimate made by the architect. in a given case having regard to the reasonableness of the estimated amount a contractor may pay the same or challenge the same either by an arbitrator or by a court of law. a dispute may fall for adjudication by an arbitrator or by a court of law only in the event a contractor refuses to accept such estimate. in g.t. gajria 's $$$ and engineering contracts in india fourth edition at page it is stated:"in a contract where there is certificate clause which is a condition precedent to payment and an arbitration clause of person other than the architect the builder can not recover without the certificate and neither the arbitrator nor the court apart always from some misconduct of the architect has jurisdiction to consider any matters. in respect of which the certificate of the architect by the terms of the contract is made a condition precedent. an architect sometimes is appointed as an arbitrator and no payment can be made except on his certificate and sometimes his position is that of a person whose certificate is held to be a condition precedent for invoking the arbitration clause see bristol corporation v. john aird & co. all e.r. rep. hickman and co. v. $$$ all e.r. rep. and south india rly. co. ltd. v. s.m. $$$ air mad.. these decisions were considered by a division bench of the madhya pradesh high court in heavy electricals india ltd. bhopal v. pannalal davchand malviya $$$ / mp/000/$$$ / mp/000/ airmp. in this view of the matter we are of the opinion that the arbitrator could not have ignored the role of the architect in terms of clause of the agreement only on the ground that awho had been permitted to raise construction pursuant to or in furtherance of an interim order. non -consideration of the said clause in proper perspective by the arbitrator would amount to a legal misconduct on their part.whose duty it was to get the plan sanctioned:. m / s. dulal mukherjee & associates had been the architect of $$$. by reason of the agreement however he became an architect of the employer. it was in the aforementid situation the following was agreed between the parties and the same was recorded in the contract agreement as under:". company informed that they have negotiated with m / s dulal mukherjee & associates -$$$ $$$ as architects for providing all architectural services for this turn key project. as per the understanding of the company with the architect the company has to pay to the architect at the firm rate of rs. per sq. ft. of built -up area excluding stilt area for the turn key project. the stilt area is not to be taken into account while calculating the amount of fee payable to the architect. architect fee for all internal services development of land all external services and stilt area is deemed to be included in the rates of rs.per sq. ft. for built up area. it is hereby mutually agreed and accepted that the services of the architect m / s dulal mukherjee & associates with immediate effect shall be controlled by the organisation and the payments due to the architects will be made by the organisation direct. for making this payment an amount calculated at rs.per sq. ft. of built up area as per para above shall not be released by the organisation to the company. the payments due to the architect for his architectural services shall be released by the organisation in terms of separate agreement entered by the organisation with m / s dulal mukherjee & associates the architects. for the architectural services rendered by the architect upto the signing of this agreement the company is fully responsible for any omissions and commissions. for all architectural services after the signing of this agreement the organisation will take the responsibility. the company has paid a sum of rs.lacs as adhoc advance to the architect. this amount shall be reimbursed by the organisation to the company and shall be adjusted against the total amount payable to the architects by the organisation. architectural services have not been defined in the agreement. however in a letter dated.issued by awho to m / s. dulal mukherjee & associates it was mentid that obtaining and getting preparation of municipal drawings and obtaining sanctions was the architect 's responsibility stating:". please refer to your letter of $$$ following the detailed discussions on the project held on & $$$ at this hq. as per understanding arrived at between awho and m / s. $$$ services pvt. ltd. your employment and payment will be

monitor the progress on behalf of awho. you will also forward a $$$$ report on the same. the contract documents between you and awho is under drafting and would come in effect when ready. please acknowledge. despite the fact by reason of the contract agreement the services of the architect were placed solely at the disposal of awho it purported to have entered into another agreement wherein $$$ was not a party on or about 4th february wherein the responsibility of the architect was defined as under:". architects responsibilities. $$$cept to the extent otherwise stipulated in this agreement the responsibility and services of the architect shall include the responsibilities and obligations of architects as laid down by the indian institute of architects except net liability and net schedule of payments and will particularly include the following obligations of the architect preparation of drawings for submission to civil agencies excluding obtaining sanctions which will be d by builder / contractor but should guide the builder / contractor but should guide the builder / contractor in obtaining the same. legally the said agreement was not binding on $$$ as it was not a

contractual obligation for the purpose of attracting the penal clauses must appear from the contract itself and not from any other document. the learned arbitrators in their award did not point out any specific clause in terms whereof it was for $$$ to get the plan sanctid. it merely relying or on the basis of a letter of $$$ made it partially liable therefore. no document exists to show that $$$ had any legal liability to get the municipal plan sanctid. section of the west bengal municipal act prohibits erection of any building excepting with the previous sanction of the board of councillors. in terms of section it is for the person who intends to erect or re -erect a building to submit an application with a building plan in such form. the provisions of the west bengal municipal act go to show that it was for awho to submit an application for sanction of the building plan together with requisite documents therefore. ordinarily the duty to pursue sanction of a plan is of the owner or its authorised representative. such a job it is common experience is d by a qualified architect or the persons having regard to their duties to prepare a building plan in terms of the building laws so as to enable them to make clarifications as and when called upon by the statutory authorities or in a given case make modifications or alterations thereof the building plans prepared by the architects only would be subject -matter of sanction by the municipal authorities. furthermore from the letter dated.also it is evident that awho prayed for alterations of the master plan and in the said letter it has clearly been stated that m / s dulal mukherjee & associates had been appointed by them as consulting architect for the project. from a perusal of the letter dated.issued by the $$$ to $$$ project manager awho it would appear that the author thereof had discussed the matter with $$$ as also with m / s dulal mukherjee & associates and only with them views were exchanged as regard the norms of municipal rules and regulations. from the letter dated.issued by awho to $$$ it appears that shri manohar singh its project manager along with representatives of m / s dulal mukherjee & associates had a detailed meeting with chairman $$$ wherein it was agreed that the work need not be stepped for which its plans had already been approved. the alleged responsibility of $$$ to get the plan sanctid has been raised only in july -august i. after the dispute between the parties started. the municipality made awho responsible for coordination and construction activities. the stop work notice was served upon awho. awho in its letter as noticed hereinbefore categorically stated that its representative with the authorised representative of the architect saw the chairman in. awho and not $$$ made other correspondences with the municipality. if $$$ was assisting them in getting the plan passed it in law did not incur any liability therefore the findings of the learned arbitrators therefore do not borne out from the records and are perverse. it will amount to giving of premium to illegality if it be held that a party can ignore statutory injunction on the specious plea that the same is minor in nature and maybe validated by the statutory authorities in future. neither any party can undertake any construction activity on the pains of facing criminal charge nor any court of law / arbitral tribunal encourage such violation either directly or indirectly. furthermore risk and cost clause can not be invoked on failure of the party to respond to its self -imposed obligation. $$$ are to be paid for willful breach of the terms or conditions of the contract. such a breach must be in relation to an express agreement entered into by and between the parties. an alleged breach on the part of a builder can not be founded on a mere ipse dixit. the learned arbitrators in their award purported to have held..that sspl had a role in getting the plans sanctid by the competent authority is borne out by letter of awho to sspl dated october $$$.e-45 awho. vol.p.and the reply of sspl dated december $$$.e- awho. vol. p.to the said letter of awho. in the said letter of awho dated october. it was stated. $$$ of building plan and revised lay out plan. sanction of building plan and revised lay out plans has already been considerably delayed. this is effecting the progress of the work also. though dma is taking action but the follow up action as a part of the turnkey project is to be taken by you. please ensure that the sanction is obtained further delay.awho vol.p. para sspl in their reply dated december. said sanctioning of building plan -you have been informed during several discussions in your office in new delhi that there had been structural change in the local authority system affecting the project area. for some considerable period vacuum existed in many standard local govt. functions. however the new municipality authority has recently been formed. we are following up with the new authority in respect of the sanctioning process.awho vol. p. the letter dated.referred to in the award clearly shows that the architect was asked to take action but allegedly the follow up action was to be taken by sumangal only on the ground that the project was a turnkey. sumangal 's letter dated.merely stated that there had been structural change in the local authority system affecting the project area and there had been some vacuum in many standard local government functions and that they had been following up with the new authority in respect of the sanctioning process. presumably in the aforementid backdrop the learned arbitrators observed we are therefore unable to hold that the entire responsibility for obtaining sanction for the plans from the competent authority had been transferred from sspl to awho after june and thereafter awho and dma were responsible for obtaining the said sanction. thus merely some role had been attributed to sumangal in the matter of getting the plan sanctid and not a breach of contract leading to incurring its liability under clause of the agreement.effect of such agreement assuming there was one03. there can not be an agreement that somebody would be bound to obtain a statutory order from the statutory authorities as thereover he would have no control. in the law lexicon the maxim ' $$$ turpi causa non orator actio is defined a bad illegal consideration on action can arise. as regard the question as to whether such a contract in its entirety or to some extent would be illegal or not which would give rise to further question as regard its enforceability we may notice the following passage from $$$ and ors. v. $$$ $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/005/96$$$ / sc/005/96 reported decisions bearing on this question show that consideration of this problem often gives rise to what may be described as a battle of legal maxims the appellants emphasised that the doctrine which is pre -eminently applicable to the present case is dolo malo non orator actio or turpi cause non orator actio. in other words they contended that the right of action can not arise out of fraud or out of transgression of law and according to them it is necessary in such a case that possession should rest where it lies in pari delicto potior est conditio possidenties where each party is equally in fraud the law favours him who is actually in possession or where both parties are equally guilty the estate will lie where it falls. on the other hand respondent argues that the proper maxim to apply is nemo a llegans seam turpitudinum audiendum est whoever has to plead turpitudinum should fail that party fails who has to allege fraud in which he participated. in other words the principle invoked by respondent is that a man can not plead his own fraud. in deciding the question as to which maxim should govern the present case it is necessary to recall what lord $$$ m.r. observed about these maxims in $$$ v. sadler and moore k. b. referring to the maxim turpi causa non orator actio lord $$$ observed that this maxim though veiled in the dignity of learned language is a statement of a principle of great importance but like most maxims it is much too vague and much too general to admit of application without a careful consideration of the circumstances and of the various definite rules which have been laid down by the authorities. in kuju collieries ltd. v. jharknand mines ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/0030/974$$$ / sc/0030/974 this court held that in relation to a contract which is hit by section of the contract act section and section of the contract act shall not apply. only in a case where a contract has become void due to subsequent happenings the advantage gained by a person should be restored. the building plans would be sanctid provided the same are in accordance with the statutory building rules. if admittedly the plans as also the constructions were not in terms of rules question of getting them sanctid by a statutory authority would not arise. such a contract it is reiterated would be illegal. principle of estoppel will have not application in relation thereto as that part of the agreement itself would not be enforceable. in the event however the builder was merely required to take follow -up action in the matter with the authorities the contract may be valid but in that event it must not only be pleaded and proved that there existed an agreement in that behalf but also to how and to what extent the builder failed to perform its part of the contract. the findings of the learned arbitrators are without any materials and without applying the correct legal principles and thus the same can not be sustained. admittedly the deviations which were minor s were regularized only on 3rd april. the contract however stood terminated on 7th october. even in the ordinary course sumangal could not have carried out any construction activities in anticipation that such deviations might be regularized. whether such deviations would be regularized in respect of phase i or whether building plans for phase ii and phase iii would be sanctid and if so within what time could only be a matter of speculation but the same would be irrelevant for determining the liabilities of the parties which was required to be guided by commercial considerations. the liability to pay damages must arise out of contract and not otherwise. the award does not specifically say of contract section of the indian contract act reads to do impossible act:- an agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful a contract to do an act which after the contract is made becomes impossible or by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent unlawful becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.compensation for loss through non -performance of act known to be impossible or unlawful:-- where person has promised to do something which he knew or with reasonable diligence might have known and which the promise did not know to be impossible or unlawful such promisor must make compensation to such promise for any loss which such promise sustains through the non -performance of the promise. impossibility to fulfill the contractual obligation may arise in different fact situations. statutory injunction by a statutory authority may be of such causes. a building bye -law must be scrupulously followed. violation of section of the west bengal municipal act attracts penal provisions contained in section. it is therefore mandatory in nature. the correspondences between awho and the municipality clearly show that even infrastructure works were not permitted to be carried out. sumangal therefore can not be said to have committed any illegality in complying with the stop work notice to what extent it committed breach of the terms of the contract assuming that it could have carried out some job as pointed out by awho would depend upon the commercial viability as a large number of workmen were to be engaged although it can not carry out the major construction work which was a relevant factor for determining the quantum of damages. sumangal might have been partially liable but it can not be faulted when it refused to carry out any constructional work in violation of the stop work notice which would attract the penal provisions of section of the west bengal municipal act. the learned arbitrators were also bound to take into consideration this aspect of the matter. they failed to do so and misdirected themselves in law. in an interesting article titled the principle of impossibility in contract by h.w.r. wade published in law quarterly review volume page it is points emerge from the argument so far i there can exist no duty to do an impossible act. ii a promise is normally and primarily a promise of performance simply and not of damages in the alternative. the effect of supervening impossibility on an existing duty can now be determined and in view of conclusion i the answer is a simple. it must be that the impossibility causes the duty to cease to exist. for a duty either exists or it does not -that is to say every duty continues until it is discharged and discharge is the only process known to the law by which a duty once legally undertaken can be put off the shoulders of the obligee. its effect is a complete removal of the obligation and discharge by impossibility of performance is no less perfect than discharge by the performance of the original promise. in the words of professor $$$ already cited society no longer commands performance -nothing more can be demanded of the promisor. in emden and $$$ 's buildings contracts and practice seventh edition page -it is stated that liability to pay damages for non -performance of an impossibility only arises where the contract is absolute and unrestricted by any condition expressed or implied. it is further stated that a difficulty may not in all circumstances amount to impossibility. but even in that event the terms and conditions relating to performance of the contract may stand eclipsed. the transaction was a commercial . sumangal could not plead frustration of contract if it itself had abandd it. see hauman v. $$$ a.d. and hoenig v. issacs all e.r.. it is well -settled that a builder renouncing his obligations could not claim substantial performance. in hudson 's building and engineering contracts at page the law is stated as:"a further overriding principle to be deduced from the cases it is submitted is that a party consciously in breach a fortiori a party repudiating an obligation or abandoning work should not be enabled to abuse the doctrine by maintaining that position while at the same time suing for remuneration under the contract. thus in south africa there is long -standing authority that substantial performance is not available where work is abandd or the method of performance is inconsistent with an hst intention to carry out the work in accordance with the contract. sumpter v. $$$ and $$$ v. $$$ were clear cases of abandonment. such a case of abandonment was not made out. what was made out was a case of self -inducement frustration. we repeatedly asked mr. $$$ to show before us any pleading as regard self -induced frustration on the part of sumangal. he failed to do so. no material far less any pleading has also been placed before us to show that there had been collusion by and between sumangal and municipal authorities in getting the work stopped. there exists a presumption as regard the official transactions having been d in regular course of business. the onus of proving that plea of frustration was self -induced is on the party who alleges that this is the case. see $$$ steamship line ltd. v. imperial smelting corporation ltd. a.c. in treitel 's law of contract seventh edition at page it is stated:"the onus of proving that frustration is self -induced is on the party who alleges that this is the case. in $$$ ss line v. imperial smelting corp. ltd. ac a ship was disabled by an explosion from performing her obligations under a charter party. the owners were sued for damages and pleaded that the explosion frustrated the charter party. the charters argued that the owners must prove that the explosion was not due to their fault but the house of lords rejected this argument and upheld the defence of frustration although the cause of the explosion was never explained. the rule is open to the objection that the charterer is much less likely than the owner to be able to show how the explosion occurred. this reasoning does indeed prevail in group of cases a person to whom goods have been bailed and who seeks to rely on their destruction as a ground of frustration of the contract of bailment must show that the destruction was not due to any breach of his duty as a bailee. but this special situation excepted the rule as to burden of proof laid down in the $$$ case can be defended on the ground that generally catastrophic events which prevent performance do occur without the fault of either party. to impose the burden of disproving fault on the party relying on frustration is therefore less likely than the converse rule to lead to the right result in the majority of cases. it is interesting to note that at page of the said treatise the learned author states:"the further question arises whether a contract can be frustrated by an event brought about by the negligent act of of the parties. lord $$$ has put the case of a prima donna who lost her voice through carelessly catching cold. he seemed to incline to the view that she could plead frustration so long as the incapacity was not deliberately induced in order to get out of the engagement.this particular result can perhaps be justified by the difficulty of foreseeing the effect of conduct on 's health. but it is submitted that generally negligence should exclude frustration for example the plea should have failed in $$$ v. $$$ if the fire had been due to the negligence of the defendants. in such a case it would be unjust to make the other party bear the loss. a negligent omission should likewise exclude frustration. in cheshire fifoot & furmston 's law of contract edition at page the law is stated thus:"this rule that a party can not claim to be discharged by a frustrating event for which he is himself responsible does not require him to prove affirmatively that the event occurred without his fault. the onus of proving that the frustration was self -induced rests upon the party raising this allegation. for instance on $$$$ a chartered ship was due to load her cargo an explosion of such violence occurred in her auxiliary boiler that the performance of the charter -party became impossible. the cause of the explosion could not be definitely ascertained but only of possible reasons would have imputed negligence to the shipowners.it was held by the house of lords that since the charterers were unable to prove that the explosion was caused by the fault of the owners the defence of frustration succeeded and the contract was discharged. it should perhaps be rioted that in many cases a self -induced frustrating event will be a breach of contract but this will not necessarily be so. in maritime national fish ltd. v. ocean trawlers ltd ac the applicants were not contractually bound to licence the chartered trawler but could not excuse failure to pay hire by relying on the absence of a licence. even no case of negligence on the part of sumangal made out. the burden of proof in relation to all these pleas thus was on awho. it failed to discharge the same.quantum of damages:5. it is not necessary for us to go into the question of quantum of damages in details but we may observe that the learned arbitrators proceeded on a wrong premise even in relation thereto. it took into consideration the subsequent events. purported subsequent conduct on the part of sumangal became the bed -rock of the findings against it by the learned arbitrators. the disputes and differences between the parties were required to be determined as on.. conduct of the parties subsequent thereto was wholly irrelevant. thus there exists an error apparent on the face of the award. liability to pay damages would indisputably arise only in the event a breach of contract has taken place. clause of the general conditions of the contract could be invoked only in the event of breach on the part of sumangal and if awho could in law take recourse to clause of the contract. for the purpose of invoking clause of the general conditions of contract it was incumbent upon the learned arbitrators to arrive at a specific finding that a breach of the terms of condition has been committed by sumangal. such breach must be in relation to a term of the contract between the parties. if a breach has occurred in respect of an agreement to which sumangal is not a party clause could not have been invoked. the law relating to damages in this behalf is stated in $$$ edition at paras and in the following terms the normal measure of damages is the cost to the owner of completing the building in a reasonable manner less the contract price and possibly in addition the value of the use of the premises lost by reason of the delay this measure of cost of completion less contract price is laid down by the court of appeal in mertens v. home freeholds co.k.b. ca.which must be regarded perforce as the leading case since it proves to be the only dealing with this issue. the defendant contracted to build a house for the plaintiff and was to begin work immediately after possession of the site was given to him. the defendant worked well for $$$$ but then deliberately failed to proceed with due dispatch in the knowledge that a government embargo on building without licence was to be imposed. had he worked according to contract the roof could have been on to the house before the embargo descended. or years later the plaintiff completed the work himself when building was again permitted but when costs had risen. it was held that the proper measure of damages was the cost to the plaintiff of completion in a reasonable manner at the earliest moment that he was allowed to proceed with building less the amount he would have had to pay the defendant had the defendant completed the house as far as the roofing -in at the time agreed by the terms of the contract. the court of appeal reversed the divisional court which had taken for its basic figure not the cost of completion but the market value that the completed building would have had at the contractual time due for completion. of this lord sterndale m.r. said they the divisional court have treated the contract as if it were for the sale of goods and have held that the measure of damages is the difference between the market price of $$$$ of what the plaintiff ought to have had and what he got. in my humble opinion that is an entirely wrong way of looking at the contract there is no contract to deliver goods and there is no market price for a roofed house.mertens v. home freeholds co. k.b. is also authority for taking the cost of completion as at the time when it became once again legal to build although between breach and the removal of the government embargo on building or years afterwards costs had risen substantially. and conversely as younger l.j. pointed out if the cost of building had decreased in that time the damages would have been correspondingly diminished. this rule is however subject to the general principles of mitigation so that in the words of lord sterndale.the building owner must set to work to build his house at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.and is not entitled to delay for $$$$ and then if prices have g up charge the defaulting builder with the increased price. we may however notice that in $$$ and anr. v. woor w.l.r. and east ham borough corporation v. bernard sunley & sons ltd. ac law almost to the similar effect has been laid down. in hudson 's building and engineering contracts at page -it is stated:"builders constructed a school with serious defects in fixing the st facing. the contract was in the riba standard form. $$$$ after the final certificate a st fell and the owners discovered the defects. the arbitrator found that the defects could have been but in fact were not discovered or noticed by the architect during the course of his normal supervision of the work. at the date of the breach which the parties agreed should for purposes of convenience be treated as the date of completing the work the cost of repair would have been considerably less due to rising prices than it was when the owners finally discovered the defects. $$$ by $$$ ford stevenson j.distinguishing phillips v. ward w.l.r. that since the owners had been guilty of no unreasonable delay once they discovered the defects they were entitled to the greater cost of the repairs at the time they carried them out. $$$ by the house of lords affirming the judge that the parties must have contemplated that the architect might fail to notice defective work. the cost of repair at the date of discovering the breach was on the cards or a loss liable to result from the breach within the test formulated by $$$.j. in the $$$ case. per lord upjohn where the cost of reinstatement is the proper measure of damages it necessarily follows as a matter of common sense that in the ordinary case the cost must be assessed at the time when the defect is discovered and put right and it is not suggested here that the building owner unreasonably delayed the work of repair after discovery of the defect..i am at a loss to understand why the negligent builder should be able to limit his liability by reason of the fact that at some earlier stage the architect failed to notice some defective work..east ham borough council v. $$$.a.c.. reference may also be made to illustrations given in hudson 's building and engineering contracts at pages --. in emden and $$$ 's buildings contracts and practice seventh edition at page the law is stated thus the measure of damages for failure by the contractor to complete a building or engineering contract will include the difference if any between the price of the work as agreed upon in the contract and the cost the employer is actually put to in its completion i and cost of completion means cost of the completion of the contract work itself.illustrationa builder agreed in may to build a house for plaintiff for a lump sum complete within a specified time. after starting the work the builder intentionally delayed progress for the purpose of ensuring that the ministry of munitions should refuse a licence for construction of the house under defence of the realm regulations and that he would thereby as he thought be released from the contract. the licence was refused and the work had to be entirely suspended till when plaintiff completed the building. -held the builder could not take advantage of a prevention brought about by his own act and the proper measure of damages was what it cost the plaintiff to complete the house as soon as the statutory restriction ceased less any amount which have been due and payable to the builder if he had proceeded with due diligence up to the date when the licence was refused.in a leading case the house of lords has held that the proper measure of damages is the cost of re -instatement such cost must be assessed at the time when the defects are discovered and are put right. sumangal thus could have been found liable for drawings if inter alia it was guilty of or the other misconducts as referred to hereinbefore.title in respect of.acres of land:35. claim no. related to title of.acres of land. sumangal entered into an agreement on a turn -key basis. the contention of sumangal is that the lands were transferred in the name of awho by way of security. this may or may not be so. but herein we are only concerned with the question as to whether the award can be set aside or not. the learned arbitrator took into consideration the respective contentions of the parties and came to the conclusion that title has by reason of the deeds of sale passed on to awho. while arriving at the said finding the arbitrator has not applied wrong principle of law. sumangal procured land on behalf of awho. it for a specific purpose and with a view to avoid double payment of stamp duty entered into an arrangement whereby the owners of the agricultural land executed sale deeds in favour of awho. subject of course to furnishing bank guarantee sumangal received consideration. sumangal stated that by getting the land transferred in the their name by way of security at a nominal price as part of the turn key project awho has gained enormously to the tune of about.crores which they are not entitled to retain lawfully. they thus have unjustly enriched themselves. it does not appear that such a case has been made out before the learned arbitrators. the plea of unjust enrichment therefore can not be allowed to be raised at this juncture. such consideration was passed on to the owners of the land. requirements of section of the transfer of property act in respect of sale transaction were fully complied with. title to the said land thus apparently vested in awho and has become absolute its owners. no exception thus to that part of the award can be taken.conclusion:36. however we would like to clarify that the observations made hereinbefore were meant for the purpose of demonstrating that the learned arbitrators failed to apply the correct principles of law but not for the purpose of determining finally the lis between the parties. in other words the questions have been posed and answered for the limited purpose as to whether the award of the learned arbitrators suffer from any legal infirmity within the meaning of sections and of the arbitration act and no more. we therefore for the aforementioned reasons while upholding claim no. of the award are of the opinion that the award of the arbitrations in relation to claim no. must be set aside. consequently no interest thereupon shall be payable. the i.a. no. of is allowed to the aforementioned extent. no costs.
