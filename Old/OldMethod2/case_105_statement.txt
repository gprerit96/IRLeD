ar. lakshmanan j. by these appeals we are called upon to consider the legality correctness and validity of the impugned notification dated.appointing $$$.a. $$$ as the president of the industrial court at ahmedabad. a notification dated.. in this regard was issued by the order of governor by the labour and employment department of the government of gujarat in the gujarat government gazette whereby $$$.a. $$$ had been appointed as the president of the industrial court which was under challenge before the high court of gujarat in special civil application nos. and filed by $$$ gujarat

appointment afresh on the post of the president of the industrial court gujarat in the light of what has been held in the said order and in accordance with law. aggrieved by the order passed by the full bench of the high court the high court of gujarat through its registrar preferred special leave petition c nos. -on the grounds raised in the special leave petitions. by order dated.this court granted leave and made the interim order absolute. all these appeals involve common question of law based on some set of facts therefore we propose to decide these appeals by a common judgment. a special civil application was filed by the gujarat kishan mazdoor panchayat a registered trade union to direct the respondents therein not to make any appointments on the post of president of the industrial court save and except by appointing any member of the industrial court as president and other allied reliefs. a prayer to issue a writ of quo warranto was also asked for to direct $$$.a. $$$ -respondent no.in the application to state the basis of his right to be appointed as president of the industrial court and to set aside and quash the appointment order dated.purporting to appoint $$$.a. $$$ as president of the industrial court. the brief facts leading to the filing of the applications are briefly stated as under:. the bombay industrial relations act hereinafter referred to as the b.i.r. act governs the relationship between the employers and workmen in several industries operating in gujarat and more particularly the industry of textile the industry of power in the late bombay state area of gujarat the surat industry the banking industry run by banking companies having no branches outside the state of gujarat. sections and of the b.i.r. act thereof provide for setting up of labour courts and industrial court. section of the b.i.r. act which pertains to the setting up of a court of industrial arbitration to be known as industrial court is provided to consist of or more members of whom shall be its president. section of the b.i.r. act provides that every member of the industrial court shall be a person who is or has been a judge of high court or is eligible for being appointed a judge of such court provided inter alia that a person who has been a judge not lower in rank than that of assistant judge for not less than years or a person who has been the presiding officer of a labour court for not less than years shall also be eligible for appointment as a member of the industrial court. according to the respondents there are members of the industrial court. according to the respondents there are members of the industrial court functioning in gujarat state and so far as the labour courts are concerned there are judges functioning in gujarat of them are judges who have completed more than years since as labour judges and several more labour judges are those who have completed more than years ' service as labour judges and are therefore eligible for being appointed as members of the industrial court. when the post of president of the industrial court was vacant since the retirement of shri d.v. $$$ shri y.p. $$$ the senior -most member of the industrial court expressed his unwillingness to be appointed as president of the industrial court the post was therefore required to be filled up by a regular appointment. according to the respondents a person for being appointed as president should be a member of the industrial court and no except a member can be appointed as a president of the industrial court. it was therefore submitted before the high court that any from $$$ can be considered to be eligible for being appointed as president. it was further submitted that in view of the scheme of section of the b.i.r. act no who is not a member of the industrial court can be directly appointed as president of the industrial court. it was further argued before the high court that for members of the industrial court there is no other avenue of promotion except by way of appointment as president of the industrial court and now if the post of president is to be filled up by binding some from judicial service it will cause a great frustration among members of the industrial court as their hopes of promotion at an appropriate time will be dashed to the ground. opposing the applications it was submitted by the respondents appellant herein that no illegality was committed by recommending the name of $$$.a. $$$ for appointment as the president of the industrial court and that under $$$s and of the draft recruitment $$$s it has become necessary for the high court on its administrative side to recommend the appointment of an appropriate person by nomination on the said post under $$$ and that $$$.a. $$$ whose name was recommended is fulfilling the criteria prescribed by the government as per the old $$$s as well. it was submitted that considering the totality of the facts the high court of gujarat had not only acted within its rights but the same had been d in due discharge of the constitution duty. the petitirs respondents herein filed their rejoinder to the reply affidavit on behalf of the high court of gujarat reiterating the contentions raised in the applications. in $$$$ it was submitted that neither the appointment order nor the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the high court shows that the appointment was made by the governor of the state and that there is nothing to show that the full court was consulted by the appointing authority before making the appointment. it was further stated that assuming that the appointment by nomination can be made on the post of a president of the industrial court either under the old $$$s pertaining to the post of president or under the new $$$s which are at the draft stage only the candidate concerned should have atleast for years either held a judicial post in india or should have been an advocate for high court or should have expert knowledge of industrial matters. according to the petitirs respondents herein the appointee under the impugned appointment had not hold a judicial post for years and in fact he was holding the post of joint district judge only and he had not even completed years on the post of additional district judge to which post he was directly recruited. it was therefore submitted that the appointment had been made without coming to the conclusion that the appointee was fulfilling the criteria for appointment as required by the $$$s. an affidavit in reply was filed before the high court by the law officer of the high court of gujarat giving all details as to how the matter was considered by the standing committee of the high court and as to how the decision was taken to appoint $$$.a. $$$ as the president of the industrial court. the full bench of the high court by its judgment held that a reading of section of the b.i.r.act would show that it provides for the constitution of the industrial court with or more members of whom as its president and it also provides the eligibility for appointment as member of the industrial court. while the eligibility has been prescribed under section and of the b.i.r. act for being a member of the industrial court for the purpose of president of the industrial court all that has been said in $$$ -section of section of the b.i.r. act is that of $$$ shall be its president. therefore being a member of the industrial court is a pre -requisite and condition precedent for being the president of the industrial court and no person can be appointed as the president of the industrial court unless he is a member of the industrial court. the full bench further held that the absence of any $$$s with regard to the appointment on the post of president of the industrial court except the existing draft $$$s framed by the high court and the $$$s as had been framed under proviso to article of the constitution vide gujarat government gazette dated.being only for recruitment for the post of member industrial court and the $$$s for appointment of president industrial court as contained in the hand book that too that in consultation with the high court the only relevant provision which can be traced is section of the b.i.r. act and according to section of the b.i.r. act of $$$ has to be the president. the full bench further held that there was no lawful justification for excluding the candidates who were holding the post of member industrial court and whereas they have been kept out of consideration on the basis of the proposed draft $$$s the consideration for making the appointment to the post in question stands vitiated. elaborating further the full bench held in the instance there is no question of appointment by nomination on the basis of the proposed draft $$$s by holding that existing. members were not eligible because they have not completed years as member. in a given case when the only mode of appointment is promotion and it is found that no is eligible for appointment by promotion it may be open to make appointment by direct recruitment which would mean inviting application from all eligible candidates and then making the selection. no such procedure has been followed and the consideration was kept confined to $$$ of the judicial services who had conveyed their willingness for appointment as president of the industrial court. we find that the procedure which has been adopted and which has led to the impugned appointment is not in conformity either with the general right of equality under article of the constitution of india and with the right of equality in matters relating to employment as contemplated by article of the constitution of india and therefore this appointment can not be sustained in the eye of law.it is also not in dispute that the respondent no.had never been appointed as member of the industrial court and in terms of section of the bombay industrial relations act without being a member of the industrial court there is no question of his appointment as the president of the industrial court either by promotion or by direct recruitment. being a member of the industrial court is sine qua non for consideration for the post of president of the industrial court and no person who is not a member of industrial court would be considered for appointment as such without committing violence to the recruitment of section...in the instant case we find that the mode of direct recruitment is not contemplated and even if any direct recruitment is held for the post of president of industrial court when no member is eligible such direct recruitment is required to be held after affording equal opportunity to all those who are eligible. the proposed draft $$$s seeks to render $$$ to be ineligible by putting the condition of the completion of years service on the post of member. when the act has not put any such fetter and the act contemplates that of $$$ shall be the president and it is not stated that he must complete certain years of service as member through executive instructions such a requirement could not be pressed so as to defeat the right of consideration of $$$ for consideration of the post of the president. under section every member of the industrial court is eligible to be considered for the post of president notwithstanding the number of years of service put in by him as a member.in our consideration option section of the bombay industrial relations act is the only relevant provision to be taken note of for the purpose of appointment of the president and the only mode of appointment is by way of promotion from amongst $$$ and in this regard. if any $$$s are to be framed in exercise of the powers under chapter vi of part vi of the constitution of india the same can not be inconsistent with the requirements of the bombay industrial relations act... the high court for the reasons stated above quashed the notification which is impugned in the applications and further directed the respondents therein to proceed to make the appointment afresh on the post of the president of the industrial court gujarat in the light of what has been held in the said order and in accordance with law. aggrieved by the impugned judgment the above appeals by way of special leave petitions were preferred by the high court of gujarat. we heard shri mahendra anand learned senior counsel for the appellants and shri r. $$$ learned counsel for the contesting respondents. learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the provisions of section of the b.i.r. act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the president by promotion from amongst $$$ the president can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired high court judges. he further submitted that the high court failed to appreciate that section of the b.i.r. act does not envisage the mode of appointment and that the high court failed to appreciate that the words of section of the b.i.r. act are not that the president shall be appointed from of the current members of the industrial court and therefore the high court has errously read these words in section of the b.i.r. act. he further submitted that the high court failed to appreciate that section of the b.i.r. act provides for eligibility criteria and $$$.a. $$$ fulfils the eligibility criteria. he further submitted that the high court proceeded on an errous footing that the b.i.r. act does not contemplate the appointment by direct recruitment and only $$$ from the z of consideration for appointment to the post of president industrial court. per contra shri r. venkataramani learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents apart from reiterating the contentions in the applications submitted that section of the b.i.r. act clearly indicates that only member of industrial court is eligible for becoming the president of the industrial court and that becoming member of the industrial court is sine qua non for being considered for the post of president of the industrial court. according to him shri n.a. acharaya does not fulfil any of the eligibility conditions mentid in section of the b.i.r. act and that mandatory consultation with the gujarat public service commission was not followed. he further urged that the plain and natural meaning of section of the b.i.r. act is capable of only construction and that is only members of the industrial court could become its president. he further submitted that unless is or has been the judge of the high court the post of the president of the industrial court could be filled up only and only by way of promotion because there exist only post for the whole state of gujarat. he further contended that the impugned appointment was void and stillborn since the same was not made by $$$ the governor of gujarat but the same was purported to have been made in the name of the governor of gujarat. it was further contended that the appointment on a judicial post can be made only by $$$ the governor under article of the constitution of india and the state government can not issue notification appointing judicial officer under the business rules by and in the name of $$$ the governor of the state. he further submitted that even assuming the appointment to the post of president can be made through nomination or direct recruitment all $$$ were qualified for being appointed as president of the industrial court by nomination in accordance with the draft $$$s that were relied upon by the government supporting the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ and that $$$ were eligible for appointment by nomination according to the draft $$$s also and that $$$ of the draft $$$s provides inter alia that appointment to the post of president shall be made either a by promotion from amongst $$$ on the basis of seniority -comment subject to the provision that for being considered as eligible for such promotion the member concerned should have completed years service as a member of the industrial court by nomination. draft $$$ inter alia provides that to be eligible for appointment by nomination a candidate must have attest years either held a judicial post in india or been a advocate of high court or have expert knowledge of industrial matters. it was further contended that the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ straightaway by nomination without taking into consideration the cases of nomination of existing members of the industrial court who had completed years functioning as a judicial officer has been rightly held by the high court as violative of $$$ and of the constitution of india and that therefore no public appointment can be made in disregard of consideration of the cases of those who were qualified for the post. arguing further learned senior counsel for the respondents submitted that the appointment of a junior judicial officer as president of the industrial court without considering the cases of existing members of the industrial court who are senior on the basis of longer experience on equivalent post will also not be conducive to the judicial service which according to him will result in a junior judicial officer presiding over industrial court who have members far senior to the president and that junior judicial officer will thus exercise administrative powers of control over undisputedly senior judicial officers. it was further submitted that assuming that a district judge can be directly appointed to the post of president industrial court carrying a higher pay scale than that of the district judges in gujarat and assuming that even if somebody is already a member of the judiciary he can be nominated or directly appointed that he did not pass through the channel of promotion or selection meant for those who are already in service in view of article of the constitution even in that case there was no justification for the high court on the administrative side to pick up shri n.a. $$$ who was in the list of seniority at the relevant time. he submitted that the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ was also vitiated on account of the fact that if nomination or direct recruitment was a permissible course in the matter of appointment of the president of the industrial court then a large number of labour court judges advocates apart from the members of the industrial court who had completed years of practice or years of judicial work were also qualified for that appointment and therefore they could not be excluded from consideration. concluding his arguments he submitted that the high court 's conclusion that section of the b.i.r. act does not provide for nomination or direct recruitment and some has to be appointed from amongst $$$ of the industrial court only is correct and that there is no other provision in the entire b.i.r. act to provide for the mode of appointment of the president of the industrial court. in that view it is quite reasonable to read section of the b.i.r. act as providing that president can be appointed only from amongst $$$. we are given our thoughtful consideration on the rival submissions made by the respective counsel appearing on either side. before proceeding to consider the rival submissions it is useful to reproduce the relevant provisions governing the controversy which run as follows:"section. industrial court.the state government shall constitute a court of industrial arbitration.the industrial court shall consist of or more members of whom shall be its president( every member of the industrial court shall be a person who is not connected with the industrial dispute referred to such court or with any industry directly affected by such dispute.provided that no person shall be deemed to be connected with the industrial dispute or with the industry by reason only of the fact

age;(ii have for atleast years either held a judicial post in india or been an advocate for high court or have expert knowledge of industrial matters. in the background of the facts and circumstances and the provisions of law extracted above the following points arise for consideration by this court:-(a what is the true scope and interpretation of section read with section of the b.i.r. act?(b whether section of the b.i.r. act can be read to mean that the president of the industrial court must be appointed from among the existing members of the industrial court when the provision in fact is not in such whether the reading of the provisions of section of the b.i.r. act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selecting the president by promotion from amongst the members the president can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired high court judges or from the judges of the city civil court ahmedabad and district judges who fulfills the eligibility requirement for appointment as member of the industrial court?(d whether the high court has failed to appreciate that section of the b.i.r. act does not envisage the mode of appointment?. our attention was drawn to the relevant pleadings filed before the high court and also in this court. as already noticed the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ as the president of the industrial court vide notification dated.issued by the labour and employment department government of gujarat is under challenge by way of these appeals. the circumstances and the process which had culminated in the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ as the president of the industrial court had been fully narrated in the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of respondent no. in the high court. since shri d.v. $$$ who was working as the president of the industrial court was to retire on.and therefore the labour and employment department government of gujarat sent a communication dated.to the high court of gujarat inter alia stating therein that due to the retirement of shri d.v. $$$ the post will fall vacant and the question of preparing recruitment $$$s for the post of president of the industrial court is under consideration by the high court and till the $$$s are not finalized government can not take a decision in respect of the appointment on the said post. under these circumstances it was decided to place the matter for consideration of the standing committee of the high court of gujarat as to by which mode the post of the president industrial court is to be filled up. accordingly the said matter was considered by the standing committee of the high court of gujarat and it was decided on.that the post of president industrial court ahmedabad be filled up by nomination under $$$ b of $$$ of the proposed $$$s as n of the present members of the industrial court is eligible to be appointed to the said post by promotion having not completed years ' service on the post of member industrial court. the claim of all the incumbents of the post of member of the industrial court was examined in light of the criteria prescribed by the high court of gujarat for appointment on the post of president of industrial court. it was decided by the standing committee to fill up the post of president of the industrial court by nomination as stated above. in the light of the decision of the standing committee to fill up the post of the president of the industrial court by way of nomination it was further decided to ask for the willingness of the judicial officers working in the address of city court judges and district judges who are not less than years of age and have put in years of service in judiciary including the period of practice at the bar for being considered for appointment in question. pursuant to the said decision the willingness was called for and in all judicial officers had expressed willingness for being considered for the post in question the details of which have been furnished at page of the paper book. therefore the said matter was placed for consideration of the standing committee of the high court of gujarat and in the meeting of the standing committee held on.it was decided to direct the office to resubmit the matter along with the recruitment $$$s prescribing eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of president industrial court. pursuant to the said decision the matter was again considered in the light of the existing $$$ provision by the office. as per the directions of the standing committee the matte was again placed before the standing committee for further consideration along with the $$$ stated above. in the meeting of the standing committee of the high court held on.the consideration of the subject was deferred however in the meantime the office was directed to resubmit the matter pointing out the provisions of law in the matter particularly mentioning the provisions regarding eligibility experience and age of superannuation etc. prescribed for the post in question. pursuant to the said direction of the standing committee a detailed note was submitted for consideration of the standing committee and after considering all aspects in the meeting held on.the standing committee had taken decision to the effect that the name of shri n.a. $$$ joint district judge vadodara may be recommended to the labour and employment department government of gujarat for appointment as president of the industrial court ahmedabad by nomination provided under the recruitment rules for the post in question. accordingly the office had sent a communication to the government on.recommending the name of shri n.a. $$$ for appointment on the post of president industrial court ahmedabad. soon after the recommendation was made by the high court to the government as aforesaid a representation was received by the high court from shri b.i. $$$ the president gujarat industrial judges ' association ahmedabad in connection with the filling up of the post of president industrial court ahmedabad. in this connection $$$ was called for personal hearing on.and he was heard by the chief justice on the issue. again shri y.p. $$$ president in -charge of the industrial court vide his letter dated.expressed his unwillingness to be promoted as the president of the industrial court. on the basis of what is stated above it is clear that the decision to fill up the post of the president of the industrial court by way of nomination as provided under the rules was arrived at after considering all aspects not only that the process of selecting the person to be recommended to the government was also undertaken transparently and before taking the decision the matter was considered from time and again by the standing committee of the high court of gujarat and after due consideration and deliberations the decision was taken to recommend the name of shri n.a. $$$. considering the totality of the facts. it is clear to us that there is neither illegality nor arbitrariness in taking the decision of recommending the name of shri n.a. $$$ for appointment on the post of president industrial court ahmedabad. it is seen from the records that at the request of the government the eligibility criteria for appointment on the post of president industrial court has been determined by the high court and the same has been incorporated in the draft recruitment rules. we have already extracted rules & of the draft recruitment rules. shri n.a. $$$ is eligible for the post of the president industrial court ahmedabad as he has completed years service in judiciary including the period of practice at the bar. the period of practice / service of shri n.a. $$$ is given below period of practice / service of mr. n.a. in our opinion in the case of appointment of president of the industrial court by nomination it is not necessary that he must be appointed as member at the instance. section of the b.i.r. act deals with the composition of industrial court which does not lay down the mode of appointment. the words of section of the b.i.r. act are not that the president shall be appointed from of the current members of the industrial court. in our view the high court has errously read these words in section of the b.i.r. act. it is also seen that the proposed recruitment rules were framed by the high court at the request of the government and pending approval of the government. we are therefore of the opinion that the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ as president of the industrial court is not in breach of section of the b.i.r. act and also not violative of articles and of the constitution of india. to be eligible for appointment by nomination the candidate must not be connected with any industry as defined in the b.i.r. act and must not be less than years of age and have for atleast years either held a judicial post in india or been an advocate for high court or have expert knowledge of industrial matters. based on the recommendation of the high court on its administrative side the government of gujarat issued the notification on.whereby shri n.a. $$$ had been appointed as the president of the industrial court. considering the totality of the facts it is clear that by recommending the appointment in question the high court of gujarat had not only acted within its rights but the same had been d in due discharge of the constitutional duty. in our view section of the b.i.a. act can not be read to mean that the president of the industrial court must be appointed from amongst the existing members of the industrial court when the provision in fact is not in such terms. the high court has confused the concept of the president of the industrial court being from among the members of the said court with the errous concept that the said president must be from amongst the existing members of that court. a reading of the provisions of section of the b.i.r. act clearly spells out that apart from the mode of selection the president by promotion amongst the members the president can also directly be appointed from the sitting or retired high court judges or from the judges of city court ahmedabad and district judges. who fulfills the eligibility requirement for appointment as member of the industrial court. the high court in our view has failed to appreciate that the words of section of the b.i.r. act are not that the president shall be appointed from of the current members of the industrial court. the narrow interpretation of section of the b.i.r. act and the reasoning of the high court in our view completely rules out the appointment of president industrial court through the mode of nomination. in other words the high court failed to appreciate that once a person is appointed as the president of the industrial court he automatically becomes a member. section of the b.i.r. act only envisages that the president is the senior member of the industrial court and that the appointment of president of the industrial court is inherent in his appointment as member of the industrial court. this court in the case of state of maharashtra v. labour law practitirs ' association and ors.$$$ / sc/01/1998$$$ / sc/01/1998 held that the labour court judges and the judges of the industrial court belong to judicial service and recruitment is to be made in accordance with article of the constitution of india. the existing recruitment rules did not comply with the provision of article of the constitution of india. the state government therefore referred to the high court for consultation and approval of the rules. the administrative side of the high court framed the draft rules and the appointment offered to shri n.a. $$$ was in accordance with the draft rules. this apart the eligibility criteria for appointment on the post of the president of the industrial court has been determined by the high court and the same has been incorporated in the draft recruitment rules at the request of the government. for the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that no illegality is committed by recommending the name of shri n.a. $$$ as the president of the industrial court for appointment by nomination. the appeals are allowed. however in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.s.b. sinha j. although i agree with the conclusions arrived at by my learned brother having regard to the importance of the question involved i would like to assign additional reasons therefore. the high court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction in a matter of this nature is required to determine at the outset as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of a writ of certiorari or a writ of quo warranto. the jurisdiction of the high court to issue a writ of quo warranto is a limited. while issuing such a writ the court merely makes a public declaration but will not consider the respective impact of the candidates or other factors which may be relevant for issuance of writ of certiorari. see r.k. $$$ v. union of india and ors. reported in $$$ / sc/091/$$$$$$$ / sc/091/$$$$ scc. a writ of quo warranto can only be issued when the appointment is contrary to statutory rules. see mor modern cooperative transport society ltd. v. financial commissir & secretary to govt. of haryana and anr. $$$ / sc/057/00$$$ / sc/057/00. when questid mr. r. venkataramani learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondents fairly stated that in this case the high court was concerned with the question as to whether a writ of quo warranto can be issued or not. thus with a view to find out as to whether a case has been made out for issuance of quo warranto the only question which was required to be considered was as to whether shri n.a. $$$ fulfilled the qualifications laid down under $$$ -section of section of the bombay industrial relations act or not. the full bench of the high court has mainly proceeded on the basis that the industrial court was required to have or more members of whom shall be president as specified in sub -section of section and thus a person before he is appointed as the president must necessarily be appointed as a member. in my opinion while arriving at the said finding what the high court has failed to take into consideration was that sub -section of section did not impose any restriction on the power of the state to appoint a member or a president. the said provision merely speaks of the composition of the court of industrial arbitration. the expression shall consist of or more members is important. sub -section of section provides for the composition of the tribunal and nothing else. by necessary implication a president of the court of industrial arbitration would also have to be a member and precisely that was the reason why no separate qualification for the appointment of a president has been laid down in the act. sub -section of section of the act lays down the eligibility criteria of a member only. it is therefore significant that for the purpose of appointment of a member as also the president of the court of industrial arbitration the eligibility criteria remain the same. the legitimate expectation of a member to be promoted to the post of the chairman as has been submitted by mr. venkataramani will thus have no relevance as nobody has a vested right to be promoted. it may be true that reference has been made by the high court while making the recommendations to the draft rules known as draft recruitment rules but it appears from the records that the said draft rules purported to have been framed by the high court for replacing the recruitment rules for the post of president as contained at item in the handbook of guidelines on recruitment rules of officers under labour and employment department government of gujarat gandhinagar december were published in the year. it is now trite that draft rules which are made to lie in a nascent state for a long time can not be the basis for making appointment or recommendation. rules even in their draft stage can be acted upon provided there is a clear intention on the part of the government to enforce those rules in the near future. see vimal kumari v. state of haryana and ors. $$$ / sc/01/1998$$$ / sc/01/1998. sub -section of section of the act states that a member of the industrial court shall be a person who is or has been a judge of high court or is eligible for being appointed a judge of such court. article of the constitution of india inter alia lays down the qualification to be possessed by a citizen for his appointment as a high court judge. it has been and could not be disputed that shri n.a. $$$ has the requisite qualification. the other and further qualifications for appointment of a member have been laid down in the provisos appended thereto. the qualification specified in the said provisos are meant for those who do not satisfy the requirements of main provision. first and provisos appended to sub -section of section are exceptions to the main provisions. once it is held that sitting judicial officers can be appointed either as member or president of the court of industrial arbitration indisputably the high court is required to be consulted therefore. it is for the high court and high court al to nominate a person of its choice. such a practice is followed by all the high courts of the country and although the ultimate authority is the state the recommendations made by the high court is normally accepted. a statute as is well -known must be interpreted having regard to the purport and object which it seeks to achieve. the object of the act is to constitute industrial arbitration court for the purpose of adjudication of the disputes between the management and the workmen. such courts which are normally manned by the judicial officers can not be kept vacant for a long time. whenever they are meant to be filled up by the sitting judicial officers consultation with the high court is imperative. although we do not find any difficulty interpreting the provisions even if it be assumed that the provisions of sub -section and sub -section of section of the act render different meanings it is trite that in such an event the rule of purposive construction should be taken recourse to. in jt. registrar of cooperative societies kerala v. t.a. kuttappan and ors. $$$ / sc/02/2000$$$ / sc/02/2000 $$$ while interpreting the provisions dealing with the question as regard the duties and functions of committee of management of the society constituted under kerala cooperative societies. act this court observed:"the duty of such a committee or an administrator is to set right the default if any and to enable the society to carry on its functions as enjoined by law. thus the role of an administrator or a committee appointed by the registrar while the committee or management is under supersession is as pointed out by this court only to bring on an even keel a ship which was in doldrums. if that is the objective and is borne in mind the interpretation of these provisions will not be difficult. in associated timber industries

to supply an inadequacy to effect a change of policy to formulate a plan of government. that aim that policy is not drawn like nitrogen out of the air it is evidenced in the language of the statute as read in the light of other external manifestations of purpose some reflections on the reading of $$$s columbia lr at p.. that principle has been applied to this very act by this court recently in allahabad bank v. canara bank $$$ / sc/0262/2000$$$ / sc/0262/2000. if the said principle is applied it is clear that the provision in section must be construed in such a manner that after the act no suit by the bank is decided by the civil court and all such suits are decided by the tribunal. in k. duraisamy and anr. v. state of t.n. and ors. $$$ / sc/00/2001$$$ / sc/00/2001 it was $$$ mere use of the word reservation per se does not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective reservation specially designed for the advancement of any socially -and -educationally -backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to enable them to enter and adequately represent in various filed. the meaning content and purport of the expression will necessarily depend upon the purpose and object with which it is used. the court while interpreting the provision of a statute although is not entitled to re -writ the statute itself is not debarred from ironing out the creases. the court should always make an attempt to uphold the rules and interpret the same in such a manner which would make it workable. it is also a well settled principles of law that an attempt should be made to give effect to each and every word employed in a statute and such interpretation which would render a particular provision redundant or otiose should be avoided. in reserve bank of india v. peerless co. $$$ / sc/007/1987$$$ / sc/007/1987 this court said:-"interpretation must depend on the text and the context. they are the basis of interpretation. one may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour. neither can be ignored. both are important. that interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. a statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. with this knowledge the statute must be read a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word. if a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. with these glasses we must look at the act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to any as to fit into the scheme of the entire act. no part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation $$$s have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place... in the interpretation and application of $$$s by $$$ the author at page has discussed the subject while dealing with the importance of context of the statute in the following terms:-..the essence of the language is to reflect express and perhaps even effect the conceptual matrix of established ideas and values that identifies the culture to which it belongs. for this reason language has been called conceptual map of human experience. the purport and object of the $$$ is to see that a tribunal becomes functional and as such the endeavors of the court would be to see that to achieve the same an interpretation of section of the act be made in such a manner so that appointment of a president would be possible even at the initial constitution thereof. such a construction is permissible by taking recourse to the doctrine of strained construction as has been succinctly dealt with by $$$ in his statutory interpretation. at section of the treatise purposive construction has been described in the following purposive construction of an enactment is which gives effect to the legislative purpose by following the literal meaning of the enactment where that meaning is in accordance with the legislative purpose in this $$$ called a purposive -and -literal construction or(b applying a strained meaning where the literal meaning is not in accordance with the legislative purpose in the $$$ called a purposive -and -strained construction. in dpp v. $$$ ac it was held that severance may be effected even where the blue pencil technique is impracticable. in js v. $$$ settled estates act the law is stated in the following terms:-..i am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the act. but in doing so the task on which a court of justice is engaged remains of construction even where this involves reading into the act words which are not expressly included in it. kammins ballrooms co. ltd. v. zenith investments torquay ltd. ac provides an instance of this but in that case the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied. first it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the act read as a whole precisely what the mischief was that it was the purpose of the act to remedy it was apparent that the draftsman and parliament had by inadvertence overlooked and so omitted to deal with an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the act was to be achieved and ly it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the $$$ passed into law. unless this condition is fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the act can not be justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to determine what is the meaning of a written law which parliament has passed. in principles of statutory interpretation of justice g.p. singh 5th edition it is stated:"the supreme court in bangalore water supply v. a. $$$ / sc/0257/1978$$$ / sc/0257/1978 approved the rule of construction stated by denning l.j. while dealing with the definition of industry in the industrial disputes act. the definition is so general and ambiguous that beg c.j. said that the situation called for some judicial heroics to cope with the difficulties raised. k. iyer j.who delivered the leading majority judgment in that case referred with approbation the passage extracted above from the judgment of denning l.j. in seaford court estates ltd. v. $$$. but in the same continuation he also cited a passage from the speech of lord simonds in the case of magor & st. mellons r.d.c. v. newport corporation all er as if it also found a part of the judgment of denning l.j. this passage reads the duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used. those words may be ambiguous but even if they are the power and duty of the court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited.as earlier noticed lord simonds and other law lords in magor and st. mellon 's case were highly critical of the views of denning l.j. however as submitted above the criticism is more because of the unconventional manner in which the rule of construction was stated by him. in this connection it is pertinent to remember that although a court can not supply a real casus omissus it is equally clear that it should not so interpret a statute as to create a casus omissus when there is really n. in hameedia hardware stores v. b. $$$ / sc/0180/1988$$$ / sc/0180/1988 the rule of addition of word had been held to be permissible in the following words:-"we are of the view that having regard to the pattern in which clause a of sub -section of section of the act is enacted and also the context the words if the landlord required it for his own use or for the use of any member of his family which are found in sub -clause ii of section of the act have to be read also into sub -clause iii of section of the act. sub -clauses ii and both deal with the non -residential buildings. they could have been enacted as sub -clauses by adding a conjunction and between the said sub -clauses in which event the clause would have read thus in case it is a non -residential building which is used for the purpose of keeping & vehicle or adapted for such use if the landlord required it for his own use or for the use of any member of his family and if he or any member of his family is not occupying any such building in the city town or village concerned which is his own and in case it is any other non -residential building if the landlord or member of his family is carrying on a non -residential building in the city town or village concerned which is his own. if the sub -clauses are not so read it would lead to an absurd result. in punjab land development and reclamation corporation ltd.chandigarh v. presiding officer labour court chandigarh and ors. $$$ / sc/09/1990$$$ / sc/09/1990 this court held:"the court has to interpret a statute and apply it to the facts. hans kelsen in his pure theory of law. p. makes a distinction between interpretation by the science of law or jurisprudence on the hand and interpretation by a law -applying organ especially the court on the other. according to him jurisprudential interpretation is purely cognitive ascertainment of the meaning of legal norms. in contradistinction to the interpretation by legal organs jurisprudential interpretation does not create law. the purely cognitive interpretation by jurisprudence is therefore unable to fill alleged gaps in the law. the filling of a so -called gap in the law is a law -creating function that can only be performed by a law -applying organ and the function of creating law is not performed by jurisprudence interpreting law. jurisprudential interpretation can do no more than exhibit all possible meanings of a legal norm. jurisprudence as cognition of law can not decide between the possibilities exhibited by it but must leave the decision to the legal organ who according to the legal order is authorised to apply the law. according to the author if law is to be applied by a legal organ he must determine the meaning of the norms to be applied he must interpret those norms p. interpretation therefore is an intellectual activity which accompanies the process of law application in its advance from a higher level to a lower level. according to him the law to be applied is a frame. there are cases of intended or unintended indefiniteness at the lower level and several possibilities are open to the application of law.the traditional theory believes that the statute applied to a concrete case can always supply only correct decision and that the positive -legal correctness of this decision is based on the statute itself. this theory describes the interpretive procedure as if it consisted merely in an intellectual act of clarifying or understanding as if the law -applying organ had to use only his reason but not his will and as if by a purely intellectual activity among the various existing possibilities only correct choice could be made in accordance with positive law. according to the author the legal act applying a legal norm may be performed in such a way that it conforms with the or the other of the different meanings of the legal norm with the will of the norm -creating authority that is to be determined somehow with the expression which the norm -creating authority has chosen d with the or the other of the contradictory norms or the concrete case to which the contradictory norms refer may be decided under the assumption that the contradictory norms annul each other. in all these cases the law to be applied constitutes only a frame within which several applications are possible whereby every act is legal that stays within the frame. in s. $$$ v. state of andhra pradesh $$$ / sc/05/1996$$$ / sc/05/1996 this court observed it is a well -known rule of interpretation of statutes that the text and the context of the entire act must be looked into while interpreting any of the expressions used in a statute. the courts must look to the object which the statute seeks to achieve while interpreting any of the provisions of the act. a purposive approach for interpreting the act is necessary. in public services tribunal bar association v. state of u.p. and anr. $$$ / sc/0062/2003$$$ / sc/0062/2003 this court noticed section of u.p. public services tribunal act which provided for different qualifications for chairman vice -chairman judicial and vice -chairman administration as also judicial and $$$ of the service tribunal. a bench of this court of which of us hon'ble the chief justice of india was a member held that as appointment of chairman vice chairman judicial vice -chairman administration and members are to be made in consultation with the chief justice of the high court the act is intra vires. the said decision is also a pointer to show that whenever a post is to be filled up by the judicial member who is eligible to be appointed as a high court judge consultation with the high court is imperative. furthermore if the interpretation of section of the act as propounded by the high court is accepted no president can be appointed directly by the state at the time of constitution of the court. such a situation therefore would lead to absurdity if it is held that the candidate must first be appointed as a member and the post of president can be filled up inter alia by way of promotion or otherwise. when literal interpretation of a provision leads to absurdity or manifest injustice it is trite the same must be avoided. furthermore if the legislature intended to lay down different qualifications or eligibility criteria for the president and the members it would have expressly stated so. we may in this connection notice the provisions of the consumer protection act. in absence of an express provision providing either for different qualification or eligibility criteria or the selection process the same procedure for appointment must be followed. both under the existing rules as also the draft rules mode and manner of appointment have been laid down. even in absence of the draft rules in terms of rule of the recruitment rules for the president of industrial court appointment can be made by nomination. thus appointment to the post of president could be made by way of nomination also subject to the nominees holding requisite qualifications laid down therefore. it is further trite that non -mentioning or wrong mentioning of a provision of law would not invalidate an order if a source therefore can be found out either under general law or a statute law. it is further well -settled that when there are sources of power even if one is not applicable the order will not be become invalid if the power of the statutory authority can be traced to another source. for the reasons aforementioned taking any view of the matter it can not be said that the appointment of shri n.a. $$$ was illegal or invalid. the impugned judgment therefore can not be sustained which is therefore set aside. the appeal is allowed.
