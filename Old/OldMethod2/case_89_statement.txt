. leave granted. this appeal has been preferred by $$$ against the order dated th june in cwp no. passed by the high court of h.p. at shimla. the only question that arises for determination is whether the appellants are entitled for regular appointment in view of the fact that they were appointed after following all procedure of selection including recommendation of the public service commission and are continuing in service since long. the factual matrix of the case is as follows in exercise of power conferred under section read with section of the electricity supply act the h.p. state electricity board hereinafter referred to as electricity board by notification dated st november repealed the ' recruitment and promotion regulations for the post of assistant accounts officer class -i gazetted and framed new regulations known as the h.p. electricity board recruitment and promotion regulations for the post of assistant accounts officer. the said regulation prescribes the total number of posts scale of pay the percentage of posts to be filled up by direct recruitment / contract by promotion qualification etc. relevant portion of the regulation reads as follows:4. after publication of regulation the electricity board decided to fill up the posts of assistant accounts officer through h.p. public service commission. by letter dated th $$$$ the electricity board requested the principal secretary power government of $$$ to take steps to fill up posts by direct recruitment on regular basis and to send requisition to the public service commission. the letter dated th $$$$ reads as follows:"himachal $$$ stateelectricity boarddated.. hpseb(sectt)/02 ---tothe pr. secretary power)to the govt. of h.p. shimla-2.subject:- recruitment of assistant accounts officers on regular basis.sir i am directed to say that as per r & p regulations notified by the board vide dated.for filling up the posts of assistant accounts officers a provision has been made to

assistant accounts officers in the board are posts out of which posts are to be filled by promotion and posts are to be filled in by direct recruitment. since the officers in feeder grade could not qualify the sas part -ii examination and as also to induct professionally qualified persons with qualification like charted accountant mb finance etc.in the cadre the provision for filling up % posts of assistant accounts officers by direct recruitment has been made.at present all the posts meant for direct recruitment are lying vacant and the work in various units is suffering. the matter was

of assistant accounts officers to till up the above posts on regular basis.yours faithfully $$$.p. state electricity board $$$ shimla-4. in the form attached with aforesaid requisition for recruitment of candidates to the posts of assistant accounts officer on regular basis scale of pay the number of posts etc. were shown relevant portion of which reads as for the recruitment of candidates for appointment to the of assistant accounts officer on regular basisfrom the aforesaid requisition it is clear that regular posts of assistant accounts officers were requisitioned to be filled up in the regular pay scale of -with clear stipulation that the selected candidates will be on probation for a period for years subject to such further extension for a period not exceeding year as may be ordered in special circumstances for reasons to be recording in writing. however when the $$$ public service commission issued advertisement no. ix/200 on th november inviting applications to the post of assistant accounts officer class -i for the reasons not disclosed by respondents the scale of pay was shown % of the regular pay and the nature of appointment on contract basis as apparent from clause c of the advertisement which reads as follows:"(c department of m.p.p. & power h.p. pursuant to the said advertisement appellants applied for the post of assistant accounts officer class -i and after written test and interview and on being selected their names were recommended by the $$$ public service commission and intimated through press note. therein it was mentioned that their appointment to the post of assistant accounts officer will be on contract basis. the said press note reads as follows:"$$$ public servicecommissionpress note$$$ public service commission has declared the result of the interviews held from $$$$ and $$$$ to 6th $$$$ for recruitment to the of assistant accounts officers on contract basis in the department of mpp and power h.p. the names of following candidates are being recommended to the government for appointment the result is also available on commission 's website at www.himachal.nic.in / hppsc.sd/-under secretaryh.p. public service commission'sshimla-02"8. thereafter the secretary of the $$$ electricity board by letter dated 2nd july forwarded the names of appellants to the chief medical officer $$$ upadhyaya hospital district hospital shimla h.p.with a request to constitute a medical board to conduct medical examination of the appellants and other recommended candidates. having found fit the appellants were appointed in the year to the post of assistant accounts officer class i but on contract basis. having found fit and in absence of any allegation against them their period of contract was extended from time to time and now they have completed more than years of service. $$$ appearing for the appellants contended that all procedure for regular appointment having been complied with including recommendation by the public service commission there was no occasion for the respondents to employ them on contract basis and there should not be any difficulty to provide them regular appointment. $$$ for the respondent opposed the prayer on the ground that their appointment were made in terms of regulation on contract basis and there is no provision for regularization of service. we have considered the rival contention perused the record and the regulations framed by the government. from the facts as noticed above we find that the electricity board was in need of regular assistant account officers class i and their being posts vacant they made requisition to fill up all the posts on regular basis. respondents have failed to disclose the circumstances in which the advertisement was published by the public service commission the scale of pay was shown @ % of the regular pay and the nature of appointment on contract basis. in fact in the said advertisement for the post of assistant accounts officer class -i the posts reserved for different categories were shown i. gen.sc-01 $$$$ obc-01 ex -servicemen gen.disabled person low $$$ total-14 posts. thus we find even the rule of reservation was also followed. the action on the part of the respondents / state authorities including the public service commission prescribing % of the regular pay of + dp on contract basis initially for year extendable on $$$$ basis is against the requisition and the decision taken by electricity board. such action on the part of the authorities not only amounts to unfair employment practice but also arbitrary and violative of article of the constitution of india. it is clear that the terms of conditions of payment at the rate of % of regular pay and nature of appointment on contract basis was inserted in the advertisement by the state authorities and the h.p. public service commission at later stage just to deprive the candidates from their regular pay and their right to continue in the service. the high court failed to noticed the aforesaid fact and erred in holding that the regularization of service is not permissible. in fact it was not a case of regularisation of service of the appellants but is a case wherein direction ought to have been issued on the respondents to provide the appellants with orders of regular appointment from the date of their initial appointment and to treat the initial period of years as probation and to provide them with other consequential benefits. for the reasons aforesaid we set aside the impugned judgment dated 27th june passed by the high court of $$$ at shimla in cwp no. of and direct the respondents to provide letter of regular appointment to the appellants w.f. the date of their initial appointment treating the initial years as on probation with further direction to provide the appellants with consequential benefits including regular scale of pay increment arrears of pay seniority etc. to which they are entitled under the law. the formal orders in compliance with this court 's order to be issued within months and consequential benefits should be paid within months. the appeal is allowed with aforesaid observations and directions no costs.
