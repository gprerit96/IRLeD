$$$ j. aggrieved by the common judgment dated.of the high court of kerala in o.p. $$$ no. of and o.p. $$$ no. of the unsuccessful petitirs therein preferred these special leave petitions. leave granted. the above -mentid original petitions writ petitions were filed aggrieved by the order dated.passed by the kerala administrative tribunal for short the tribunal by which the tribunal disposed of the original applications o.a. nos. and. the background facts of the instant litigation are as follows the kerala public service commission for short the service commission issued a notification dated.inviting applications from the qualified candidates for appointment to the posts of sub -inspector trainee. the notification did not specify the number of posts sought to be filled up but mentid that the posts are sought to be filled up from sources. they are,(1 category no. 1/00 -open market( category no. -graduate ministerial staff of police and vigilance department fingerprint experts fingerprint searchers of the finger print bureau.category no. 1/00 -graduate police $$$ head $$$ and officers of the corresponding rank in the police department. it is also specified in the notification that the vacancies will be apportid among the categories mentid above in accordance with certain orders issued earlier by the government of kerala the details of which are not necessary for the purpose of this judgment. there are a set of rules known as the kerala public service commission rules of procedure for short rules of procedure containing the procedure to be followed by the service commission in making selections for filling up any posts in the service of the state of kerala. when the service commission is so called upon the service commission is authorised to conduct or more of the examinations indicated under rule of the said rules to assess merit of candidates who seek appointment. the relevant portion of the rule reads:. the commission may conduct all or any or more of the following examinations to assess the merits of candidates considered for recruitment to a service or post;(i written examination(ii practical test(iii physical efficiency test(iv oral test interview)(v any other test or examination which the commission may deem fit to hold. further under rule wherever the service commission decides to conduct either a written examination or a practical test or both for filling up any posts the service commission is required to announce the following information:(i announce:(a the qualifications required of the candidates for the examination;(b the conditions of admission to the examination including the fees;(c the subjects $$$ or syllabus of the examination the number of vacancies to be filled from among the candidates for the examination. in response to the notification the service commission received about applications. for the recruitment in question the service commission admittedly decided to hold a written examination followed by an oral test contemplated under rule hereinafter referred to as rule examinations for the sake of convenience. however in view of the large number of applications received the service commission thought it fit to shortlist candidates who could be permitted to appear for the rule examinations by conducting a preliminary examination for all the applicants. the commission initially opined that out of the total applicants could be short -listed through such examination process. after the examination was conducted on examining the list of successful candidates who stood at the top of the list the service commission reached a tentative conclusion that subjecting only those candidates for the rule examinations may not yield enough candidates to fill up vacancies belonging to various reserved categories $$$ st and obc. therefore the service commission decided to permit some more candidates belonging to various reserved categories. the last of the abovementid candidates secured marks out of a total of marks for which the examination was conducted. the service commission therefore decided to permit various reserved category candidates who secured marks above the cut -off marks specified in that behalf by the service commission. the cut -off marks so specified with respect to each of the reserved categories are as . pursuant to such exercise another candidates became eligible to appear in the rule examinations. the decision of the service commission to relax cut -off marks with respect to reserved category candidates came to be challenged initially before the kerala administrative tribunal. in view of the tribunal 's decision dated.dismissing the applications the matter was further carried by way of writ petition to the kerala high court unsuccessfully. eventually the matter reached this court in slp..cc no. of which stood dismissed by an order dated.. the service commission conducted the rule examinations selected candidates and published a ranked list"1 on.. $$$ candidates were sent for training. those who successfully completed the training were appointed and given posting. the appellants are among candidates so appointed belonging to various reserved categories. they were appointed against open category vacancies. however they were not among the top candidates identified in the preliminary screening test but appeared for the rule examinations by virtue of the relaxation granted in favour of the candidates belonging to various reserved classes. meanwhile various original applications out of which the instant appeals arise came to be filed before the tribunal. the relief sought in of the applications declare that the inclusion of the candidate who secured less than marks in the preliminary examination in the main list of annexure a6 is illegal.direct the rd respondent to remove the candidates who secured less than marks in the preliminary examination from the main list of annexure a6.direct the rd respondent not to advise and respondents and not to appoint any candidate who secured less than marks in the preliminary examination against the vacancies available for open competition candidates. prayers in the other original applications are similar. by its order dated.the tribunal allowed the said original applications. the service commission challenged the said order in original petition i. o.p. $$$ no. of. the appellants in slp c no. sought a review of the order dated.of the tribunal on the ground that the said order would adversely affect their interest though they were not parties to the said proceedings. however by an order dated.the review petition was rejected by the tribunal. therefore the unsuccessful review petitioners preferred original petition $$$ no. of challenging the order of the tribunal dated.. the petitioner in slp c no. of was $$$$ $$$ no. filed challenging the order dated.of the kerala administrative tribunal. both the original petitions along with other similar petitions were heard together and dismissed by a common judgment and order impugned in the instant appeals. the selection and appointment of the appellants is challenged on the ground that they are not among the candidates who secured marks and above in the preliminary screening test and therefore they would not have been eligible to appear for the rule examinations but for the relaxation granted subsequent to the preliminary examination. therefore they can not be appointed to open category posts. according to the contesting respondents relaxation was granted only to ensure that there are sufficient number of candidates to fill up reserved category posts. by allowing the appellants to compete for the open category posts the service commission acted in violation of $$$ and of the constitution of india. the posts in question are governed by the kerala state and subordinate services rules for short kerala s&s rules made in exercise of the power under article of the constitution of india. rule enables the state to reserve some of the posts in question in favour of the scheduled caste scheduled tribes and other backward classes. indisputably some of the posts in question are so reserved. this court in r.k. sabharwal and ors. v. state of punjab and ors. $$$ / sc/09/$$$$$$$ / sc/09/$$$$ scc held that where certain number of posts are reserved in favour of candidates belonging to socially and economically backward classes meritorious candidates belonging to those classes should not be appointed to such reserved posts but shall be appointed to posts falling in the open category. the said principle is reiterated in ritesh r. $$$ v. dr. y.l. yamul and ors. $$$ / sc/06/$$$$$$$ / sc/06/$$$$ scc in the context of admissions to the educational institutions medical colleges where seats are reserved in favour of students belonging to socially and economically backward classes. this court on examination of various judgments including r.k. sabharwal supra held;17... in view of the legal position enunciated by this court in the aforesaid cases the conclusion is irresistible that a student who is entitled to be admitted on the basis of merit though belonging to a reserved category can not be considered to be admitted against seats reserved for reserved category... it is application of the above principle which is the subject matter of dispute in the instant appeal. as already noticed appellants secured good marks in the rule examinations therefore they should be entitled for appointment against open category posts by operation of the principle of law laid down in the above -mentioned judgments. the contesting respondents however disputed application of the above -mentioned principle of law on the ground that appellants could appear for the rule examinations only pursuant to a concession granted by the service commission and can not therefore be treated as more meritorious candidates who are entitled to be appointed to open category posts. this submission found favour with the administrative tribunal and the high court. in substance both the fora held that but for the concession the appellants would not have been able to participate in the rule examinations at all consequently whatever be the performance of the appellants in the examination their chance appearance in the rule examinations does not confer any right on them to claim open category posts and they are entitled to compete only for those posts which are reserved in favour of the respective class to which each of the appellants belongs. for reaching such a conclusion the high court relied upon rule of the kerala s&s rules and rule of the rules of procedure. the high court held:2. reading of these judgments would show that in none of these cases supreme court had occasion to consider a rule similar to rule or the proviso to rule of the rules of procedure. on the other hand the apex court had generally dealt with the legal position that when relaxation or concession is given at the preliminary stage which has no impact on the final ranking the relaxation so given can not have any relevance in so far as the final ranking is concerned. while we respectfully follow these principles in our view having regard to the fact that rule of the proviso to rule of the rules of procedure govern the selection in question the general principles laid down by the apex court in the judgments relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioners can not be applied to the facts of these cases.and distinguished earlier judgments of this court chattar singh and ors. v. state of rajasthan and ors. $$$ / sc/008/1997$$$ / sc/008/1997 scc andhra pradesh public service commission v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/08/$$$$$$$ / sc/08/$$$$ scc and $$$ and anr. v. state of uttar pradesh and ors. $$$ / sc/002/$$$$$$$ / sc/002/$$$$ scc. in our opinion the conclusion reached by the high court is erroneous. the preliminary examination for shortlisting candidates who would be eligible to take the rule examinations has no statutory basis. neither the kerala s&s rules nor the rules of procedure contemplate such preliminary examination. however this court recognized existence of a legal authority to conduct a preliminary examination wherever an unmanageably large number of applications are received for filling up a limited number of posts. rule of the kerala s&s rules and rule of the rules of procedure relied upon by the high court refer to ranked list -a defined expression under rule of the rules of procedure. such ranked -list is prepared only pursuant to the rule examinations. a preliminary screening test is outside the purview of the rule examinations. therefore irrespective of the content of rule of the kerala s&s rules or the proviso to rule of the rules of procedure relied upon by the high court these rules can have no application in the context of preparation of a shortlist pursuant to a preliminary examination. therefore the basic premise on which the high court sought to distinguish the judgments relied upon by the appellants referred to supra is legally untenable. the impugned judgment rightly understood the judgments relied upon by the appellants herein as laying down a principle that a relaxation or concession given at the preliminary stage can not have any relevance in determining the merit of the candidate. in the circumstances we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment is unsustainable and is accordingly set -aside. the appeals are allowed with no order as to costs.1a defined expression
