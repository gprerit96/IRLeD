. heard learned senior counsel for the parties. the correctness of the judgment and order of conviction for the charge of offence punishable under section indian penal code is under challenge in this appeal on various grounds and pray to set aside the same. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ placed reliance upon the judgment of this court in hariram v. state of rajasthan and anr. reported in manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc wherein this court interpreted section and of the juvenile justice care and protection of children act as amended by act of claiming benefit of juvenility for the $$$ contending that as on the date of the commission of offence on.he has not attained the age of years as per his date of birth i... therefore the benefit of section juvenile was determined under section of the act. by virtue of explanation to section of the act he is entitled for the benefit. the finding recorded by the learned trial judge that his date of birth is.was on the basis of the school records as well as school certificate. this fact has attained finality not disputed by the respondent and that finding has affirmed by the high court in the appeal filed by the $$$. the correctness of the concurrent finding is under challenge by the respondent in these proceedings. the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ has placed reliance on the judgment of this court in hariram 's case supra wherein this court has laid down the law after framing the following question at paragraph which reads as under:. the question which has been frequently raised is whether a male person who was above years on the date of commission of the offence prior to.would be entitled to be considered as a juvenile for the said offence if he had not completed the age of years on the said date. in other words could a person who was not a juvenile within the meaning of the act when the offence was committed but had not completed years be governed by the provisions of the juvenile justice act and be declared as a juvenile in relation to the offence alleged to have been committed by. the said question after considering the rival legal submissions made at the bar with reference to the aforesaid statutory provisions of the act was answered by recording its reasons at paragraphs and which reads thus:$$$$. accordingly a juvenile who had not completed years on the date of commission of the offence was also entitled to the benefits of the juvenile justice act as if the provisions of section had always been in existence even during the operation of the act. the said position was re -emphasised by virtue of the amendments introduced in section of the act whereby the proviso and $$$ were added to section which made it even more explicit that in all pending cases including trial revision appeal and any other criminal proceedings in respect of a juvenile in conflict with law the determination of juvenility of such a juvenile would be in terms of clause of section of the act and the provisions of the act would apply as if the said provisions had been inforced when the alleged offence was committed. in view of the aforesaid pronouncement of law laid down by this court in hariram 's case referred to supra upon which reliance has rightly been placed by the learned senior counsel for the $$$ we have to apply the said legal principle to the fact situation particularly having regard to the fact that the juvenility as on the date of occurrence is a proved fact. after laying down the principle of law in paras and of the said decision this court has set aside the order passed by the high court keeping in view of the provisions of section and as amended by act of and the juvenile justice rules and held that in that case the $$$ was below years of age at the time of commission of the offence and the provisions of the said act would apply in this case in full force. in view of the aforesaid decision rendered in hariram 's case the said legal principle with all fours is applicable to the facts situation of the present case. mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel for the respondent / state placed reliance upon the judgment of this court in jitendra singh @ babboo singh and anr. v. state of uttar pradesh reported in manu / sc/06/$$$$manu / sc/06/$$$$ scc emphasising paragraph -which are extracted hereunder:3. in kalu case reported in manu / sc/065/$$$$manu / sc/065/$$$$ scc the plea of juvenility was raised before this court for the first time as is the position in the present case also. this court while dealing with the options available noticed the absence of plea on the ground of juvenility and held that even if such a plea had been raised before the high court the high court would have had to record its finding that kalu alias amit was guilty confirm his conviction set aside the sentence and forward the case to the board for passing an order under section of the juvenile act. the court observed scc p. para. the instant offence took place on.. as we have already noted kalu alias amit was a juvenile on that date. he was convicted by the trial court on.. the juvenile act came into force on.. the appeal of kalu alias amit was decided by the high court on.. had the defence of juvenility been raised before the high court and the fact that kalu alias amit was a juvenile at the time of commission of offence has come to light the high court would have had to record its finding that kalu alias amit was guilty confirm his conviction set aside the sentence and forward the case to the board and the board would have passed any appropriate order permissible under section of the juvenile act see $$$. that procedure has been followed in several other cases where this court has after holding the accused to be a juvenile as on the date of the commission of offence set aside the sentence awarded to him without interfering with the order of conviction. see pradeep kumar v. state of u.p.bhola bhagat v. state of bihar upendra kumar v. state of bihar and vaneet kumar gupta v. state of punjab. in the totality of the above circumstances there is no reason why the conviction of the $$$ should be interfered with simply because he is under the act a juvenile entitled to the benefit of being referred to the board for an order under section of the said act. there is no gainsaying that even if the $$$ had been less than years of age on the date of occurrence he would have been referred for trial to the juvenile court in terms of the occurrence he would have been referred for trial to the juvenile court in terms of section of the act. the juvenile court would then hold a trial and record a conviction or acquittal depending upon the evidence adduced before it. in an ideal situation a case filed before an ordinary criminal court when referred to the board or juvenile court may culminate in a conviction at the hands of the board also. but law does not countenance a situation where a full -fledged trial and even an appeal ends in a conviction of the accused but the same is set aside without providing for a trial by the board.he submits that in view of the aforesaid judgment the order of conviction of the $$$ ought not be interfered with but sentence for life imprisonment passed by the high court may be set aside. in view of the contentions of both the learned senior counsel for the parties and foregoing reasons we have to hold that the $$$ is entitled for the benefit of the juvenility. in view of the aforesaid pronouncement of law made by this court in hariram 's case of which relevant portion is extracted above we are required to set aside the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence and we do so. accordingly we allow the appeal and remit the matter to the juvenile justice board district etava to exercise its power under section for the purpose of conducting enquiry and dispose of the same within weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment. taking into consideration the age of the appellant and also the fact that he had underwent sentence for months pursuant to the order of conviction and sentence passed by the learned trial judge exercise shall be made by the board within the time stipulated and pass appropriate order after conducting an enquiry.
