. this appeal is directed against the judgment and order passed by the high court of karnataka at bangalore in criminal appeal no. of dated.whereby the high court has upheld the judgment and order of the trial court in spl cc no. dated.. the brief facts of the case are as follows the $$$ had been working as a junior assistant in the office of the deputy registrar bangalore university at the time of the alleged incident. in november the complainant approached the $$$ for the issue of a provisional certificate. after multiple meetings the $$$ stating that a payment would have to be made to his superintendent for the issuance of provisional certificate demanded a sum of as bribe and agreed to the same. on.$$$$ filed a complaint before the deputy superintendent of police lokayukta city division pw- who then registered a case as crime no. pre -trap proceedings including smearing the currency with phenolphthalein powder were completed. immediately thereafter together with the shadow witness went to the $$$ 's office and handed over the tainted currency notes to him. on 's signal the trap team led by $$$ entered the $$$ 's office and questid him regarding the tainted currency notes given to him by. the tainted notes were seized and their chemical examination was completed. the $$$ was arrested and then released on bail. subsequently on sanction for prosecution being received the investigation was completed and a charge sheet was filed before the trial court. $$$ on summons being issued the $$$ appeared before the learned special judge. after both sides were heard charges were framed against the $$$ for offences under section and section read with section of the prevention of corruption act for short the act. the charges were read over and explained to the $$$ who pleaded not guilty. consequently the case was committed to trial. the prosecution examined witnesses and produced documents and material objects. the $$$ 's statement was recorded under section of the code of criminal procedure for short the code wherein he stated that he had been falsely implicated. the trial court considered the evidence on record as also the arguments of the parties and noticed that the evidence on record was sufficient to prove that the $$$ had demanded illegal gratification from in return for showing official favour. the trial court further rejected the $$$ 's contentions that the prosecution 's case was mala fide that the tainted currency notes had been forcibly placed in his pant pocket by and that the order of sanction for prosecution was invalid. therefore the trial court concluded that the $$$ was guilty of the offences charged against him and vide judgment and order dated.convicted the $$$ and sentenced him to simple imprisonment for year and a fine of for the offence under section of the act and simple imprisonment for year and a fine of for the offence under section of the act with directions that both sentences would run concurrently. aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence the accused approached the high court by filing a criminal appeal on the grounds inter alia that the trial court had failed to correctly appreciate the evidence on record that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were inconsistent and could not be relied on that the prosecution had failed to examine certain material witnesses and that on the date of the alleged incident $$$ was not duly authorized to investigate the $$$ 's case. by the impugned judgment and order the high court re -appreciated the entire evidence on record and observed that pws and were both trustworthy witnesses and that the non -examination of panch witness would not be fatal to the prosecution 's case. the high court further rejected the $$$ 's contention that $$$ was not authorized to investigate the $$$ 's case. therefore the high court concluded that the prosecution had been able to establish the $$$ 's guilt beyond reasonable doubt and there was no reason to interfere with the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court. aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the high court the $$$ is before us in this appeal. we have heard learned counsel for parties to the lis. learned counsel for the $$$ would submit that the $$$ has been falsely implicated in this case due to prior enmity between him and the superintendent of the department. the counsel further submits that the $$$ was not present in his office on the date of the alleged incident since the said day was a holiday. per contra the respondent -state would support the judgment and order passed by the high court. after going through the judgment and order passed by the high court as well as the trial court and the material on record the $$$ 's case fails to convince us. the source of the prior enmity between the $$$ and the superintendent of the department alleged by the $$$ is a previous incident where the $$$ had refused to give a provisional certificate to ms. uma soumya in whom the superintendent of the department was interested. given this fact it is our opinion that had the prosecution 's case been false then it would have been ms. uma herself who would have filed the allegedly false complaint and not a party. further there is sufficient evidence on record to show that it was common practice among the employees of the concerned university to voluntarily attend the office on $$$$. on the question of sentence learned counsel for the $$$ submits that given the $$$ 's advanced age the fact that the alleged incident occurred in and the fact that the amount involved in the alleged incident was merely the sentence imposed on the $$$ ought to be reduced. however taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence we find that the sentence imposed by the high court is appropriate and can not be further reduced. in light of the aforesaid we are of the considered opinion that in the instant case no good ground exists for our consideration and interference. the appeal being devoid of any merit is liable to be dismissed and is dismissed accordingly. if the appellant is on bail the jurisdictional police authorities are directed to take him into custody within $$$$ month to serve out the remaining part of the sentence awarded by the high court. ordered accordingly.
