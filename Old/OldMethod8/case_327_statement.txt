prosecution case as evident from the order impugned in these appeals is that on 1th july at about.a. nearly persons armed with $$$ a sharped -edged weapon lathi jong etc. entered the house of the complainant -$$$. $$$ -pw. and started breaking the walls of his house and looting his wheat and paddy stored in the same besides a pair of bullocks c.i. sheets. the loot was followed by the house be set on fire destroying the paddy -stocks lying therein. the miscreants are then alleged to have taken away $$$. $$$ $$$. $$$ and $$$. rajab ali tied with a rope to what is known as $$$ river in the neighbourhood of the village where the $$$s herein are alleged to have assaulted them with deadly weapons causing death of $$$. $$$ and $$$. $$$. their dead bodies were then thrown in the river. $$$. rajab ali the brother of the deceased although assaulted with the help of a dao on his head managed to escape and return to his village to inform his father -$$$. $$$ about the incident. the prosecution 's further case is that around.a. on th july a man named $$$ informed the police that some unknown persons all armed with dao lathi spear etc.had trespassed into the house of $$$ at paschim padoghat the inmates of the house and looted away the household articles and also taken away his sons mentid above. on receipt of this information $$$. $$$ assistant sub -inspector posted at panbari o.p. proceeded towards the place of occurrence. on the way he is alleged to have received information that a dead body is lying on the bank of $$$ river. he therefore went to the river side where he was told that the deceased was named $$$ / o. $$$. he conducted an inquest of the dead body upon identification by $$$ not the $$$. while returning with the dead body the officer appears to have discovered another dead body of a youth floating in the river under a tree. he handed over the body to the guard and got the body recovered with the help of the people in the neighbourhood. he held an inquest of the dead body upon its identification as the dead body of$$$ s / o $$$. loading the dead bodies on a handcart the officer is said to have started for the house of the complainant where he recorded the statement of the complainant according to whose version the assault on the village and his house was mounted by the accused persons on a suspicion that the complainant had cut the embankment across the river. it was also reported that the accused had abducted sons of the complainant and killed of them on the bridge over river $$$. the investigation eventually culminated in the filing of a charge -sheet against as many as persons for offences punishable under sections and read with section of indian penal code. of those sent up for trial were declared absconders while the passed away leaving a total of persons who faced the trial before the court of addl. sessions judge $$$ mangaldoi. at the trial the prosecution examined witnesses to prove the charges leveled against the accused persons. the trial court eventually found persons guilty out of them happen to be the appellants before us found who were held guilty of murder and other offences and sentenced to suffer imprisonment for life. the remaining were found guilty for lesser offences punishable under sections read with section of the indian penal code and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for year only. aggrieved by their conviction and the sentences awarded to them the appellants and other convicts preferred criminal appeals which came to be heard by the gauhati high court and disposed of by a common order impugned in the present appeals. the high court reappraised the evidence adduced at the trial and upheld the conviction of the appellant and the sentences awarded to them. criminal appeals no. and of were filed by the co -accused against their conviction for offence punishable under sections read with section of the indian penal code before this court. in addition the appellants filed the present appeals challenging their respective convictions and the sentences awarded to them. by an order dated $$$$ criminal appeals no. and of were disposed of by this court upholding the conviction of the appellants in those appeals but reducing the sentence awarded to them from year to the period already underg. that left only the present appeals filed by appellants before us who were convicted for murder and other offences as already noticed above. since appellant -$$$. $$$ has passed away we are primarily concerned with the conviction of appellants -$$$. $$$ $$$. $$$ $$$. $$$ and $$$. nur alias nurul islam. we have heard $$$ for the parties at considerable length who have taken us through the orders passed by the courts below and the relevant parts of the depositions of the material witnesses including the informant -$$$. $$$ who happens to be the father of the deceased $$$. rajab ali who happens to be injured brother of the deceased musstt. sahar banu the mother of the deceased and musstt. $$$ who happens to be the wife of $$$. rajab ali the injured witness. the incident leading to the alleged commission of the offences can in our opinion be divided into distinct parts. the part of the incident relates to the assault on the home stead of the complainant -$$$. $$$ the breaking of the walls of his house alleged looting of the wheat and paddy bullocks and the burning of the home stead itself. the part of the very same incident relates to the alleged killing of the sons of the complainant -$$$. $$$ by the appellants who were alleged to have been taken away by the deceased to the bridge over $$$ river assaulted with sharp -edged weapons killed and thrown into the river. to the credit of mr. ankoletar gurudatta $$$ for the appellants who appeared as amicus on behalf of the appellants we must mention that the part of the story was not seriously assailed inasmuch as the fact that the appellants were a part of a larger group comprising to persons who appear to have converged at the house of the complainant with a view to causing damage to the house and to set it on fire stands proved. the version of the prosecution witnesses deposing to that part of the case is in our opinion fairly consistent and credible and has been rightly accepted by the courts below. the depositions sufficiently prove that among those who trespassed into the home stead of the complainant were the persons identified by the witnesses and eventually tried and convicted by the courts below. the assailants in that part included the appellants herein. to the extent the said part of the incident has been found proved by both the courts below we see no reason much less a compelling for our interference especially after we have in the accompanying criminal appeals no. and of already affirmed the order of conviction recorded by the courts below qua the appellants in those appeals. the only material difference between the cases of those who were appellants in criminal appeals no. and of and the present appeals is that while the appellants in the said appeals were not convicted for the offence of mischief in the fir punishable under section of the indian penal code appellants -$$$ $$$ and $$$. $$$ have been found guilty of the said offence also and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of years besides fine and default sentence mentid earlier. having regard to the nature of evidence on record we see no reason to interfere with the findings recorded by the courts below insofar as the conviction of appellant -$$$. $$$ who is the only surviving convict of the or the sentence awarded to him under section indian penal code. it follows that to the extent the appellants in the present cases have been convicted for offences punishable under sections and of the indian penal code and in the case of appellant -$$$. $$$ additionally for offence punishable under section of the indian penal code we have no hesitation in affirming the said conviction and the sentence awarded to the appellant. we however have serious doubts about the correctness of the order recorded by the courts below insofar as the offence of murder punishable under section of the indian penal code is concerned. we say so for among others precise reasons. the and the foremost is that although the informant was himself a witness to incident in which the deceased -$$$. $$$ and $$$. $$$ were taken away along with $$$. rajab ali tied with ropes his version before the trial court and the fir lodged by him does not name any of them. nor does it suggest that the deceased were tied with the help of rope or that the deceased and injured -$$$. rajab ali were dragged from the house as is suggested in his sworn testimony before the court. when confronted with this vital omission from the fir the only explanation which the informant has offered is that a white paper was got signed by somebody from him at the arrival of the police in the village. we can not possibly accept that explanation not only because the omission of the names in the fir can not be lightly brushed aside by any such explanation but also because according to the investigating officer upon arrival in the village he had recorded the statement of the informant about the incident. if that were so there is no reason why the informant should not have named the appellants if they had actually carried the deceased boys tied with a rope from his house especially when he was familiar with their names and could identify the culprits. the omission of the names of the appellants from the first information report or from the statement made before the police by the informant in support of the same is significant and casts a serious doubt upon the veracity of the said version. this is particularly so when according to the prosecution 's case $$$. rajab ali the son of the informant who had also been carried along with his brothers by the appellants somehow escaped from the clutches of the appellants ' to run back to the village in an injured condition. $$$. rajab ali 's presence on his return to the village and his passing the information to his father would have necessarily given to his father -the informant as also the police hand information as to what exactly transpired at the bridge over $$$ river. if the police got no clue about what actually happened at the bridge either from the father of the deceased or from $$$. rajab ali their injured brother it could only mean that neither $$$. rajab ali nor the informant had any idea about the deceased having been killed or the persons who killed them. even otherwise there is no reason why the police would not have in the instance itself omitted the names of those responsible for such a ghastly act if the names were actually known or disclosed to them. the and equally important circumstance that affects the credibility of the prosecution case in regard to the killing of the young boys of the informant is that a copy of the first information report was received by the chief $$$ of the area concerned after a period of days or so. there is no explanation forthcoming from the prosecution for the inordinate delay in the dispatch of the copy of the first information report to the jurisdictional court. the and equally significant circumstance is that the statement of $$$. rajab ali who by far is the only witness to the incident of actual killing of the unfortunate boys was according to the said witness recorded months after the occurrence. the witness has on oath stated that he was examined by the police but only months after the incident had taken place. we fail to understand how such a statement can possibly be explained by the prosecution when according to the investigating officer himself the injured -$$$. rajab ali was examined on the date of the occurrence itself. even if for a moment were to ignore the discrepancy in the statement made by the witness and that made by the investigating officer as to the date on which the witness was examined by the police we find that there are material omissions in the statement made by the witness under section of the code of criminal procedure. brought out in the course of his cross -examination which have not been explained by the witness nor by the prosecution. as a matter of fact from the nature of the contradiction and material omission pointed out in the cross -examination it appears that all material parts of the version given by the witness to the police are different from what has been stated before the court. last but not the least is the fact that no independent corroboration of the depositions of $$$. rajab ali 's version. on the contrary there is a material conflict between his version that he was assaulted by a dao a sharp -edged weapon on his head which should in the ordinary course have caused an incised injury of a very serious nature as the alleged weapon is a sharp -edged weapon but has been interestingly found to cause only a simple injury as reported by the doctor who examined the witness. we in the above circumstances the solitary deposition of $$$. rajab ali as to the part of the incident leading to the death of the deceased -$$$. $$$ and $$$. $$$ near the bridge over $$$ river to be reliable hence unsafe for us to base a conviction for a capital offence like murder on the same. in the result we allow these appeals but only in part and to the extent that while the conviction of the appellants for all other offences found proved against them by the courts below shall stand affirmed and so also the sentences awarded to them for each of those offences including fine and default sentence their conviction for the offence of murder punishable under section of the indian penal code and the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to them shall stand set aside giving the appellants benefit of doubt. the appeals are in the above terms allowed in part and disposed of.
