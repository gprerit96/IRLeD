they removed the my the persons locked the manager and the cashier inside the strong room of the bank before escaping in a metallic blue bajaj chetak scooter alongwith the blue colour cash bag. during

qualifying service to enable dk $$$ to get his pension. the tribunal however held that dk $$$ shall not be entitled to any mtary benefit like backwages etc. for the interregnum period except that the same is counted for qualifying service for getting pension. being aggrieved by declining the relief of reinstatement and other mtary benefits dk $$$ has preferred criminal appeals arising out of slp crl.no. -of. $$$ for the appellants and $$$ who appeared in person reiterated the pleas urged before the court martial and the tribunal and submitted that great injustice has been d to the appellants in not following the procedure established by law inasmuch as there was non -compliance of the provisions of section of the identification of prisrs act in taking the fingerprints of the appellants. it was submitted that the photographs of the appellants were taken and were shown to the $$$$ manager and pw- cashier to enable them to identify the appellants -accused without which it would not have been possible for $$$$ and pw- to identify them since even according to the prosecution version when they entered the bank in order to conceal their identity they were wearing helmets and visors. it was submitted that the court martial and the tribunal committed serious error in appreciating the evidence and material on record. per contra learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the case of the appellants have been extensively dealt with by the tribunal and all the questions of law and fact have been considered at length and the tribunal has passed a reasd order wherein all the issues raised by the parties have been considered and the impugned order warrants no interference. in so far as appellant -dk $$$ it was submitted that acquittal in the criminal case does not entitle him for reinstatement as he was not honourably acquitted but was given benefit of doubt and can not claim reinstatement as of right. we have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the impugned judgments and material on record. $$$$ manager and pw- $$$ have clearly spoken about the occurrence that on the date of incident on.persons entered into the bank and threatened $$$$ and pw- by showing gun and committed robbery in the bank. before the court martial $$$$ and pw- have identified the appellants as the culprits who committed robbery in the bank. pw- and pw- have also spoken about the identification parade held in the prison and that they have identified the appellants in the test identification parade. the tribunal disbelieved the evidence of pw- and pw- and their identification of the appellants on the ground that they could not have seen the faces of the culprits at the time of commission of offence since even according to the prosecution the appellants were covering their faces with masks and helmets with visors and they lifted the visors only while conversing with the bank personnel and tribunal held that there was no possibility of pw- manager and pw- $$$ seeing the faces of the accused. the tribunal further relied upon the representation made by the appellants to the metropolitan magistrate that they had been photographed by the police to enable the eye -witnesses pws and to identify them in the test identification parade and on those findings the tribunal disbelieved the evidence of pw- and pw- insofar as the identification of the appellants. the tribunal in our view was not right in disbelieving the evidence of $$$$ manager and pw- $$$ as to the identification of the appellants as the culprits who committed robbery in the bank. the occurrence was at.p. on.. at the time of occurrence the bank personnel including $$$$ and pw- were working and settling the accounts and were about to close the bank. since the bank personnel were still at work in the bank it is reasonable to assume that there was enough light to do so inside the bank. the appellants who entered the bank initially asked $$$$ to open the bank account. before however $$$$ could refuse the appellants took out a revolver and other weapons. from the evidence of $$$$ and pw- it is clear that the incident lasted for a brief period during which the appellants were talking to each other. as per the evidence of $$$$ and pw- while the culprits were so conversing lifting their visors they were able to see the culprits. it is obvious that the extraordinary situation in which the incidence occurred must have left an indelible impression in the mind of the witnesses about the identity of the culprits. be it noted that immediately after the incident $$$$ manager lodged the complaint before malkapuram police station wherein he gave the descriptive particulars of the culprits namely their age height colour complexion etc. and also given the details of the weapons. as noted earlier identity of the appellants by $$$$ and pw- in the court is also corroborated by identification of the appellants by $$$$ and pw- in the test identification parade. in that view the tribunal was not right in disbelieving the evidence of pw- manager and pw- $$$. it is also pertinent to note that pw- and pw- had no reason to falsely implicate the appellants which aspect was not kept in view by the tribunal. to that extent we differ from the findings of the tribunal and accepting the evidence of pw- and pw- and maintain the conviction of appellants -ak $$$ and uk $$$. yet another piece of evidence relied upon by the prosecution is the recovery of weapons from ak $$$. as per the prosecution appellant -ak $$$ was arrested on.and based on his confession the weapons used in the commission of offence were recovered under section of the evidence act. $$$ of the weapons / material objects recovered were produced before the court martial and the tribunal has noted that the photograph of the weapon was taken on.itself as seen from the requisition for taking photo of the weapons. the tribunal therefore disbelieved the prosecution case in so far as the recovery of the weapon used at the time of committing the offence. since we did not have the benefit of perusing the photographs so produced we are not expressing any view about the findings of the tribunal on this aspect. to sustain the conviction of ak $$$ and uk $$$ court martial as well as the tribunal relied upon the evidence of fingerprint $$$pert -v. $$$ pw-15 who had stated that upon information to the control room on.he reached the scene of occurrence at $$$ $$$ $$$ ins virbahu at.p. while examining the scene of occurrence pw-15 observed chance fingerprints on the glass entrance door of the bank. pw-15 developed the same with his universal or white powder and marked them as a and b for the purpose of lifting them by taking photos. as the photographer was not available pw-15 left the scene of occurrence and on $$$$ morning i..at about hrs.pw-15 took the police constable $$$ -photographer of mfsl unit visakhapatnam and photographed the preserved chance fingerprints. the chance fingerprints so lifted were kept in the office of pw-15 for comparison. the police supplied the specimen fingerprints of bank officials for comparison and as per the evidence of pw-15 fingerprints of the bank employees did not tally with the chance fingerprints lifted from the entrance door of the bank. months later after the arrest of the appellants specimen fingerprints of ak $$$ uk $$$ and also dk $$$ were sent to pw-15 for comparison. on comparison pw-15 noted that the chance fingerprint marked a was identical to the specimen right middle finger impression marked as s1 which is the specimen fingerprint of appellant -ak $$$ and the said report was marked as $$$. p-6. in ex. p--report pw-15 opined that chance fingerprint marked b was identical to the specimen right index finger impression as s(a which is the specimen finger impression of appellant -uk $$$. contention of respondents is that evidence of pw-15-fingerprint $$$ incriminates the appellants ak $$$ and uk $$$. however in proving this incriminating evidence there seems to be lapses on the part of the prosecution. as noticed earlier police constable tirumal kumar -photographer of mfsl unit had taken the photographs of the preserved chance fingerprints. to prove the chance fingerprints lifted from the entrance glass doors of the bank the prosecution should have proved the photographs by examining constable -trimul kumar and should have produced the negatives of the photographs of the chance fingerprints. this lapse in the prosecution in our view can not result in acquittal of the appellants. the evidence adduced by the prosecution must be scrutinized independently of such lapses either in the investigation or by the prosecution or otherwise the result of the criminal trial would depend upon the level of investigation or the conduct of the prosecution. criminal trials should not be made casualty for such lapses in the investigation or prosecution. evidence of pw- manager and pw- $$$ identifying the appellants and their evidence as to identity of the appellants in the test identification parade ought not to have been disbelieved by the tribunal. in exercise of power under section of the armed forces tribunal act this court normally does not re -appreciate the evidence and slow to interfere with the findings of the tribunal unless there is substantial question of public importance. but when it is found that appreciation of evidence in a given case is vitiated by serious error this court can re -appreciate the evidence and interfere with the findings. in our view the tribunal was not right in disbelieving the evidence of pw- manager and pw- $$$ in identifying the appellants ak $$$ uk $$$ and dk $$$ as culprits and their identity in test identification parade and their conviction is to be affirmed on the evidence of pw- and pw- if not on the evidence of fingerprint expert and the appeals are liable to be dismissed. in so far as appellant -uk singh prosecution has adduced evidence to show that after the incident he has deposited huge amount in his bank account. pw--gopal priyadarshi assistant central bank of india stated that appellant -uk singh is having account no. in central bank of india azamgarh branch uttar pradesh and that he had deposited rs. on.. ex. p6 is the certificate issued by the central bank azamgarh dated.as per which the last balance in the account of uk singh is rs. including an interest of rs. pw- deposed that as per ex. c- pay in slip the denomination of the cash of rs.  deposited by the accused was bundle of rs. rs. x notes of rs. rs. x total rs. appellant -uk singh has not explained the source of such huge amount deposited in the bank on.which is a strong incriminating circumstance against the appellant. facts leading to dk singh 's arrest are slightly different from those of ak singh and uk singh. dk singh was serving on board alongwith other sailors in ins $$$ visakhapatnam on.. he collected his genform no. dated.from ship ins $$$ at visakhapatnam and proceeded to his next duty station for popti ' q course at ins venduruthy cochin. dk singh alongwith his wife children and brother -in -law proceeded towards his native place by corromandel express. on the basis of information dk singh was arrested at howrah railway station on.was kept under custody till.at calcutta and thereafter he was brought to visakhapatnam on.. in court martial inquiry dk singh was found guilty and sentenced to undergo years rigorous imprisonment and dismissal with disgrace from navy with consequential penalties. upon appeal his conviction was confirmed and sentence was reduced to years. the tribunal acquitted appellant -dk singh by giving him benefit of doubt. while acquitting dk singh tribunal directed that the appellant -dk singh is deemed to have been retired from service with effect from.on completion of qualifying service required for pension. assailing the same appellant -dk singh has filed the appeal seeking for reinstatement and other consequential benefits. as in the case of other appellants tribunal disbelieved the identification of dk singh by pws and. the tribunal accepted dk singh 's plea that his photograph was taken on the same date when he was placed under custody i. on.and identification parade was conducted on.. the tribunal was of the opinion that there was probability for the investigating agency to have shown his photo to pws and. as discussed earlier we have differed from the approach and finding of the tribunal in appreciation of evidence of pw-1 and pw-$$$$ in identifying the appellants. however since union of india has not filed any appeal challenging acquittal of appellant dk singh we do not propose to go into these aspects. it is fairly well settled that acquittal by a criminal court would not debar an employer from exercising power in accordance with the rules and regulations in force. vide $$$ v. general manager pj indian oil corporation ltd.$$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/8/$$$$$$$ / sc/8/$$$$ scc t.n.c.s. corpn. ltd. and ors. v. k. meerabai manu / sc/8/$$$$manu / sc/8/$$$$ scc. acquittal in a criminal case does not entitle a person to automatic reinstatement. in union of india and anr. v. bihari $$$ manu / sc/0909/$$$$manu / sc/0909/$$$$ scc it was held as under:5. it is true that the respondent was acquitted by the criminal court but acquittal does not automatically give him the right to be reinstated into the service. it would still be open to the competent authority to take decision whether the delinquent government servant can be taken into service or disciplinary action should be taken under the central civil services classification control and appeal rules or under the temporary service rules. admittedly the respondent had been working as a temporary government servant before he was kept under suspension. the termination order indicated the factum that he by then was under suspension. it is only a way of describing him as being under suspension when the order came to be passed but that does not constitute any stigma. mere acquittal of government employee does not automatically entitle the government servant to reinstatement. as stated earlier it would be open to the appropriate competent authority to take a decision whether the enquiry into the conduct is required to be done before directing reinstatement or appropriate action should be taken as per law if otherwise available. since the respondent is only a temporary government servant the power being available under rule of the rules it is always open to the competent authority to invoke the said power and terminate the services of the employee instead of conducting the enquiry or to continue in service a government servant accused of defalcation of public money. reinstatement would be a charter for him to indulge with impunity in misappropriation of public money. only if the employee had been honourably acquitted could he make a claim for reinstatement. in the case in hand the tribunal acquitted the appellant -dk singh:(i as in the case of ak singh and uk singh tribunal disbelieved the identification of appellant -dk singh by $$$$ manager and pw-$$$$ $$$ and the weapons that were alleged to have been recovered on the basis of confession of dk singh on.appears to have been photographed on.by the prosecution the tribunal thus rejected the prosecution case that weapons bag and suitcase were recovered on the basis of confession given by dk singh. unlike ak singh and uk singh 's case dk singh did not have incriminating fingerprint evidence at the scene of occurrence and dk singh raised defence plea of alibi. according to dk singh he was on duty along with others on aboard indian naval ship $$$ on.from hours to hours and then again from hours to hours on.. to examine this plea of alibi the tribunal called for the duty ashore book maintained at ins anjadip original of ex. p. dk singh claimed that the document entry at sl. no. was tampered with and consequently tribunal noted that there indeed was some overwriting in sl. no. besides the column for the name of the individual. the tribunal concluded that prosecution had not placed any material on record to show that after finishing his duty at hours appellant -dk singh was allowed to avail off and thus the tribunal concluded that in the absence of evidence that dk singh was allowed to go off after hours on.the benefit of doubt must be afforded to him. the tribunal came to the collective conclusion that no satisfactory evidence had been adduced by the prosecution to sustain the conviction of dk singh and therefore the tribunal set aside the conviction giving him the benefit of doubt. from a perusal of the impugned judgment it is clear that the tribunal has acquitted the appellant -dk singh on the ground that the prosecution has not established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. it is not as if the appellant -dk singh was honourably acquitted. it is also to be pointed out that as discussed above that we have taken the view that the identity of the appellants by pw- manager and pw-$$$$ $$$ is credible and acceptable. evidence of pw- and pw-$$$$ identifying dk singh as of the culprits is a factor to be reckoned with while considering the plea of the appellant -dk singh for reinstatement. additionally it is to be pointed out that as seen from the evidence of k. rama krishna rao -inspector of police pw-17 on.dk singh deposited rs. in his bank account no. of sbi br township branch and the explanation of the appellant for this deposit is not convincing. having regard to our findings on the evidence of pws and the acquittal of appellant -dk singh itself becomes a debatable point. however we do not propose to go into this aspect since the union of india has not filed any appeal challenging acquittal of dk singh. appellant -dk singh who was only granted benefit of doubt can not seek for reinstatement and the consequential benefits and his appeal is also liable to be dismissed. in the result all the appeals are dismissed.
