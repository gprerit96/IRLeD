judgment dated.convicted the $$$ $$$ under section ipc for murder of $$$ and sentenced him to undergo life imprisonment. other accused persons were convicted for murder of $$$ under section ipc read with section ipc and each of them were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. all the persons were convicted under sections ipc for the murder of $$$ and each of them were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. $$$ $$$ and $$$ were also convicted under section ipc. all the accused persons were also convicted under sections ipc. aggrieved by the verdict of conviction the accused persons preferred appeal before the allahabad high court which vide impugned judgment confirmed the conviction of the $$$ -$$$ as awarded by the trial court and partly allowed the appeal qua other accused as aforesaid. this appeal assails the correctness of the impugned judgment. taking us through the evidence and the material on record mr. $$$ learned senior counsel for the $$$ assailed the conviction inter alia on the grounds the discrepancy as to the place of occurrence complainant party were the aggressors and iii conviction of the $$$ could only be under section part ii ipc and not under section ipc. $$$ submitted that the incident took place near the chabutra of $$$ where $$$ and co -accused vakil and hafeez were sitting and not in the place and manner as put forth by the prosecution. it was further submitted that the investigating officer did not find any blood spot at the alleged place of occurrence i. in front of door of $$$. it was further submitted that the accused party were not the aggressors and only deceased $$$ and $$$ were armed with gun and pistol respectively and the investigating officer recovered a gun belonging to the deceased $$$ from the place of occurrence but the prosecution has failed to explain as to how the gun was found there and the material lapses in the prosecution case were not properly appreciated by the high court. per contra mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the trial court rightly convicted the $$$ for committing the murder of $$$ and the high court rightly dismissed the appeal. we have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the impugned judgment and material on record. $$$ and $$$ filed the civil suit no. ex. $$$ alleging that the $$$ $$$ has started construction of his house over the site of $$$. on the application of $$$ the munsif court vide order dated.passed the order of status quo. ex. $$$ is the copy of the commissir 's report and map in the aforesaid suit. ex. $$$ is the application moved by $$$ in the aforesaid suit no. for taking action against the $$$ $$$ under order xxxix rule code of civil procedure which was registered as $$$ no. of and the same was scheduled to be heard on $$$$ of the incident i... by the evidence of $$$$ and by the aforesaid documents prosecution has established the motive of the accused. admittedly the accused persons were close relations of the accused -$$$ hence they also rendered a helping hand in the commission of the crime and all of them formed an unlawful assembly with common intention of inflicting injuries to the complainant party. there is plausible and cogent evidence establishing motive of the accused person for committing the alleged crime. proof of motive of the accused towards the deceased heightens the possibility of the crime. proof of motive adds weight and value to the evidence of the eye -witnesses. prosecution has mainly relied on the testimony of eye -witnesses $$$ $$$$ $$$ pw-$$$$ and $$$ pw-. p.ws. and have spoken in voice about the overt acts of the accused. pw $$$ being injured witness his evidence stands on a higher footing. unless there are cogent and convincing grounds evidence of pw 1-injured witness can not be doubted. pw- 's house is at a distance of to paces towards the west of the house of $$$ and his presence on the spot is quite natural. at the time of occurrence p.ws. and were present in the house of pw and on hearing the hues and cries of the occurrence both of them rushed to the spot and their evidence is fully corroborated by the evidence of$$$. courts below recorded concurrent findings of fact that the evidence of p.ws. and remains unshaken and in spite of lengthy cross -examination of these witnesses the accused were not able to bring any point shaking credibility of p.ws. and. learned senior counsel for the $$$ contended that the $$$ $$$ and the accused party were not the aggressors and that the fateful incident took place near the chabutra of $$$ where co -accused $$$ hafeez were sitting and discussing the strategy of the contempt case listed on.and at that moment deceased $$$ and $$$ armed with gun and pistol respectively along with other accused armed with lathis came there hurling abuses and an altercation took place between both parties and $$$ had given lathi blows to $$$ and hafeez and $$$ fired from his gun and only to show that the accused party were the aggressors the scene of occurrence was shifted as chabutra of $$$. as per prosecution version in the evening of.pw-1 was sitting on the chabutra of the well situated in front of the house of $$$ and the accused party came and fired gunshot injuries and attacked them with lathis. the controversy between the parties is about the exact location of the place of occurrence. admittedly both parties have stated that after the wordy altercation on account of civil dispute the fight ensued between them. $$$ and other witnesses have spoken consistently about the place of occurrence being chabutra of $$$. if the occurrence had taken place at the chabutra of $$$ as alleged by the defence then it was expected that some blood would have been found near the chabutra of the house of $$$ the fact that no blood was found at the chabutra of $$$ improbabilises the defence version. on behalf of the accused it was contended that the complainant party were the aggressors and deceased $$$ and israr armed with gun and pistol respectively along with other persons armed with lathis came to chabutra of $$$ hurling abuses and the complainant gave lathi blows to $$$ and hafeez and $$$ opened fire from his gun as a result of which accused viz. $$$ and hafeez sustained injuries and the prosecution has suppressed genesis of the occurrence. evidence of pw. g.m. solanki of course shows that the accused persons namely $$$. hafeez and $$$ sustained simple injuries ext. $$$ and ka-43. prosecution is obliged to explain injuries sustained by the accused if it is not trivial in nature. the injuries sustained by $$$. hafeez and $$$ were simple injuries. however the prosecution has sufficiently explained the injuries sustained by accused even at the time of registration of the fir as in defence $$$ and $$$ inflicted blows with lathis on the accused party. as discussed earlier the accused party were armed with guns pistols and lathis the injuries sustained by the complainant party and that there were deaths on the side of the complainant party and the injuries sustained by them would clearly prove that the accused party were the aggressors. the truth of the matter is that the accused were the aggressors and the accused $$$ and hafeez khan received minor simple injuries of blunt weapons at the hands of $$$ and $$$ who wielded lathis in lawful exercise of their right of private defence. prosecution version is assailed contending that the prosecution has not explained the recovery of gun from the scene of occurrence. learned senior counsel for $$$ contended that allegedly recovered empty cartridges were sent to ballistic expert -pw who has given a certificate ex. $$$ that of the said cartridges were fired from gun no. -i. the gun allegedly recovered from co -accused $$$ and the cartridge was not fired from either of the guns and in the absence of the recovery of gun the version of the prosecution becomes highly doubtful. be it noted that although it is proved that cartridges were fired from the gun recovered from the accused from the statement adduced by the eye witnesses it is evident that $$$ had a gun and he fired shot from his gun. the said cartridges could have been possibly from the gun of $$$ -abdul waheed which was not recovered. $$$ -recovery of gun from the $$$ nor opinion of ballistic expert regarding cartridges does not in any way raise doubts about the prosecution case and the involvement of the $$$. learned senior counsel mr. $$$ further urged that gun shot fired by the $$$ hit $$$ on his arm which is not a vital part of the body and $$$ can not be held guilty of the murder. by perusal of post -mortem certificate ext. ka-25 it is seen that $$$ sustained following gunshot wound w w b deep on the front and inner side of right upper arm. above elbow with fracture of the shaft of humorous b..multiple gunshot wound of exit of varying dimensions from w w w in middle part of right upper arm with everted margins.abrasion w on the right side of tip of nose.the doctor recovered shots from the wounds and dr. h.d. $$$ opined that the death of the deceased $$$ was due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of injuries sustained by him. the $$$ and the accused party were having enmity against the deceased -$$$ on account of civil suit and filing of contempt petition. the $$$ and the accused party went to chabutra of $$$ armed with pistol guns and lathis which shows the intention of the $$$ to commit the murder. an ordinary person is not presumed to know the precise location of the arteries in the human limbs. therefore if a stab with a knife or dagger aimed at an arm or a leg severs an artery and the injured man dies as a result it may be reasonable to argue that the offence is not of culpable homicide and that the assailant can only be presumed to have intended to cause hurt or grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. the case in hand is quite different. when gun is used and the person who fires the gun must be presumed to have knowledge and intention that he is inflicting an injury which in the ordinary course of nature is sufficient to cause death and the offence is clearly murder. having regard to the enmity and the weapon used the courts below rightly held that the $$$ -accused was guilty of committing the murder of $$$. on behalf of the $$$ it was stated that the occurrence was of the year and the $$$ is aged about years and sending him to prison at this distant point of time would be harsh. we are not impressed with this submission. in the occurrence when persons died and number of others were injured in our view age of the accused is of no relevance. undue sympathy would do more harm to the criminal justice system undermining the public confidence in the efficacy of the system. it is therefore the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the manner in which the offence was committed. the trial court and the high court have recorded concurrent findings and the findings are based upon evidence warranting no interference in exercise of jurisdiction under article of the constitution of india. the appeal is dismissed. $$$ is on bail. his bail bonds are cancelled. he shall be taken into custody forthwith to serve the remaining sentence.
