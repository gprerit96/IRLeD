prafulla c. pant j. leave granted. the question involved in this appeal is whether respondent no. $$$ akola an aghadi or front formed by some of the elected councillors of respondent no. -akola municipal corporation in march without its registration under proviso to section of the maharashtra municipal corporations act for short act stood registered and recognized as a party or group for the purposes of representation and as such whether the petition filed by respondent no. before the high court challenging the standing committee constituted under the act was maintainable. $$$ facts of the case are that elections were held for akola municipal corporation in $$$$ wherein councillors were elected to the house. from amongst elected members initially members and thereafter in all members claimed to have formed an aghadi group of persons with the name $$$ samiti. on.within month of the election leader of the said group submitted an application before the $$$ commissir for its registration under proviso to section of the act. it appears that in the meantime there was a controversy as to whether of the elected members projected to be part of the group were actually members of the aghadi respondent no. or another group akola $$$ present respondent no. the said issue was decided by the high court by a detailed judgment dated.passed in writ petition no. of holding that the aforesaid members were not part of either respondent no. or. $$$ the $$$ commissir passed a detailed order on.whereby the application for registration of respondent no. as aghadi filed in march was rejected. $$$ order was not challenged by any party. however meanwhile resolution dated.was passed by the akola municipal corporation whereby the present appellants and others present $$$. to were nominated in the standing committee as members thereof. the resolution was challenged by $$$. to by filing a $$$ no. of before the nagpur bench of the high court of judicature at bombay. a preliminary objection was raised on behalf of mayor respondent no. before the high court that the writ petition was not maintainable. defending the resolution dated.it was stated that there was no illegality in nominating the members whose names figured in the standing committee constituted vide resolution dated.. after hearing the parties the high court took the view that since the application for registration in the register maintained in form iv as per rule of maharashtra local authority members ' disqualification rules for short rules was made within time the respondent no. should have been treated as separate aghadi and as such non -inclusion of names of its members for proportional representation in the standing committee invalidates the resolution dated.. accordingly the high court quashed the resolution dated.and allowed the writ petition. aggrieved by the above order dated.passed by the high court in $$$ no. of this appeal is filed by the appellants who were $$$. and before the high court through special leave. it is pleaded on behalf of the appellants that the high court has erred in law by accepting the writ petition filed by $$$. to which was not maintainable. it is stated that the high court ignored the fact that vide order dated.the $$$ commissir had rejected the application for registration moved by respondent no. as separate aghadi. it is further pleaded that registration of post -poll group or alliance was mandatory under section a of act read with rules. it is argued before us that unregistered aghadi is not an aghadi in the eyes of law and as such neither the same could have been recognized for its representation in the standing committee nor maintain the writ petition in the high court. on the other hand on behalf of the $$$. to who were the writ petitirs before the high court contended that since there was no rule or procedure prescribed for registration as such their only duty was to intimate the $$$ commissir under rule of rules about the formation of aghadi and the rest was the ministerial work to be completed. the contesting $$$. to placed their reliance in the case of jeevan chandrabhan idnani and anr. v. $$$ commissir $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc. before further discussion we think it just and proper to mention as to what is the meaning of word $$$ and for what purpose it is constituted by the councillors of corporation. $$$ ' aghadi is defined in clause a of section of maharashtra local authority members ' disqualification act for short act which reads as under:. in this act unless the context otherwise requires,-(a)"aghadi or front means a group of persons who have formed themselves into party for the purpose of setting up candidates for election to a local authority. object of allowing elected members to form an aghadi as post -poll alliance is to give proportional representation of its members to the various standing committees constituted for functioning of the corporations.  proviso to sub -section of section a of act allows the councillors to form an aghadi after the election to a municipal corporation. section a reads as under:a. appointment by nomination on committees to be by proportional notwithstanding anything contained in this act or the rules or bye -laws made thereunder in the case of the following committees except where it is provided by this act that the appointment of a councillor to any committee shall be by virtue of his holding any office appointment of councillors to these committees whether in regular or casual vacancies shall be made by the corporation by nominating councillors in accordance with the provisions of sub -section():(a standing committee;(b transport committee;(c any special committee appointed under section any ad hoc committee appointed under section in nominating the councillors on the committee the corporation shall take into account the relative strength of the recognized parties or registered parties or groups and nominate members as nearly as may be in proportion to the strength of such parties or groups in the corporation after consulting the leader of the house the leader of opposition and the leader of each such party or group provided that the relative strength of the recognized parties or registered parties or groups or aghadi or front shall be calculated by dividing the total number of councillors by the total strength of members of the committee. the number of councillors of the recognized parties or registered parties or groups or aghadi or front shall be further divided by the quotient of this division. the figures so arrived at shall be the relative strength of the respective recognized parties or registered parties or groups or aghadi or front. the seats shall be allotted to the recognized parties or registered parties or groups or aghadi or front by considering the whole number of their respective relative strength so ascertained. after allotting the seats in this manner if or more seats remain to be allotted the same shall be allotted each to the recognized parties or registered parties or groups or aghadi or front in the descending order of the fraction number in the respective relative strength starting from the highest fraction number in the relative strength till all the seats are allotted provided further that for the purpose of deciding the relative strength of the recognized parties or registered parties or groups under this act the recognized parties or registered parties or groups or elected councillors not belonging to any such party or group may notwithstanding anything contained in the maharashtra local authority members ' disqualification act mah. xx of within $$$$ month from the date of notification of election results from the aghadi or front and on its registration the provisions of the said act shall apply to the members of such aghadi or front as if it is a registered pre -poll aghadi or front.if any question arises as regards the number of councillors to be nominated on behalf of such party or group the decision of the corporation shall be final. in jeevan chandrabhan idnani supra this court has made following observations interpreting the proviso of sub -section of section. the proviso to sub -section of section -a enables the formation of an aghadi or front within $$$$ month from the date of notification of the election results. such an aghadi or front can be formed by various possible combinations of councillors belonging to either or more registered parties or recognised parties or independent councillors. the proviso categorically stipulates that such a formation of an aghadi or front is possible notwithstanding anything contained in the disqualification act. because an aghadi or front as defined under the disqualification act clearly can only be the combination of a group of persons forming themselves into a party prior to the election for setting up candidates at an election to a local authority but not a combination of political parties or political parties and individuals. therefore the proviso to section of the municipal corporations act which is a later expression of the will of the sovereign in contrast to the stipulation as contained under sections and of the disqualification act would enable the formation of post -electoral aghadis or fronts. however such a formation is only meant for a limited purpose of enabling such aghadis to secure better representation in the various categories of the committees specified under section -a. the compnt parties or individual independent councillors as the case may be in the case of a given front / aghadi do not lose their political identity and merge into the aghadi / front or bring into existence a new political party. there is no merger such as the contemplated under section of the disqualification act. it is further apparent from the language of the proviso that on the formation of such an aghadi or front the same is required to be registered. the procedure for such registration is contained in the maharashtra local authority members ' disqualification rules. once such an aghadi is registered by a legal fiction created under the proviso such an aghadi is treated as if it were a pre -poll aghadi or front. the proviso further declares that once such a registration is made the provisions of the disqualification act apply to the members of such post -poll aghadi. we do not propose to examine the legal consequences of such a declaration as it appears from the record that a complaint has already been lodged against respondents to herein under the provisions of the disqualification act. the limited question before us is whether the respondent was legally right in registering an aghadi or front formed after the lapse of month from the date of the notification of the election results.xxx0. in substance the high court held that the interpretation of section -a depends upon the tenor and scheme of the subordinate legislation. such a principle of statutory construction is not normally resorted to save in the case of interpretation of an old enactment where the language is ambiguous. we are conscious of the fact that there is some difference of opinion on this principle but for the purpose of the present case we do not think it necessary to examine the proposition in detail as in our opinion the language of section -a is too explicit to require any other external aid for the interpretation of the same. subordinate legislation made by the executive in exercise of the powers delegated by the legislature at best may reflect the understanding of the executive of the scope of the powers delegated. but there is no inherent guarantee that such an understanding is consistent with the true meaning and purport of the parent enactment. such variations of the relative strength of aghadis would have various legal consequences provided under the disqualification act. depending upon the fact situation in a given case the variation might result in the consequence of rendering some of the councillors disqualified for continuing as councillors. section -a of the municipal corporation act only enables the formation of an aghadi or front within $$$$ from the date of the notification of the results of the election to the municipal corporation. to permit recognition of variations in the relative strength of the political parties beyond the abovementid period of month would be plainly in violation of the language of the proviso to section -a. we have already discussed that an aghadi formed after election is required to be registered as provided in sub -section of section a of act. rule of rules which relates to maintaining a register of information as to councilors and members provides as under register of information as to councilors or members.the commissir in the case of a councilor of a municipal corporation and the $$$ in the case of any other councilor or member shall maintain in form iv a register based on the information furnished under rules and in relation to the councilor of a municipal party zilla parishad party or as the case may be member of a panchayat samiti party. there is no detailed procedure prescribed for registration of an aghadi. it is evident from rule quoted above that power to register vests with the commissir. the word commissir is defined in clause c of rule of act and the same is reproduced below:(c commissir means the commissir of a revenue division appointed under section of the maharashtra land revenue code. in earlier round respondent no. filed writ petition no. of challenging resolution dated.passed in the general body meeting of akola municipal corporation which was decided by the high court with the following concluding paragraphs:0. this discussion leads to conclusion that $$$. & could not have been treated as members either of respondent no. or then of the $$$. the proportionate representation of the $$$ & respondent no. on standing committee needed to be worked out by ignoring them. the $$$ therefore is rightly given members. but then there has to be proportionate reduction in representation allotted to respondent. strength of respondent no. in general body of is. it therefore gets.seats in standing committee i. seats. seat remains vacant and decision about it can not be taken as respondent no. $$$ commissir has still not completed his exercise of verification. first proviso to section does not prohibit corporation from filling in such vacancy by nominating on the committee any member not belonging to any such party or group. if no such member is available $$$. to as also $$$ have to start working with standing committee of members only & continue till the respondent no. decides on the validity of change or then status of $$$. &. it is settled position that law does not expect compliance with the impossibilities. holding of a general body meeting for this limited purpose is essential. if respondent finds $$$. & not disqualified corporation can thereafter proceed to fill in the vacancy. accordingly respondent no. aghadi as also $$$. & are directed to bring down representation of respondent no. on standing committee from to. proceedings and meeting conducted on.are quashed & set -aside to that extent. $$$. & to hold a general body meeting to bring down the strength of representatives of respondent no. from to. respondent corporation is free to fill in resulting vacancy by nominating on the standing committee a councillor as per proviso to section of the corporation act in this meeting. $$$ general body meeting be held within period of weeks from $$$$. if seat in standing committee can not be filled in the

gone through the above documents. order dated.passed by divisional commissioner amravati whereby the application for registration was disposed of shows that the application of the writ petitioners was rejected as affidavits of sanjay babulal badone respondent no. and smt. madhuri sanjay badone were not complete. the who were elected from prabhag no. and prabhag no. as independent candidates failed to file any document to show as to which group they belonged. their names figured in groups. in the order dated.the divisional commissioner also referred to a serious infirmity in accepting the proposal as he found that the affidavit was sworn to and attested on.whereas the stamps were purchased on.which the divisional commissioner held to be an incomprehensible act of the proposer. such serious infirmities which weighed with the divisional commissioner in passing the order of rejection dated.can not be found fault with. considering the scheme of the rules we are convinced that it was incumbent upon the divisional commissioner to hold a meaningful exercise of scrutinizing the proposal for registration and pass a positive order of registration and then alone the exception carved out under section of the act even for the limited purpose to get rid of disqualification under the rules can be allowed to operate. viewed in that respect also the order dated.assumes greater significance and therefore unless and until the said order was set aside in the manner known to law the formation of the aghadi as claimed by the first respondent could not have come into effect. it is not disputed that no one challenged the order dated.passed by the divisional commissioner as such the same has attained finality. that being so the mahanagar sudhar samiti akola respondent no. can not be said to be a registered group as required under proviso of sub -section of section 3a of the act of. in our opinion the high court has erred in law by ignoring the above order of the divisional commissioner and holding that respondent no. stood registered. if there was objection to registration of an aghadi on the ground that names of certain members were falsely or wrongly shown in the list the commissioner had no option but to verify the same. and in such cases unless the verification is done an aghadi can not be said to have got registered by merely submitting an application within month of election to municipal corporation. had the writ petitioners challenged order dated.passed by the divisional commissioner with the resolution dated.the situation would have been different. but in the present case order of divisional commissioner rejecting application for registration has attained finality and same can not be ignored. as such writ petition filed by $$$. to questioning validity of resolution dated.was liable to be dismissed. therefore this appeal deserves to be allowed. accordingly the appeal is allowed and impugned order dated.passed by the high court in writ petition no. of is hereby set aside and the resolution dated.shall stand restored. no orders as to costs.
