s.n. variava j. these appeals are against an order dated th october passed by the customs excise and gold control appellate tribunal hereinafter called the tribunal. briefly stated the facts are as follows:3. the $$$s are engaged in construction activities. as part of their business they crush boulders into bajari which is then used in the construction work. the $$$s did not consider the activities of crushing boulders into bajari to be a manufacturing activity. they therefore did not apply for any licence nor paid excise duty. on 2th february a show cause notice was issued to them demanding duty of rs. on the crushed bajari for the period october to january. another show cause notice was issued to them on may demanding duty of rs. for the period 1st april to 30th september. the $$$s filed a reply to both the notices. on 14th june the assistant collector central excise confirmed the demand and also imposed a penalty of rs. on 1th november the collector appeals confirmed the order of the assistant collector. the $$$s therefore filed an appeal before the tribunal. by the impugned judgment the appeal has been dismissed. questions were raised before the tribunal viz.whether the activity of crushing boulders into bajari amounts to manufacture and whether the bajari is a new product having a distinct name character or use and whether the respondent could have invoked the extended period of limitation under section a for the demand sic the show cause notice dated may. we will first take up the question. the law on this point is well -settled. in the case of padmini products v. collector of central excise reported in manu / sc/033/1manu / sc/033/1 this court has held that wherever there is no scope for believing that the goods are not excisable to duty and therefore no licence is required to be taken out then the extended period of limitation for demand under section a is inapplicable. this court has held that mere failure or negligence on the part of the manufacturer in not taking out a licence and in not paying duty does not attract the extended period of limitation. this court has held that there must be evidence to show that the manufacturer knew that the goods were liable to duty and that he was required to take out a licence. this court has held that for invoking the extended period of limitation duty should not have been paid short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded because of either fraud collusion wilful mis -statement suppression of fact or contravention of any provision or rules. this court has held that these ingredients postulate a positive act and therefore mere failure to pay duty and/or take out a licence which is not due to any fraud collusion or willful mis -statement or suppression of fact or contravention of any provision is not sufficient to attract the extended period of limitation. mr. sridharan advocate or the $$$ has apart from this authority also relied upon number of other authorities wherein the tribunal has taken an identical view. in our view the law having been settled by this court it is not necessary to refer to the decisions of the tribunal. as the decisions have been cited we merely set out the citations viz.a manu / ce/067/16manu / ce/067/16 tri -hindustan construction co. v. cce $$$ / ce/018/14manu / ce/018/14.tri -jaypee rewa cement v. cce raipur.rlt cegat -$$$ v. cce raipur.rlt tri -new vikram cement v. cce indore.manu / cc/0043/18manu / $$$ lime products v. cce adras. in this case there was a divergent view of the various high courts whether crushing of bigger stones or boulders into smaller pieces amounts to manufacture. in view of the divergent views of the various high courts there was a bona fide doubt as to whether or not such an activity amounted to manufacture. this being the position it can not be said that merely because the appellants did not take out a licence and did not pay the duty the provisions of section a got attracted. there is no evidence or proof that the licence was not taken out and/or duty not paid on account of any fraud collusion willful mis -statement or suppression of fact. we therefore set aside the demand under the show cause notice dated 3rd may. as regards the demand under the show cause notice dated 26th february mr. sridharan states that the appellant has already paid the amount. he states that he is not pressing this appeal in respect of the demand under that show cause notice. thus we see no reason to decide the other question viz.whether crushing of stoned amounts to manufacture and whether a new product has come into existence. we leave this question open. the appeals stand disposed of accordingly. there will be no order as to costs.
