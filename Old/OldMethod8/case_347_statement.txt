g.p. mathur j. this appeal has been preferred by the complainant informant against the judgment and order dated.of the high court of punjab & haryana by which the appeal preferred by the accused -respondent was allowed and the judgment and order dated.of additional sessions judge $$$ by which they had been convicted and sentenced was set aside. the learned additional sessions judge had convicted accused $$$ under section ipc and the remaining accused namely balwinder $$$ avtar $$$ and $$$ under section read with section ipc and had sentenced each of them to imprisonment for life and a fine of rs. and in default to undergo months rigorous imprisonment. the accused were further convicted under section ipc and were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for years and a fine of rs. each and in default to undergo months rigorous imprisonment. all the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. the case of the prosecution in brief is that at about.p. on.the complainant. $$$ along will his sons lakha $$$ $$$ and bhan $$$ and others namely $$$ and pritam $$$ was coming towards his outer house after having unloaded the trolley of wheat straw. when they were at a distance of about -karams from the $$$ of gurdial $$$ they saw that accused balwinder $$$ a- and avtar $$$ a- armed with sbbl guns and accused $$$ a- and $$$ a- armed with dbbl guns were standing there. a- entered the $$$ and fired a short towards them through the iron gauze of the window which hit $$$. $$$ a- fired a shot which hit laksha $$$ on his face and left side of the neck and right hand and a short which hit $$$. a- fired a shot which hit bhan $$$ and a shot which hit $$$. a- fired a shot which hit pritam $$$. $$$ the accused ran away. $$$ then carried lakha $$$ to his outer house and all the injured persons also reached there. the injured persons were then taken to bus stand $$$ in the tractor trolley of major $$$ where they hired taxies on which they proceeded to christian medical college $$$ where they were admitted at about.p. on . lakha $$$ succumbed to his injuries at about.a. on.. information was then sent from the hospital to s.h.o. division no.$$$ and thereafter pw $$$ s.i. police station. $$$ came there and recorded the statement of $$$. this was sent to ps $$$ through $$$ $$$ and a formal fir was recorded at.p. after investigation charge sheet was submitted against the accused -respondents and in due course they were committed to the court of sessions. during the course of trial the prosecution examined in all witnesses including witnesses of the occurrence and filed some documentary evidence. the accused in their statement under section cr.p.c. denied the case of the prosecution and pleaded that they had been falsely implicated. the defence of a- was that there was some dispute regarding passage between $$$ and $$$ and in the said case his father had appeared as a witness against the former. he further pleaded that he had contested the election for the office of sarpanch against hari $$$ in which a- was polling agent of hari $$$ and that a- was removed from service on his complaint regarding embezzlement. he thus submitted that he had strained relations with a- and a- and as such he could not have joined with them in the commission of the crime. the accused examined witnesses namely dw- $$$ dw- $$$ and dw- $$$ in their defence. the learned sessions judge believed the case of the prosecution and convicted and sentenced the accused as mentid earlier. the appeal preferred by the accused -respondents was allowed by the high court and their conviction and sentence was set aside. the main grounds which weighed with the high court in allowing the appeal are that there was delay in lodging the fir that injured persons and ramesh whose name is mentid in the fir were not examined as witnesses by the prosecution and that the investigation of the case was tainted. before examining the contention raised by learned counsel for the parties it is necessary to briefly refer to the evidence which has been adduced by the prosecution. pw dr. d.s. mohan medical officer cmc hospital $$$ admitted all the injured namely $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ in the casualty ward on.. pw dr. $$$. masish registrar department of surgery cmc $$$ medically examined pw $$$ at.p. on.and found multiple pellet injuries in number on lower abdomen and also multiple pellet injuries on right fore -arm and right leg. on internal examination he found multiple small holders in the terminal ileum and preformation in caceum. $$$ was discharged from hospital on.after a surgery had been performed. the same doctor medically examined $$$ at.a. in of.and found pellet injuries on right hand and on epigastrium region. in the opinion of the doctor the injuries no. and of pw $$$ were dangerous to life and duration of injuries sustained by both the injured was fresh. pw dr. a.s. $$$ has proved the injury report of $$$ who was admitted in the casualty ward at.p. on.and also the injury report of $$$. pw dr. $$$ t.$$$ examined $$$ and $$$ from.a. onwards in of.. $$$ had sustained gun -shot injuries on left thigh while $$$ had sustained a gun shot wound on his right fore -arm. pw dr. $$$ radiologist conducted x -ray examination of the injuries of the injured $$$ lakha $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ and has proved the x -ray examination reports prepared by him. lakha $$$ succumbed to his injuries at about.a. on.. pw dr. virinder kappal medical officer civil hospital $$$ conducted post -mortem examination on the body of the deceased at.p. on.and found gun shot wounds on different parts of the body. the internal examination showed that injury no.had perforated the frontal b and a pellet was recovered from right cerebral cortex. pellet had entered through the angle of the mandible and had fractured brain stem entering the skull and it was found embedded in the brain matter. there was laceration of the durameter and the brain matter. pellets had also entered the chest wall and were found in the lower lobe of right lung. according to doctor the death had occurred due to injuries on vital organs namely brain and lung and they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death individually and collectively. thus the medical evidence on record shows that persons received gun shot injuries in the incident out of whom the injuries to lakha $$$ proved fatal and the injuries sustained by pw $$$ were dangerous to life. he was operated upon and was discharged from the hospital after days on.. coming to the ocular testimony the prosecution examined injured witnesses namely $$$ pw $$$ and pw $$$. in his statement in $$$ corroborated the version given by him in the fir and stated that jangir $$$ had previously given his land for cultivation to a- and a- on crop sharing basis but $$$$ he gave his land to him due to which the accused were aggrieved. he has further stated that at about.p. on.he was coming to his inner house after unloading the trolley of what straw along with his sons lakha $$$ $$$ and $$$ and also $$$ and $$$. when he was at a distance of -karams from the $$$ of gurdial $$$ he saw accused a- and a- armed with sbbl guns and a- and a- armed with dbbl guns standing in front of the $$$ of gurdial $$$. a- then entered the $$$ and fired a shot through the iron gauze of the window which hit $$$. the shot fired by a- hit lakha $$$ on his face and the shot fired by him hit him on him arm and head. a- fired a shot which hit $$$ and another shot fired by him hit $$$. $$$ a- fired a short which hit $$$. after causing the injuries the accused ran away lakha $$$ had fallen down and was removed to the house. all the injured were brought to bus stand $$$ by $$$ in a tractor trolley where they hired taxies and proceeded to cmc $$$ where they were admitted in . pw $$$ and $$$ have given similar version of the incident and have fully corroborated the testimony of $$$. dw sandhu $$$ and dw ram $$$ have deposed that s.i. $$$ took away their guns and dw $$$ has merely stated that panchayat election is held under his supervision. the learned sessions judge after placing reliance on the testimony of the eye -witnesses and the medical evidence on record was of the opinion that the case of the prosecution was fully established. surprisingly the high court did not at all consider the testimony of the eye witnesses and completely ignored the same. section cr.p.c. empowers the appellate court to dismiss the appeal summarily if it considers that there is no sufficient ground for interference. section cr.p.c. lays down the procedure for hearing appeal not dismissed summarily and sub -section thereof casts an obligation to send for the records of the case and to hear the parties. section cr.p.c. lays down that after perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his pleader and the public prosecutor the appellate court may in an appeal from conviction reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be re -tried by a court of competent jurisdiction. it is therefore mandatory for the appellate court to peruse the record which will necessarily mean the statement of the witnesses. in a case based upon direct eye -witness account the testimony of the eye -witnesses is of paramount importance and if the appellate court reverses the finding recorded by the trial court and acquits the accused without considering or examining the testimony of the eye -witnesses it will be a clear infraction of section cr.p.c. in biswanath ghosh v. state of west bengal and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ crilj2 it was held that where the high court acquitted the accused in appeal against conviction without waiting for arrival of records from the sessions court and without perusing evidence adduced by prosecution there was a flagrant mis -carriage of justice and the order of acquittal was liable to be set aside. it was further held that the fact that the public prosecutor conceded that there was no evidence was not enough and the high court had to satisfy itself upon perusal of the records that there was no reliable and credible evidence to warrant the conviction of the accused. in state of up v. sahai and ors. $$$ / sc/02/$$$ / sc/02/ it was observed that where the high court has not cared to examine the details of the intrinsic merits of the evidence of the eye -witnesses and has rejected their evidence on the general grounds the order of acquittal passed by the high court resulted in a gross and substantial mis -carriage of justice so as to invoke extra -ordinary jurisdiction of supreme court under article of the constitution. in the present case the incident took place at about.p. on.. on $$$$ may the sun sets fairly late and there is good light at.p. and as such the witnesses must have seen and identified the assailants who were all residents of the same village $$$ and were very well known to them. the eye -witnesses examined by the prosecution namely $$$ pw $$$ and pw $$$ are injured witnesses and therefore no doubt can be raised about their presence on the spot. they have given a consistent version that a- and a-2 were armed with sbbl guns and a- and a- were armed with dbbl guns and that all the accused fired from their respective weapons causing injuries to them and also to $$$ $$$ and the deceased lakha $$$. thus the evidence on record fully establishes the case of the prosecution. the main reason given by the high court for disbelieving the prosecution case is that though the incident took place at.p. on.but the fir was recorded at.p. on.at the police station and the special report reached the magistrate at.p. and as the distance of the police station $$$ from the place of occurrence is only kilometres there was inordinate delay in lodging the fir which rendered the prosecution case doubtful. in our opinion in the facts and circumstances of the case the view taken by the high court that there was inordinate delay in lodging the fir is not correct. in the incident in question besides the informant $$$ his sons namely lakha $$$ $$$ and $$$ and others $$$ and pritam $$$ had received injuries. the condition of lakha $$$ was serious as he had received injuries on his chest neck and brain and the injuries received by $$$ were also grievous and dangerous to life. naturally the anxiety of the injured would have been to rush to the hospital to get immediate medical aid and to save their life. pw has stated that $$$ is -kilometres from his village and he reached the bus stand there at about.p. on the tractor of major $$$ and from there he hired taxies for going to $$$. he reached $$$ which is kilometres from $$$ at about.p. and all the injured were admitted in the hospital at about.p. though medical aid was provided to his son lakha singh but he died at about.a. on.. the condition of his another son pw7 $$$ was also serious. pw dr. $$$. masish has stated that injuries no.and of $$$ were dangerous to life. his statement also shows that $$$ was operated upon and ultimately he was discharged from the hospital on.. the record shows that some information was sent from cmc hospital to police division no. in $$$ which is at a distance of about kilometers after the death of lakha singh in of.. $$$ a wireless message was sent to police station $$$. $$$ si them proceeded from $$$ for $$$ at about.a. and after reaching the hospital he moved an application before the emo cmc hospital requesting that it may be informed whether statement of the witnesses can be recorded. dr. $$$ then gave in writing that $$$ was in fit condition to give his statement. it was thereafter that pw4 $$$ s.i.recorded the statement of $$$ at about.p. this statement in writing was sent to ps $$$ through $$$ $$$ on the basis of which pw7 om prakash sho $$$ recorded the fir exh. pj/2 at.p. on.. the high court merely said that as the place of occurrence is only kilometers from the police station and the fir was lodged after hours the delay in lodging thereof has rendered the prosecution case doubtful. the sequence of events and the manner in which the fir was lodged have not at all been taken into consideration. it is quite likely that $$$ was too shocked to think about the lodging of the fir. his only anxiety must have been to anyhow rush to the hospital to save the lives of his sons. it is noteworthy that he did not go to any nearby dispensary or an ordinary hospital but went to a good medical college hospital which was at $$$ to get the best possible treatment. in he and his other relations must have been too involved in looking after the injured persons some of whom were fighting for their life. time must have been taken by both pw4 $$$ si to reach $$$ from $$$ and thereafter by $$$ $$$ in carrying the statement of $$$ from cmc $$$ to ps $$$. in these circumstances there was hardly any delay in lodging of the fir at the police station. the special report of the occurrence was sent to cjm $$$ within hours and minutes of the lodging of the fir. the special report was therefore sent very promptly and it can not be said by any stretch of imagination that there was any delay in sending the same. the high court has went to the extent of observing that the delay of hours in sending the special report by itself was enough to allow the appeal and to set aside the conviction of the accused. in our opinion the period which elapsed in loding the fir of the incident has been fully explained from the evidence on record and no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution merely on the ground that the fir was lodged at.p. on $$$$. there is no heard and fast rule that any delay in loding the fir would automatically render the prosecution case doubtful. it necessarily depends upon facts and circumstances of each case whether there has been any such delay in lodging the fir which may cast doubt about the veracity of the prosecution case and for this a host of circumstances like the condition of the informant the nature of injuries sustained the number of victims the efforts made to provide medical aid to them the distance of the hospital and the police station etc. have to be taken into consideration. there is no mathematical formula by which an inference may be drawn either way merely on account of delay in loding of the fir. in this connection it will be useful to take note of the following observation made by this court in tara singh & ors. v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/006/$$$ / sc/006/ $$$ the delay in giving the fir by itself can not be a ground to doubt the prosecution case. $$$ the indian conditions as they are can not expect these villagers to rush to the police station immediately after the occurrence. human nature as it is the kith and kin who have witnessed the occurrence can not be expected to act mechanically with all the promptitude in giving the report to the police. at times being grief -stricken because of the calamity it may not immediately occur to them that they should give a report. after all it is but natural in these circumstances for them to take some time to go the police station for giving the report. of course in cases arising out of acute factions their is a tendency to implicate persons belonging to the opposite faction falsely. in order to avert the danger of convicting such innocent persons the courts should be cautious to scrutinise the evidence of such interested witnesses with greater care and caution and separate grain from the chaff after subjecting the evidence to a closer scrutiny and in doing so the contents of the fir also will have to be scrutinised carefully. however unless there are indications of fabrication the court can not reject the prosecution version as given in the fir and later substantiated by the evidence merely on the ground of delay. these are all matters for appreciations and much depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. in zahoor and ors. v. state of u.p.$$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ it was held that mere delay by itself is not enough to reject the prosecution case unless there are clear indications of fabrication. this was reiterated in jamna and ors. v. state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/0022/4$$$ / sc/0022/4 air4sc7 that delay by itself is not a circumstance to doubt the prosecution case. in the present case the high court did not at all take into consideration the fact that the informant $$$ and his sons besides others had received injuries and they had g to $$$ from their village on a tractor trolley and from there to cmc. $$$ on taxies which is about kilometres and further that all the injured had been admitted in the hospital where of them died and another namely pw7 $$$ had sustained serious injuries which were dangerous to life and he had to be operated upon and in such circumstances he could not have left the hospital for going to ps sangrur for loding the fir. the high court also failed to take into consideration the fact that the fir was lodged after pw $$$ si. of police station sangrur had come to the hospital and had recorded the statement of $$$ after seeking opinion of the doctor in writing and thereafter the said statement was sent through $$$ to the police station sangrur. we are therefore clearly of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the case there was no delay in either loding of the fir or in sending the special report to the cjm and the view to the contrary taken by the high court is absolutely incorrect. the high court has also held that the details about the occurrence were not mentid in the inquest report which showed that the investigating officer was not sure of the facts when the inquest report was prepared and this feature of the case carried weight in favour of the accused. we are unable to accept this reasoning of the high court. the provision for holding of an inquest and preparing an inquest report is contained in section cr.p.c. the heading of the section is police to enquire and report on suicide etc.sub -section of this section provides that when the officer in charge of a police station or some other police officer specially empowered by the state government in that behalf receives information that a person has committed suicide or has been killed by another or by an animal or by machinery or by an accident or has died under circumstances raising a reasonable suspicion that some other person has committed an offence he shall immediately give information to the nearest executive magistrate and shall proceed to the place where the body of such deceased person is and there in the presence of or more respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood shall make an investigation and raw up a report of the apparent cause of death describing such wounds fractures bruises and other marks or injury as may be found on the body and stating in what manner or by what weapon or instrument if any such marks appear to have been inflicted. the requirement of the section is that the police officer shall record the apparent cause of death describing the wounds as may be found on the body and also the weapon or instrument by which they appear to have been inflicted and this has to be d in the presence of or more respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood. the section does not contemplate that the manner in which the incident took place or the names of the accused should be mentid in the inquest report. the basic purpose of holding an inquest is to report regarding the apparent cause of death namely whether it is suicidal homicidal accidental or by some machinery etc. the scope and purpose of section cr.p.c. was explained by this court in podda narayana and ors. v. state of andhra pradesh $$$ / sc/02/5$$$ / sc/02/5 air5sc1252 and it will be useful to reproduce the same.the proceedings under section have a very limited scope. the object of the proceedings is merely to ascertain whether a person has died under suspicious circumstances or an unnatural death and if so what is the apparent cause of the death. the question regarding the details as to how the deceased was assaulted or who assaulted him or under what circumstances he was assaulted is foreign to the ambit and scope of the proceedings under section. neither in practice nor in law was it necessary for the police to mention those details in the inquest report.it is therefore not necessary to enter all the details of the overt acts in the inquest report. their omission is not sufficient to put the prosecution out of court. in khujji alias surendra tiwari v. state of madhya pradesh $$$ / sc/04/$$$ / sc/04/ this court after placing reliance upon the above quoted decision rejected the contention raised on behalf of the accused that the evidence of eye -witnesses could not be relied upon as their names did not figure in the inquest report prepared at the earliest point of time. in $$$ v. nausher gama & anr. $$$ / sc/08/5$$$ / sc/08/5 air5sc1324 it was held that an inquest under section cr.p.c. is concerned with establishing the cause of death only. the high court was therefore clearly in error in holding that as the facts about the occurrence were not mentid in the inquest report it would show that at least by the time the report was prepared the investigating officer was not sure of the facts of the case. the and the last reasoning given by the high court in acquitting the accused is that the investigation of the case tainted and for coming to this conclusion circumstances have been taken into account. the circumstance is that pw om prakash inspector police station sangrur did not take into possession the wire gauze of the window of $$$ from where a-1 is alleged to have fired his gun. the circumstance is that the investigation officer did not send the fire arms and the empties recovered from the spot for comparison to the forensic science laboratory and the is that in the daily diary register ddr the names of the witnesses weapons of offence and the place of occurrence were not mentid. coming to the last point regarding certain omissions in the ddr it has come in evidence that on the basis of the statement of $$$ which was recorded by pw14 $$$ s.i. in the hospital a formal fir was recorded at the police station at.p. in accordance with section cr.p.c. the contents of the fir were also entered in the ddr which contained the names of the witnesses weapons of offence and place of occurrence and it was not very necessary to mention them separately all over again. it is not the case of the defence that the names of the accused were not mentid in the ddp. we fail to understand as to how it was necessary for the investigation officer to take in his possession the wire gauze of the window from where a-1 is alleged to have fired. the wire gauze and absolutely no bearing on the prosecution case and the investigating officer was not supposed to cut and take out the same from the window where it was fixed. it would have been certainly better if the investigating agency had sent the fire arms and the empties to the forensic science laboratory for comparison. however the report of the ballistic expert would in any case be in the nature of an expert opinion and the same is not conclusive. the failure of the investigating officer in sending the fire arms and the empties for comparison can not completely throw out the prosecution case when the same is fully established from the testimony of eye -witness whose presence on the spot can not be doubted as they all received gun shot injuries in the incident. in karnel singh v. state of m.p. $$$ / sc/047/5$$$ / sc/047/5 it was held that in cases of defective investigation the court has to be circumspect in evaluating the evidence but it would not be right in acquitting an accused person solely on account of the defect and to do so would tantamount to playing into the hands of the investigating officer if the investigation is designedly defective. in $$$ and ors. v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/000/$$$ / sc/000/ while commenting upon certain omissions of the investigating agency it was held that it may be that such lapse is committed designedly or because of negligence and hence the prosecution evidence is required to be examined de hors such omissions to find out whether the said evidence is reliable or not. similar view was taken in $$$ v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0302/8$$$ / sc/0302/8 when this court observed that in such cases the story of the prosecution will have to be examined de hors such omissions and contaminated conduct of the officials otherwise the mischief which was deliberately d would be perpetuated and justice would be denied to the complainant party and this would obviously shake the confidence of the people not merely in the law enforcing agency but also in the administration of justice. in our opinion the circumstances relied upon by the high court in holding that the investigation was tainted are not of any substance on which such an inference could be drawn and in a case like the present where the prosecution case is fully established by the direct testimony of the eye -witnesses which is corroborated by the medical evidence any failure or omission of the investigating officer can not render the prosecution case doubtful or unworthy of belief. another reason given by the high court for acquitting the accused- respondents is that other injured witnesses namely $$$ and pritam singh and ramesh whose name was mentid in the fir were not examined. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the accused -respondents has vehemently urged that the purpose of a criminal trial is not to support the prosecution theory but to investigate the offence and to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused and the duty of the public prosecutor is to represent the administration of justice and therefore the testimony of all the available eye witnesses should be before the court and in support of this contention he has placed reliance on state of u.p & anr. v. jaggo alias jagdish & ors. $$$ / sc/00/71$$$ / sc/00/71. it is true that the witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based must be called by the prosecution whether effect of their testimony is for or against the case of the prosecution. however that does not mean that everyone who has witnessed the occurrence whatever their number be must be examined as a witness. the prosecution in the present case had examined eye -witnesses who were all injured witnesses. the mere fact that $$$ and pritam singh were not examined can not lead to an inference that the prosecution case was not correct. the aforesaid witnesses had been given up by the prosecution on the ground that they had been won over by the accused. these persons are not family members of the informant $$$ and it is quite likely that they did not want to get involved in any dispute between the informant and his son on the hand and the accused on the other hand as they had no interest in the land belonging to $$$ sadh which was being earlier cultivated by gurdial singh father of a-1 and a-2 but had been taken $$$$ by the informant $$$. the contention raised by learned counsel fails to take notice of section of the evidence act which provides that no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. a similar contention has been repelled by this court in a very illustrating judgment in vadivelu thevar v. state of madras manu / sc/003/57manu / sc/003/57 and it will be useful to take note of para of the report which reads as under...the contention that in a murder case the court should insist upon plurality of witnesses is much too broadly stated. the indian legislature has not insisted on laying down any such exceptions to the general rule recognised in section which by laying down that no particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact has enshrined the well recognised maxim that evidence has to be weighed and not counted.it is not seldom that a crime has been committed in the presence of only witness leaving aside those cases which are not of uncommon occurrence where determination of guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. if the legislature were to insist upon plurality of witnesses cases where the testimony of a single witness only could be available in proof of the crime would go unpunished.... the above quoted principle was laid reiterated in ramratan & ors. v. state of rajasthan manu / sc/0138/61manu sc/0138/61. the prosecution having examined eye -witnesses in our opinion there was no necessity of multiplying the number of witnesses and no adverse inference could be drawn against the prosecution merely on the ground that $$$ or pritam singh were not examined. if the incident had not taken place as suggested by the prosecution but had happened in a different manner there was no impediment in the way of the accused -respondents to examine the aforesaid persons as defence witnesses but they did not chose to do so. having given our careful consideration to the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties we are of the opinion that the judgment and order of the high court is wholly perverse and illegal inasmuch as it completely failed to consider the testimony of the eye -witnesses and the reasons given for discarding the prosecution case are also unsustainable in law. in the result the appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. the judgment and order dated.of the high court is set aside and that of the learned additional sessions judge sangrur is restored. the accused -respondents shall surrender forthwith to undergo the sentences imposed upon them by the learned additional sessions judge. the chief judicial magistrate sangrur shall take immediate steps to take the accused- respondents in custody and for realisation of fine.
