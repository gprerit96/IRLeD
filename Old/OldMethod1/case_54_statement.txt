$$$ j. religion incorporates the particular belief(s that a group of people subscribe to. hinduism as a religion incorporates all forms of belief without mandating the selection or elimination of any single belief. it is a religion that has no single founder no single scripture and no single set of teachings. it has been described as sanatan dharma namely eternal faith as it is the collective wisdom and inspiration of $$$$ that hinduism seeks to preach and propagate. it is keeping in mind the above precepts that we will proceed further. before highlighting the issues that confronts the court in the present case the relevant constitutional provisions in part iii of the constitution may be taken note of. $$$ in clear and unequivocal terms lays down that all laws including pre -constitution laws which are inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by part iii are void. sub -article brings within the fold of laws all rules regulations notification custom and usage having the force of law. while the several provisions of part iii would hardly need to be re -emphasized specific notice must be had of in the context of the present case the provisions contained in $$$ and of the constitution. while $$$ makes the freedom of conscience and the right to profess practice and propagate the religion to which a person may subscribe a fundamental right the exercise of such right has been made subject to public order morality and health and also to the other provisions of part iii. $$$ makes it clear that main part of the provisions contained in $$$ will not come in the way of the operation of any existing law or prevent the state from making any law which provides for social welfare and reform or for throwing open of hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of hindus. similarly $$$ while conferring the right on every religious denomination to manage its own affairs makes it clear that the right to manage the affairs of any religious denomination is restricted to matters of religion only. the provisions of part iii as noted above therefore makes it amply clear that while the right to freedom of religion and to manage the religious affairs of any denomination is undoubtedly a fundamental right the same is subject to public order morality and health and further that the inclusion of such rights in part iii of the constitution will not prevent the state from acting in an appropriate manner in the larger public interest as mandated by the main part of both $$$ and. besides the freedom of religion being subject to the other provisions of part iii undoubtedly $$$ and of the constitution has to be harmoniously construed with the other provisions contained in part iii. the necessary facts may now be noticed. in order to amend and consolidate the law relating to administration and governance of hindu religious and charitable institutions in the state of $$$ the state legislature has enacted the $$$ hindu religious and charitable endowments act hereinafter referred to as the $$$ act. a passing reference may be made at this stage to section of the $$$ act which provided that in case where the office holders or servants of a religious institution are required to be filled up on the principle of hereditary succession the person next in line of succession is entitled to succeed. there were some exceptions to the above rule i. where the person next in line is a minor or suffers from some incapacity. the aforesaid provision section was amended alongwith other related provisions by the amendment act of which came into force on january. by the aforesaid amendment the principle of next in line of succession was abolished. the amendment came to be challenged before this court which challenge was considered by a constitution bench of the court. in its judgment in seshammal and ors. $$$. $$$. v. state of $$$ $$$ / sc/063/$$$$$$$ / sc/063/$$$$ scc the constitution bench while upholding the validity of the amendment dealt with a further question namely though the principle of next in line was validly abolished whether the appointment of office bearers or servants of the temples are required to be made from a particular denomination / group / sect as mandated by the $$$ i. treatises pertaining to matters like construction of temples installation of idols and conduct of worship of the deity. the constitution bench after an elaborate consideration of the matter details of which will be noticed subsequently seems to have answered the aforesaid question in the affirmative. no controversy surfaced after the constitution bench judgment in seshammal supra until a g.o. no. dated.was issued by the government of $$$ department of tamil development cultural and endowments to the effect that any person who is a hindu and possessing the requisite qualification and training can be appointed as a $$$ in hindu temples. an $$$ no. dated.followed the aforesaid g.o. seeking to further amend sub -section of section of the $$$ act. the said provision of the act i. section by virtue of the amendment referred to above and the $$$ read as follows.no person shall be entitled to appointment to any vacancy referred to in sub -section merely on the ground that he is next in the line of succession to the last holder of office.change brought about by amendment of section on the ground of any custom or usage.change brought about by $$$. the explanatory statement to the $$$ in para indicated the purpose behind further amendment of section in the following terms.$$$ of the temples are to be appointed without any discrimination of caste and creed. custom or usage can not be a hindrance to this. it is considered that the position is clarified in the act itself and accordingly it has been decided to amend section of the said act suitably. the $$$ was replaced by the $$$ act no. of which received the assent of the governor on.. the act however did not contain the amendment to section as was made by the $$$. in other words the said amendment brought by the $$$ was dropped from the amending act of. the present writ petitions under $$$ of the constitution have been instituted by an association of $$$ and individual $$$ of sri meenakshi amman temple of madurai. the writ petitions were filed challenging the g.o. no. dated.and $$$ no. at that point of time the amending act of had not come into effect. as the amendment of section made by the $$$ had not been continued by the amending act of the said part of the challenge as against the ordinance made in the writ petitions became redundant leaving the legality and validity of the g.o..as the sole issue for consideration in the present writ petitions. preliminary objections have been raised to the maintainability of the writ petitions by shri p.p. rao and $$$ learned senior counsels appearing for respondents. it has been urged that the present writ petitions have not been filed as public interest litigations and in the absence of any specific orders in implementation of the impugned g.o. dated.the writ petitions are premature. it is further contended that even if the writ petitions are to be considered as pils the same raise questions with regard to appointment in public office i. $$$ in public temples and therefore the writ petitions will also not be maintainable as public interest litigations. it is further urged that as and when the g.o. is given effect to by actual appointment of an $$$ or $$$s as may be it will be open for the petitirs to raise the issue and establish that there is a usage or custom or customary practice governing the temple in question which require the appointment of the $$$ to be made from a particular denomination. it is difficult for us to accept the contentions advanced on be of the respondents with regard to the maintainability of writ petitions on counts. firstly it is difficult to appreciate as to why the petitirs should be non -suited at the threshold merely because the g.o. dated.has not been given effect to by actual orders of the state government. the institution of a writ proceeding need not await actual prejudice and adverse effect and consequence. an apprehension of such harm if the same is well founded can furnish a cause of action for moving the court. the argument that the present writ petition is founded on a cause relating to appointment in a public office and hence not entertainable as a public interest litigation would be too simplistic a solution to adopt to answer the issues that have been highlighted which concerns the religious faith and practice of a large number of citizens of the country and raises claims of $$$$ old traditions and usage having the force of law. the above is the ground namely the gravity of the issues that arise that impel us to make an attempt to answer the issues raised and arising in the writ petitions for determination on the merits thereof. $$$. parasaran learned senior counsel appearing for the petitirs has submitted that the issues arising in the case stand squarely covered by the pronouncement of the constitution bench in seshammal supra. in fact according to the learned senior counsel the issues in the present case are res judicata the same having been decided inter -partes in seshammal supra the $$$s of the $$$ temples and the respondent -state both being parties to the said decision. specifically$$$ has urged that in seshammal supra the constitution bench has unambiguously held that the appointment of an $$$ has to be as per the $$$ governing the particular temple and any deviation from the said age old custom and usage would be an infringement of the freedom of religion and the rights of the religious denomination to manage its own affairs as guaranteed by $$$ and of the constitution. the impugned g.o.by its prescription as noted therefore seeks to override the declaration of law made by the constitution bench in seshammal supra. $$$ has further urged that curtailment of the freedoms guaranteed by $$$ and of the constitution can only be made by the legislature and even a legislative exercise in this regard is circumscribed by the limitations contained in both $$$ and. in the present case the amendment of section of the $$$ act as made by $$$ no. of has not been continued by the amendment act no. of as already noted. the impugned g.o. has therefore to necessarily lose its efficacy. reliance herein is placed on the following passage from the report in sanjeev coke manufacturing v. bharat coking coal limited and $$$. $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 scc......the depnts of the affidavits filed into court may speak for the parties on whose be they swear to the statements. they do not speak for the parliament. no may speak for the parliament and parliament is never before the court. after parliament has said what it intends to say only the court may say what the parliament meant to say. n else. once a statute leaves parliament house the court is the only authentic voice which may echo interpret the parliament..... it was further contended that the g.o. wrongly relies on the decision in the case of n. adhithyan v. travancore devasom board and ors. $$$ / sc/06/$$$$$$$ / sc/06/$$$$ scc to justify its promulgation. the reliance placed on adhithyan supra in the face of the law laid down in seshammal supra is wholly misplaced. $$$ has further argued that the impugned go has to be read on its own terms and the validity thereof can not be saved by what appears to be a concession made by the state in para of the counter affidavit to the effect that the state would respect the distinction between saiva and vaishanava temples and the $$$ in each of such temples shall be appointed from either the saivas or vaishanavas as may be taking into account the indoctrination of the concerned $$$ in the $$$. according to $$$ neither all saivas nor all vaishnavas are ipso facto denominational. only a saiva who satisfies the eligibility under the sivagama and a vaishnava satisfying the eligibility under the pancharatna or vaikhanasa can be referred to as denominations. a person who is a member of such denomination al can be appointed as a $$$ of a saiva or a vaishnava temple as the case may be. on the other hand shri p.p. rao and $$$ learned $$$s appearing for the respondents have contended that the decision of the constitution bench in seshammal supra upholding the constitution validity of the amendment act of had opened the avenue to all qualified hindus irrespective of caste denominations etc to be appointed as $$$. it is contended that once the hereditary principle was held to be flexible the exclusive right of a particular group to appointment necessarily stood negated and it is qualification coupled with merit and eligibility that has to be the crucial test for appointment consistent with $$$ and of the constitution. learned counsels have specifically referred to the government order no. of and in this regard the recommendation of the high powered committee appointed for making recommendations for effective implementation of the impugned go dated.. it is contended by referring to the report of the high powered committee that the same demonstrates the lack of familiarity of even temple priests with the $$$ and their lack of knowledge of such $$$ and the practices of the temples as may be prescribed by the $$$. it is submitted that not only the contents of the $$$ have become uncertain even assuming otherwise the same can not be an authority to confer legitimacy to a practice which is inconsistent with and contrary to the provisions of the constitution specially those contained in part thereof. it is further submitted that the impugned go is consistent with and in fact effectuates the fundamental right of equality and equal opportunity and no contrary practice overriding the said provisions of the constitution would be legally acceptable. learned counsels have further submitted that there is no conflict between the judgments in seshammal supra and n. adithayan supra and it is possible to read the law declared in both the cases in a manner consistent with the constitutional requirements and principles. an additional issue has been struck by $$$ learned $$$ that the impugned go needs to be upheld on the touchst of the principle enshrined by $$$ of the constitution. the exclusive right of a particular group to enter the sanctum sanctorum of a temple and perform the rituals on the ground that performance of such rituals by any other person would defile the image is a thought and action which is prohibited by $$$ of the constitution. violation and consequently commission of offences under the protection of civil rights act has also been urged. the issues arising and the arguments made centre around the true meaning purport and effect of the constitution bench judgment in seshammal supra and in the above context the effect of the decision of the numerically smaller bench in n. adithayan supra. we will therefore proceed to understand the above position at the outset. the contours of the challenge in seshammal supra has already been noticed. to repeat it is the validity of the amendment act of which sought to amend inter alia section of the $$$ act that was questid in seshammal supra. the statement of objects and reasons for the amendment act of is stated as follows in the year the committee on untouchability economic and educational development of the scheduled castes has suggested in its report that the hereditary priesthood in the hindu society should be abolished that the system can be replaced by an ecclesiastical organisation of men possessing the requisite educational qualifications who may be trained in recognised institutions in priesthood and that the line should be open to all candidates irrespective of caste creed or race. in $$$ gurukkals and $$$ries are all ulthurai servants in hindu temples. the duties of ulthurai servants ' relate mainly to the performance of poojas rituals and other services to the deity the recitation of mantras vedas prabandas thevarams and similar invocations and the performance of duties connected with such performance and recitations. sections and of the $$$ hindu religious and charitable endowments act $$$ act of provide for appointment of office -holders and servants in the religious institutions by the trustees by applying the rule of hereditary succession also. as a step towards social reform hindu temples have already been thrown open to all hindus irrespective of caste... the arguments in support of the challenge were threefold the freedom of hereditary succession to the office of $$$ is abolished although succession to it is an essential and integral part of the faith of the saivite and vaishnavite worshippers.it is left to the government in power to prescribe or not to prescribe such qualifications as they may choose to adopt for applicants to this religious office while the act itself gives no indication whatever of the principles on which the qualifications should be based. the statement of objects and reasons which is adopted in the counter -affidavit on be of the state makes it clear that not only the scope but the object of the amendment act is to override the exclusive right of the denomination to manage their own affairs in the matter of religion by appointing $$$ belonging to a specific denomination for the purpose of worship.the amendment act gives the right of appointment for the time to the trustee who is under the control of the government under the provisions of the principal act and this is the very negation of freedom of religion and the principle of non -interference by the state as regards the practice of religion and the right of a denomination to manage its own affairs in the matter of religion. in the course of a very lengthy discourse and after considering the works of learned scholars in the field the law laid down by this court in respect of $$$ and till date and particularly the efficacy of the $$$ the constitution bench came to the following conclusion.any state action which permits the defilement or pollution of the image by the touch of an $$$ not authorised by the $$$ would violently interfere with the religious faith and practices of the hindu worshipper in a vital respect and would therefore be prima facie invalid under $$$ of the constitution. $$$ the constitution bench by referring to several earlier pronouncements of this court specifically mentid in para of the report identified the main principles underlying the provisions of $$$ and of the constitution in the following manner.the is that the protection of these articles is not limited to matters of doctrine or belief they extend also to acts d in pursuance of religion and therefore contain a guarantee for rituals and observances ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts of religion. the is that what constitutes an essential part of a religious or religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of a particular religion and include practices which are regarded by the community as a part of its religion. applying the aforesaid principles to the facts before it the constitution bench identified the main thrust of the arguments made in support of the challenge to the amendment to be with regard to the vesting of powers and authority in the temple trustee to appoint any person as an $$$ so long as he was holding a fitness certificate from of the institutions referred to in rule of the madras hindu religious institutions officers and servants service rules. the said rule required that an $$$ should be proficient in mantras vedas prabandams etc.namely that such a person is fit and qualified for performing puja and having knowledge of the rituals and other services. the constitution bench was told that the above position admits a situation where the requirement of rule can very well be dispensed with by a subsequent amendment of the rules thereby resulting in conferment of virtually unguided and unbridled powers to the trustee to appoint any person as a $$$ notwithstanding the fact that worship of the deity by a person other than belonging to a particular denomination may have the effect of defiling the deity. as the temple trustee is to function under the control of the state under section of the tamil nadu act the question highlighted before the constitution bench was whether by virtue of the amendment the state had gained a right to step into and control the sanctum sanctorum of a temple through the agency of the trustee and the $$$ thereby transgressing the rights granted to a religious denomination by $$$ and of the constitution. the constitution bench noticed that to counter the above situation the advocate general of the state of tamil nadu had contended that the power given to the trustee by virtue of the amendment to section was not a unqualified power but was subject to the provisions of section of the act which is in the following terms.section.to the provisions of the tamil nadu temple entry authorisation act the trustee of every religious institution is bound to administer its affairs and to apply its funds and properties in accordance with the terms of the trust the usage of the institution and all lawful directions which a competent authority may issue in respect thereof and as carefully as a man of ordinary prudence would deal with such affairs funds and properties if they were his own.in this regard the advocate general had virtually admitted that if the usage or practice of the institution required the $$$ of a temple to be of a particular denomination the said usage would be binding on the trustee and he would be bound to make appointment under section in accordance with such usage. the usage practice or custom requiring an $$$ to be of a particular denomination according to the advocate general was founded on religious beliefs and practices whereas the next in line principle if is to be regarded as a usage was a merely secular usage on which a legislation would be competent under $$$ of the constitution. it was alternatively contended that if the hereditary principle is to be understood as a religious practice alteration thereof can also be made by a legislation under $$$ such legislation being for the purpose of social welfare and reform. the constitution bench in seshammal supra answered the question by holding that the hereditary principle which was of long usage was a secular principle and therefore a legislation to alter the said usage i. the amendment act of was competent under $$$. however the constitution bench was quick to add that it is to the limited extent of the above exception al namely the liberty to make the appointment from persons beyond next in line to the last holder that the trustee is released from the obligation imposed on him by section of the tamil nadu act which otherwise requires the trustee to administer the affairs of the temple in accordance with the usage governing the temple. para of the constitution bench judgment wherein the aforesaid view finds mention may be noticed verbatim. in view of sub -section of section as it now stands amended the choice of the trustee in the matter of appointment of an $$$ is no longer limited by the operation of the rule of next -in -line of succession in temples where the usage was to appoint the $$$ on the hereditary principle. the trustee is not bound to make the appointment on the sole ground that the candidate is the next -in -line of succession to the last holder of office. to that extent and to that extent al the trustee is released from the obligation imposed on him by section of the principal act to administer the affairs in accordance with that part of the usage of a temple which enjoined hereditary appointments. the legislation in this respect as we have shown does not interfere with any religious practice or matter of religion and therefore is not invalid. a reading of the judgment of the constitution bench in seshammal supra shows that the bench considered the expanse of the agamas both in saivite and vaishnavite temples to hold that the said treatises restricted the appointment of $$$ to a particular religious denomination(s and further that worship of the deity by persons who do not belong to the particular denomination(s may have the effect of even defiling the idol requiring purification ceremonies to be performed. the constitution bench further held that while the appointment of $$$ on the principle of next in line is a secular act the particular denomination from which $$$ are required to be appointed as per the agamas embody a long standing belief that has come to be firmly embedded in the practices immediately surrounding the worship of the image and therefore such beliefs / practice constitute an essential part of the religious practice which under section of the act extracted above the trustee is bound to follow. the above which the petitirs contend to be the true ratio of the law laid down by the constitution bench in seshammal supra has been questid by the respondents who argue that seshammal supra is but the expression of an agreement of the constitution bench to what was a concession made before it by the advocate general of the state. according to the respondent in seshammal supra the constitution bench had no occasion to deal with the issue arising herein the challenge before it being confined to the validity of the amendment act of. the answers to the above will be dealt with a little later and for the present what has to engage the attention of the court is the true ratio of the law laid down by the numerically smaller bench in adithayan supra. the facts confronting the court in adithayan supra may now be noticed. the challenge therein was by a namboodri brahmin to the appointment of a non -namboodri brahmin who was otherwise well qualified to be appointed as a priest in the temple in question. the challenge was sought to be based on the ground that it has been a long standing practice and usage in the temple that its priests are appointed exclusively from $$$ and any departure therefrom is in violation of the rights of $$$ under $$$ and of the constitution. upon a consideration of the various earlier decisions of this court specifically referred to in adithayan supra details of which need not again be noticed herein such details are being separately noticed later though in a different context including the decision in seshammal supra it was held that rights claimed solely on the basis of caste can not enjoy the protection of $$$ and and no earlier decision of this court including seshammal supra would support the contention that even duly qualified persons can be barred from performing $$$s on the sole ground that such a person is not a brahmin by birth or pedigree. after expounding the law in the above manner it was held in adithayan supra that even proof of any such practice since the pre -constitutional days which in any case was not forthcoming can not sustain such a claim as the same would be in derogation of constitutional values and opposed to public policy or social decency. we do not see how the above view of this court in any way strikes a discordant note with the views expressed in any earlier decision including seshammal supra. the issues in seshammal supra were entirely different and the discussions therein para proceeds on the basis that entry to the sanctum sanctorum for a particular denomination is without any reference to caste or social status. the reference to the opinion of sri r. $$$ who has been referred to in the above para of the report as an undisputed scholar on the subject was cited to show that apart from the followers of the traditions so far as vaishnava temples are concerned...n others however high placed in society as pontiffs or $$$ or even other $$$ could touch the idols do $$$ or enter $$$....exclusion solely on the basis of caste was not an issue in seshammal supra so as to understand the decision in adithayan supra to be in any way a departure from what has been held in seshammal supra. before we go on to deliberate on the validity of the impugned g.o. dated.it will be useful to try to understand what is hinduism a broad answer is to be found in the preface to this report but perhaps we should delve a little deeper into the issue. the subject has received an in depth consideration of the country 's philosopher president dr. s. radhakrishnan in the celebrated work the hindu way of life. the said work has been exhaustively considered in sastri yagnapurushadji and ors. v. $$$ vaishya and $$$. $$$ / sc/00/966$$$ / sc/00/966 scr in the context of the question as to whether swaminarayan sect is a religion distinguishable and separate from the hindu religion and consequently the temples belonging to the said sect fell outside the scope of section of the bombay hindu places of public worship entry authorisation act. the aforesaid section of the act inter alia provided that every temple to which the act applied shall be open to the excluded classes for worship in the same manner and to the same extent as other hindus in general. while the eventual decision of the court which answered the question raised is in the negative namely that the sect in question was not a distinguishable and different religion it is the very learned discourse that is to be found in the report with regard to the true tenets of hinduism that would be of interest so far the present case is concerned. the following passages from the report are truly worthy of reproduction both for the purpose of recapitulation and illumination............................when we think of the hindu religion we find it difficult if not impossible to define hindu religion or even adequately describe it. unlike other religions in the world the hindu religion does not claim any prophet it does not worship any god it does not subscribe to any dogma it does not believe in any philosophic concept it does not follow any set of religious rites or performances in fact it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or creed. it may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more............................the hindu thinkers reckd with the striking fact that the men and women dwelling in india belonged to different communities worshipped different gods and practiced different rites $$$. ibid p.............................it presents for our investigation a complex congeries of creeds and doctrines which in its gradual accumulation may be compared to the gathering together of the mighty volume of the ganges swollen by a continual influx of tributary rivers and rivulets spreading itself over an ever -increasing area of country and finally resolving itself into an intricate delta of tortuous steams and jungly marshes.... the hindu religion is a reflection of the composite character of the hindus who are not people but many. it is based on the idea of universal receptivity. it has ever aimed at accommodating itself to circumstances and has carried on the process of adaptation through more than years. it has borne with and then so to speak swallowed digested and assimilated something from all creeds.religious thought & life in india by $$$ p.the history of indian thought emphatically brings out the fact that the development of hindu religion has always been inspired by an endless quest of the mind for truth based on the consciousness that truth has many facets. truth is but wise men describe if differently. the indian mind has consistently through the ages been exercised over the problem of the nature of godhead the problem that faces the spirit at the end of life and the interrelation between the individual and the universal soul. if we can abstract from the variety of opinion says dr. radhakrishnan and observe the general spirit of indian thought we shall find that it has a disposition to interpret life and nature in the way of monistic idealism though this tendency is so plastic living and manifold that it takes many forms and expresses itself in even mutually hostile teachings. ibid p.though philosophic concepts and principles evolved by different hindu thinkers and philosophers varied in many ways and even appeared to conflict with each other in some particulars they all had reverence for the past and accepted the vedas as the sole foundation of the hindu philosophy. naturally enough it was realised by hindu religion from the very beginning of its career that truth was many -sided and different views contained different aspects of truth which no could fully express.do the hindus worship at their temples the same set or number of gods that is another question which can be asked in this connection and the answer to this question again has to be in the negative. indeed there are certain sections of the hindu community which do not believe in the worship of idols and as regards those sections of the hindu community which believe in the worship of idols their idols differ from community to community and it can not be said that definite idol or a definite number of idols are worshipped by all the hindu in general. in the hindu pantheon the goods that were worshipped in vedic times were mainly indra varuna vayu and agni. later brahma vishnu and mahesh came to be worshipped. in course of time rama and $$$ secured a place of pride in the hindu pantheon and gradually as different philosophic concepts held sway in different sects and in different sections of the hindu community a large number of gods were added with the result that $$$$ the hindu pantheon presents the spectacle of a very large number of gods who are worshipped by different sections of the hindus.the development of hindu religion and philosophy shows that from time to time saints and religious reformers attempted to remove from the hindu thought and practices elements of corruption and superstition and that led to the formation of different sects. buddha stated buddhism mahavir founded $$$ism basava became the founder of lingayat religion $$$ and $$$ initiated the varakari cult guru nanak inspired sikhism dayananda founded $$$ and chaitanya began bhakti cult and as a result of the teachings of ramakrishna and vivekananda hindu religion flowered into its most attractive progressive and dynamic form. if we study the teachings of these saints and religious reformers we would notice an amount of divergence in their respective views but underneath that divergence there is a kind of subtle indescribable unity which keeps them within the sweep of the broad and progressive hindu religion.tilak faced this complex and difficult problem of defining or at least describing adequately hindu religion and he evolved a working formula which may be regarded as fairly adequate and satisfactory. $$$ acceptance of the vedas with reverence recognition of the fact that the means or ways to salvation are diverse and realisation of the truth that the number of gods to be worshipped is large that indeed is the distinguishing feature of hindu religion. this definition brings out succinctly the broad distinctive features of hindu religion. it is somewhat remarkable that this broad sweep of hindu religion has been eloquently described by toynbee. says toynbee when we pass from the plane of social practice to the plane of intellectual outlook hinduism too comes out well by comparison with the religions an ideologies of the south -west asian group. in contrast to these hinduism has the same outlook as the pre -christian and pre -muslim religions and philosophies of the western of the old world. like them hinduism takes it for granted that there is more than valid approach to truth and to salvation and that these different approaches are not only compatible with each other but are complementary. the fact that reference to hindus in the constitution includes persons professing the sikh $$$ and buddhist religions and the statutory enactments like hindu marriage act hindu succession act etc. also embraces sikhs jains and buddhists within the ambit of the said enactments is another significant fact that was highlighted and needs to be specially taken note of. what is sought to be emphasized is that all the above would show the wide expanse of beliefs thoughts and forms of worship that hinduism encompasses without any divergence or friction within itself or amongst its adherents. it is in the backdrop of the above response to the question posed earlier what is hinduism that we have to proceed further in the matter. image worship is a predominant feature of hindu religion. the origins of image worship is interesting and a learned discourse on the subject is available in a $$$$ old judgment of the madras high court in gopala mooppanar and ors. v. $$$ and ors. air madras. in the said report the learned judge $$$ j.on the basis of accepted texts and a study thereof had found that in the stage of existence of mankind god was worshiped as immanent in the heart of everything and worship consisted solely in service to s fellow creatures. in $$$$ the spirit of universal brotherhood has lost its initial efficacy and notions of inferiority and superiority amongst men surfaced leading to a situation where the inferior man was asked to worship the superior man who was considered as a manifestation of god. disputes arose about the relative superiority and inferiority which was resolved by the wise sages by introducing image worship to enable all men to worship god without squabbles about their relative superiorities. with passage of time there emerged rules regulating worship in temples which came to be laid down in the treatises known as agamas and the thantras. specifically in gopala moopanar supra it was noticed that the agamas prescribed rules as regards what caused pollution to a temple and as regards the ceremonies for removing pollution when caused.in the said judgment it is further mentid that there are it is well known thanthries in malabar who are specialists in these matters of pollution. as the temple priests have got the special saivite initiation or dheeksha which entitles them to touch the inner most image and as the touch of the persons who have got no such initiation even though they be $$$ was supposed to pollute the image even $$$ other than the temple priest were in many temples not allowed to go into the garbhagraham. the agamas also contain other prescriptions including who is entitled to worship from which portion of the temple. in of the agamas it is said as freely translated thus saivite brahmin priests are entitled to worship in the anthrala portion. $$$ learned in the vedas are entitled to worship in the arthamantapa other $$$ in the front mantapa $$$ and $$$ in the dwaramantapa initiated $$$ in the bahir mantapa and so on.the legal effect of the above prescriptions need not detain us and it is the portion underlined which is of particular importance as the discussions that follow would reveal. the ecclesiastical jurisprudence in india sans any specific ecclesiastical jurisdiction revolves around the exposition of the constitutional guarantees under $$$ and as made from time to time. the development of this branch of jurisprudence primarily arises out of claimed rights of religious groups and denominations to complete autonomy and the prerogative of exclusive determination of essential religious practices and principles on the bedrock of the constitutional guarantees under $$$ and of the constitution and the judicial understanding of the inter -play between $$$ and (b of the constitution in the context of such claims. in the commissir hindu religious endowments madras v. sri lakshmindra thirtha swamiar of sri shirur mutt $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scr shirur mutt while dealing with the issue of autonomy of a religious denomination to determine what rights and ceremonies are essential according to the tenets of its religion it has been stated that -under $$$ therefore a religious denomination or organization enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding as to what rites and ceremonies are essential according to the tenets of the religion they hold and no outside authority has any jurisdiction to interfere with their decision in such matters. besides the above recognition of the aforesaid principle is also to be found in the fact that in shirur mutt supra though the eventual conclusion of the court upholds the validity of the act madras hindu religious and charitable endowments act certain specific provisions i. section which empowered the commissir and his subordinates to enter the premises of any religious institution at any time for performance of duties enjoined under the act has been struck down indicating consistency with the principle extracted above. the relevant of the report page will require a specific notice and therefore is extracted below.we agree however with the high court in the view taken by it about section. this section empowers the commissir and his subordinate officers and also persons authorised by them to enter the premises of any religious institution or place of worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred or any duty imposed by or under the act. it is well known that there could be no such thing as an unregulated and unrestricted right of entry in a public temple or other religious institution for persons who are not connected with the spiritual functions thereof. it is a traditional custom universally observed not to allow access to any outsider to the particularly sacred parts of a temple as for example the place where the deity is located. there are also fixed of worship and rest for the idol when no disturbance by any member of the public is allowed. section it is to be noted does not confine the right of entry to the outer portion of the premises it does not even exclude the inner sanctuary the holy of holies as it is said the sanctity of which is zealously preserved. it does not say that the entry may be made after due notice to the head of the institution and at which would not interfere with the due observance of the rites and ceremonies in the institution. we think that as the section stands it interferes with the fundamental rights of the mathadhipati and the denomination of which he is head guaranteed under $$$ and of the constitution. our attention has been drawn in this connection to section of the act which it is said provides a sufficient safeguard against any abuse of power under section. we can not agree with this contention. clause a of section excepts from the saving clause all express provisions of the act within which the provision of section would have to be included. clause again does not say anything about custom or usage obtaining in an institution and it does not indicate by whom and in what manner the question of interference with the religious and spiritual functions of the math would be decided in case of any dispute arising regarding it. in our opinion section has been rightly held to be invalid. the decision of this court in sri $$$ and ors. v. state of mysore and ors. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 air sc may now be considered. in the said case this court was called upon to answer as to whether section of the madras temple entry authorization act violated the guarantee under $$$ insofar as $$$ are concerned by making provisions to the effect that $$$ at moolky was to be open to all excluded classes of hindus. it was the contention of the aforesaid sect that the temple in question was founded for the exclusive use and benefit of $$$. this court in its report elaborately discussed the practice of idol / image worship regulation thereof by the agamas and the efficacy and enforceability of such agamas. paras and of the report which deals with the above aspect may be usefully extracted below. the gods have distinct forms ascribed to them and their worship at home and in temples is ordained as certain means of attaining salvation. these injunctions have had such a powerful hold over the minds of the people that daily worship of the deity in temple came to be regarded as of the obligatory duties of a hindu. it was during this period that temples were constructed all over the country dedicated to vishnu rudra $$$ $$$ ganesha and so forth and worship in the temple can be said to have become the practical religion of all sections of the hindus ever since. with the growth in importance of temples and of worship therein more and more attention came to be devoted to the ceremonial law relating to the construction of temples installation of idols therein and conduct of worship of the deity and numerous are the treatises that came to be written for its exposition. these are known as agamas and there are as many as of them relating to the saiva temples the most important of them being the kamikagama the karanagama and the suprabedagama while the vikhanasa and the pancharatra are the chief agamas of the vaishnavas. these agamas contain elaborate rules as to how the temple is to be constructed where the principal deity is to be consecrated and where the other devatas are to be installed and where the several classes of worshippers are to stand and worship. the following passage from the judgment of $$$. in $$$ v. $$$ $$$ / tn/04/$$$$$$$ / tn/04/$$$$ mlj gives a summary of the prescription contained in of the agamas in the nirvachanapaddhathi it is said that $$$ should worship in the $$$ $$$ from the ante chamber or $$$ kshatriyas $$$ and $$$ from the $$$ the dancer and the musician from the nrithamantabham east of the $$$ and that castes yet lower in scale should content themselves with the sight of the gopuram.the other agamas also contain similar rules. according to the agamas an image becomes defiled if there is any departure or violation of any of the rules relating to worship and purificatory ceremonies known as samprokshana have to be performed for restoring the sanctity of the shrine. vide judgment of $$$. in $$$ v. subramania aiyar supra. in sankaralinga nadan v. raja rajeswara dorai it was held by the privy council affirming the judgment of the madras high court that a trustee who agreed to admit into the temple persons who were not entitled to worship therein according to the agamas and the custom of the temple was guilty of breach of trust. thus under the ceremonial law pertaining to temples who are entitled to enter into them for worship and where they are entitled to stand and worship and how the worship is to be conducted are all matters of religion. the conclusion is also implicit in $$$ which after declaring that all persons are entitled freely to profess practice and propagate religion enacts that this should not affect the operation of any law throwing open hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of hindus. we have dealt with this question at some length in view of the argument of the learned solicitor -general that exclusion of persons from temple has not been shown to be a matter of religion with reference to the tenets of hinduism. we must accordingly hold that if the rights of the appellants have to be determined solely with reference to $$$ then section of act v. of should be held to be bad as infringing it.eventually this court went on to hold that the provisions of $$$ are also subject to those contained in $$$ and accordingly dismissed the plea set up by the $$$ in the suit out of which the proceedings arose. the explicit reiteration of the court 's power to decide on what constitutes an essential religious practice in $$$ supra again found manifestation in durgah committee $$$ and $$$. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0063/96$$$ / sc/0063/96 air sc. $$$ j. as his lordship then was was of the view.... that in order that the practices in question should be treated as a part of religion they must be regarded by the said religion as its essential and integral part otherwise even purely secular practices which are not an essential or an integral part of religion are apt to be clothed with a religious form and may make a claim for being treated as religious practices within the meaning of $$$. similarly even practices though religious may have sprung from merely superstitious beliefs and may in that sense be extraneous and unessential accretions to religion itself. unless such practices are found to constitute an essential and integral part of a religion their claim for the protection under $$$ may have to be carefully scrutinised in other words the protection must be confined to such religious practices as are an essential and an integral part of it and no other. $$$$ we find a reiteration of the same view in the majority judgment rendered in commissir of police and ors. v. acharya $$$ and anr. $$$ / sc/08/$$$$$$$ / sc/08/$$$$ scc though the minority view in the said case preferred to take a contrary opinion relying inter alia on shirur mutt supra and $$$ v. state of connecticut $$$ us and united states v. ballard $$$ us. para of the minority opinion containing the discordant note would be worthy of reproduction. the exercise of the freedom to act and practise in pursuance of religious beliefs is as much important as the freedom of believing in a religion. in fact to persons believing in religious faith there are some forms of practising the religion by outward actions which are as much part of religion as the faith itself. the freedom to act and practise can be subject to regulations. in our constitution subject to public order health and morality and to other provisions in part iii of the constitution. however in every case the power of regulation must be so exercised with the consciousness that the subject of regulation is the fundamental right of religion and as not to unduly infringe the protection given by the constitution. further in the exercise of the power to regulate the authorities can not sit in judgment over the professed views of the adherents of the religion and to determine whether the practice is warranted by the religion or not. that is not their function. see $$$ v. state of connecticut $$$ at pp. -united states v. ballard $$$ at pp.. that the freedom of religion under $$$ and of the constitution is not only confined to beliefs but extends to religious practices also would hardly require reiteration. right of belief and practice is guaranteed by $$$ subject to public order morality and health and other provisions of part -of the constitution. sub -article is an exception and makes the right guaranteed by sub -article subject to any existing law or to such law as may be enacted to inter alia provide for social welfare and reforms or throwing or proposing to throw open hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of hindus. $$$ (b on the other hand guarantees to every religious denomination or section full freedom to manage its own affairs insofar as matters of religion are concerned subject once again to public order morality and health and as held by this court subject to such laws as may be made under $$$. the rights guaranteed by $$$ and therefore are circumscribed and are to be enjoyed within constitutionally permissible parameters. often occasions will arise when it may become necessary to determine whether a belief or a practice claimed and asserted is a fundamental part of the religious practice of a group or denomination making such a claim before embarking upon the required adjudication. a decision on such claims becomes the duty of the constitutional court. it is neither an easy nor an enviable task that the courts are called to perform. performance of such tasks is not enjoined in the court by virtue of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction conferred on it but in view of its role as the constitutional arbiter. any apprehension that the determination by the court of an essential religious practice itself negatives the freedoms guaranteed by $$$ and will have to be dispelled on the touchst of constitutional necessity. without such a determination there can be no effective adjudication whether the claimed right it is in conformity with public order morality and health and in accord with the undisputable and unquestionable notions of social welfare and reforms. a just balance can always be made by holding that the exercise of judicial power to determine essential religious practices though always available being an inherent power to protect the guarantees under $$$ and the exercise thereof must always be restricted and restrained. article which has virtually g unnoticed till date and therefore may now be seen is in the following terms:$$$$)-nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that an incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. a plain reading of the aforesaid provision i. article fortified by the debates that had taken place in the constituent assembly according to us protects the appointment of $$$ from a particular denomination if so required to be made by the agamas holding the field. the debates in the constituent assembly referred to discloses that the suggestion that the operation of article should be restricted to appointment in offices connected with administration of a religious institution was negatived. the exception in article therefore would cover an office in a temple which also requires performance of religious functions. in fact the above though not expressly stated could be of the basis for the views expressed by the constitution bench in sheshammal supra. the preceding discussion indicates the gravity of the issues arising and the perceptible magnitude of the impact thereof on hindu society. it would be therefore incorrect if not self defeating to take too pedantic an approach at resolution either by holding the principle of res judicata or locus to bar an adjudication on merits or to strike down the impugned g.o. as an executive fiat that does not have legislative approval made explicit by the fact that though what has been brought by the g.o. dated.was also sought to be incorporated in the statute by the $$$ eventually the amending $$$ presented before the legislature specifically omitted the aforesaid inclusion. the significance of the aforesaid fact however can not be underestimated. what is sought to be emphasized is that the same by itself can not be determinative of the invalidity of the g.o. which will have to be tested on certain other premises and foundation treating the same to be an instance of exercise of executive power in an area not covered by any specific law. the issue of untouchability raised on the anvil of article of the constitution stands at the extreme opposite end of the pendulum. article of the constitution strikes at caste based practices built on superstitions and beliefs that have no rationale or logic. the exposition of the agamas made a century back by the madras high court in gopala moopnar supra that exclusion from the sanctum sanctorum and duties of performance of poojas extends even to $$$ is significant. the prescription with regard to the exclusion of even brahmins in gopala moopnar supra has been echoed in the opinion of sri parthasarthy bhattacharya as noted by the constitution bench in seshammal supra. such exclusion is not on the basis of caste birth or pedigree. the provisions of article and the protection of civil rights act therefore would not be of much significance for the present case. similarly the offer of the state in its affidavit to appoint shaivite as $$$ in shiva temples and vaishnavas in vaishanvite temples is too naive an understanding of a denomination which is to say the least a far more sharply indentified subgroup both in case of shaivite and vaishanvite followers. however what can not be ignored is the admission inbuilt in the said offer resulting in some flexibility in the impugned g.o. that the state itself has acknowledged. sheshammal supra is not an authority for any proposition as to what an agama or a set of agamas governing a particular or group of temples lay down with regard to the question that confronts the court namely whether any particular denomination of worshippers or believers have an exclusive right to be appointed as $$$ to perform the poojas. much less has the judgment taken note of the particular class or caste to which the $$$ of a temple must belong as prescribed by the agamas. all that it does and says is that some of the agamas do incorporate a fundamental religious belief of the necessity of performance of the poojas by $$$ belonging to a particular and distinct sect / group / denomination failing which there will be defilement of deity requiring purification ceremonies. surely if the agamas in question do not proscribe any group of citizens from being appointed as $$$ on the basis of caste or class the sanctity of article or any other provision of part iii of the constitution or even the protection of civil rights act will not be violated. what has been said in sheshammal supra is that if any prescription with regard to appointment of $$$ is made by the agamas section of the tamil nadu act mandates the trustee to conduct the temple affairs in accordance with such custom or usage. the requirement of constitutional conformity is inbuilt and if a custom or usage is outside the protective umbrella afforded and envisaged by $$$ and the law would certainly take its own course. the constitutional legitimacy naturally must supersede all religious beliefs or practices. the difficulty lies not in understanding or restating the constitutional values. there is not an iota of doubt on what they are. but to determine whether a claim of state action in furtherance thereof overrides the constitutional guarantees under article and may often involve what has already been referred to as a delicate and unenviable task of identifying essential religious beliefs and practices sans which the religion itself does not survive. it is in the performance of this task that the absence of any exclusive ecclesiastical jurisdiction of this court if not other shortcomings and adequacies that can be felt. moreover there is some amount of uncertainty with regard to the prescription contained in the agamas. coupled with the above is the lack of easy availability of established works and the declining numbers of acknowledged and undisputed scholars on the subject. in such a situation is reminded of the observations if not the caution note struck by mukherjea j. in shirur mutt supra with regard to complete autonomy of a denomination to decide as to what constitutes an essential religious practice a view that has also been subsequently echoed by this court though as a minority view. but we must hasten to clarify that no such view of the court can be understood to an indication of any bar to judicial determination of the issue as and when it arises. any contrary opinion would go rise to large scale conflicts of claims and usages as to what is an essential religious practice with no acceptable or adequate forum for resolution. that apart the complete autonomy contemplated in shirur mutt supra and the meaning of outside authority must not be torn out of the context in which the views already extracted came to be recorded page. the exclusion of all outside authorities from deciding what is an essential religion practice must be viewed in the context of the limited role of the state in matters relating to religious freedom as envisaged by $$$ and itself and not of the courts as the arbiter of constitutional rights and principles. what then is the eventual result the answer defies a straight forward resolution and it is the considered view of the court that the validity or otherwise of the impugned g.o. would depend on the facts of each case of appointment. what is found and held to be prescribed by particular or a set of agamas for a solitary or a group of temples as may be would be determinative of the issue. in this regard it will be necessary to re -emphasise what has been already stated with regard to the purport and effect of article of the constitution namely that the exclusion of some and inclusion of a particular segment or denomination for appointment as $$$ would not violate article so long such inclusion / exclusion is not based on the criteria of caste birth or any other constitutionally unacceptable parameter. so long as the prescription(s under a particular agama or agamas is not contrary to any constitutional mandate as discussed above the impugned g.o. dated.by its blanket fiat to the effect that any person who is a hindu and possessing the requisite qualification and training can be appointed as a archaka in hindu temples has the potential of falling foul of the dictum laid down in seshammal supra. a determination of the contours of a claimed custom or usage would be imperative and it is in that light that the validity of the impugned g.o. dated.will have to be decided in each case of appointment of $$$ whenever and wherever the issue is raised. the necessity of seeking specific judicial verdicts in the future is inevitable and unavoidable the contours of the present case and the issues arising being what has been discussed. consequently and in the light of the aforesaid discussion we dispose of all the writ petitions in terms of our findings observations and directions above reiterating that as held in seshammal supra appointments of $$$ will have to be made in accordance with the agamas subject to their due identification as well as their conformity with the constitutional mandates and principles as discussed above.
