this appeal the $$$ seeks to assail the above order. $$$ for the $$$ contended that the $$$ served on the post for years on $$$$ wages and even as per the decision in para in umadevi 's case supra irregular appointment of employees who have worked for more than years should be considered on merits. it was contended that the $$$ has been working in a sanctid post and his appointment was not illegal but in the facts and circumstances of the case his appointment could only be irregular appointment entitling him for regularization. it was submitted that members committee as well as the high court did not keep in view that the case of the $$$ was recommended for regularization. per contra learned counsel for respondents no. to contended that principal of the college has no authority to make any appointment on any post on $$$$ wages as per the legislative scheme under section of bihar state universities act. it was submitted that members committee scrutinized the documents available on record and rejected claim of the $$$ for regularization and the high court rightly dismissed the claim of the $$$ for regularization. reiterating the submission learned counsel for respondent nos. to submitted that a principal of the college was not empowered under the universities laws to make appointment to class iii or class iv and that the $$$ was not appointed against any sanctid post and therefore he can not seek for regularization. we have carefully considered the rival contentions and also perused the impugned order and material on record. insofar as contention of the respondent that the appointment of the $$$ was made by the principal who is not a competent authority to make such appointment and is in violation of the bihar state universities act and hence the appointment is illegal appointment it is pertinent to note that the appointment of the $$$ as night guard was d out of necessity and concern for the college. as noticed earlier the principal of the college vide letters dated...and.recommended the case of the $$$ for regularization on the post of night guard and the university was thus well acquainted with the appointment of the $$$ by the then principal even though principal was not a competent authority to make such appointments and thus the appointment of the $$$ and other employees was brought to the notice of the university in. in spite of that the process for termination was initiated only in the year and the $$$ was reinstated w.f..and was removed from services finally in the year. as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the $$$ for a considerable time university never raised the issue that the appointment of the $$$ by the principal is ultra vires the rules of bsu act. having regard to the various communications between the principal and the university and also the education authorities and the facts of the case in our view the appointment of the $$$ can not be termed to be illegal but it can only be termed as irregular. human resources development department of bihar government vide its letter dated.intimated to the registrar of all the colleges that as per the settlement dated.held between bihar state university and college employees federation and the government it was agreed that the services of the employees working in the education institutions on the basis of prescribed staffing pattern are to be regularized. as per sanctid staffing pattern in ramashray baleshwar college there were vacant posts of class iv employees and the $$$ was appointed against the same. further resolution no. dated.issued by the human resources development department provides that employees working upto.shall be adjusted against the vacancies arising in future. although the $$$ was appointed in temporarily on the post that was not sanctid by the state government as per the above communication of human resources development department it is evident that the state government issued orders to regularise the services of the employees who worked upto.. in our considered view the high court ought to have examined the case of the $$$ in the light of the various communications issued by the state government and in the light of the circular the $$$ is eligible for consideration for regularization. as noticed earlier the case of the $$$ was referred to members committee and three members committee rejected the claim of the $$$ declaring that his appointment is not in consonance with the ratio of the decision laid down by this court in umadevi 's case supra. in umadevi 's case even though this court has held that the appointments made against temporary or ad -hoc are not to be regularized in para of the judgment it provided that irregular appointment of duly qualified persons in duly sanctid posts who have worked for years or more can be considered on merits and steps to be taken time measure to regularize them. in para the court observed as under:. aspect needs to be clarified. there may be cases where irregular appointments not illegal appointments as explained in s.v. $$$ r.n. $$$ and b.n. $$$ and referred to in para above of duly qualified persons in duly sanctid vacant posts might have been made and the employees have continued to work for years or more but without the intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals. the question of regularisation of the services of such employees may have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles settled by this court in the cases above referred to and in the light of this judgment. in that context the union of india the state governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a -time measure the services of such irregularly appointed who have worked for years or more in duly sanctid posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctid posts that require to be filled up in cases where temporary employees or $$$$ wagers are being now employed. the process must be set in motion within months from this date. we also clarify that regularisation if any already made but not sub judice need not be reopened based on this judgment but there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent those not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.the objective behind the exception carved out in this case was prohibiting regularization of such appointments appointed persons whose appointments is irregular but not illegal ensure security of employment of those persons who served the state government and their instrumentalities for more than years. elaborating upon the principles laid down in umadevi 's case supra and explaining the difference between irregular and illegal appointments in state of karnataka and ors. v. m.l. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0557/$$$$$$$ / sc/0557/$$$$ scc this court held as under:7. it is evident from the above that there is an exception to the general principles against regularisation enunciated in umadevi $$$ / sc/98/$$$$$$$ / sc/98/$$$$ scc if the following conditions are fulfilled:(i the employee concerned should have worked for years or more in duly sanctid post without the benefit or protection of the interim order of any court or tribunal. in other words the state government or its instrumentality should have employed the employee and continued him in service voluntarily and continuously for more than years.the appointment of such employee should not be illegal even if irregular. where the appointments are not made or continued against sanctid posts or where the persons appointed do not possess the prescribed minimum qualifications the appointments will be considered to be illegal. but where the person employed possessed the prescribed qualifications and was working against sanctid posts but had been selected without undergoing the process of open competitive selection such appointments are considered to be irregular. applying the ratio of umadevi 's case this court in nihal singh and ors. v. state of punjab and ors. $$$ / $$$$$$ / $$$ scc directed the absorption of the special police officers in the services of the state of punjab holding as under:35. therefore it is clear that the existence of the need for creation of the posts is a relevant factor with reference to which the executive government is required to take rational decision based on relevant consideration. in our opinion when the facts such as the s obtaining in the instant case demonstrate that there is need for the creation of posts the failure of the executive government to apply its mind and take a decision to create posts or stop extracting work from persons such as the $$$s herein for $$$$ together itself would be arbitrary action inaction on the part of the state. the other factor which the state is required to keep in mind while creating or abolishing posts is the financial implications involved in such a decision. the creation of posts necessarily means additional financial burden on the exchequer of the state. depending upon the priorities of the state the allocation of the finances is no doubt exclusively within the domain of the legislature. however in the instant case creation of new posts would not create any additional financial burden to the state as the various banks at whose disposal the services of each of the $$$s is made available have agreed to bear the burden. if absorbing the $$$s into the services of the state and providing benefits on a par with the police officers of similar rank employed by the state results in further financial commitment it is always open for the state to demand the banks to meet such additional burden. apparently no such demand has ever been made by the state. the result is the various banks which avail the services of these $$$s enjoy the supply of cheap labour over $$$$. it is also pertinent to notice that these banks are public sector banks. in our view the exception carved out in para of umadevi is applicable to the facts of the present case. there is no material placed on record by the respondents that the $$$ has been lacking any qualification or bear any blemish record during his employment for over decades. it is pertinent to note that services of similarly situated persons on daily wages for regularization viz. $$$ mishra who was appointed on daily wages on the post of $$$ was regularized w.f. the $$$ although initially working against unsanctioned post the $$$ was working continuously since.against sanctioned post. since there is no material placed on record regarding the details whether any other night guard was appointed against the sanctioned post in the facts and circumstances of the case we are inclined to award monetary benefits be paid from.. considering the facts and circumstances of the case that the $$$ has served the university for more than years on the post of night guard and that he has served the college on daily wages in the interest of justice the authorities are directed to regularize the services of the $$$ retrospectively w.f..the date on which he rejoined the post as per direction of registrar. the impugned order of the high court in lpa no. of dated.is set aside and this appeal is allowed. the authorities are directed to notionally regularize the services of the appellant retrospectively w.f..or the date on which the post became vacant whichever is later and without monetary benefit for the above period. however the appellant shall be entitled to monetary benefits from.. the period from.shall be taken for continuity of service and pensionary benefits. the appeal is allowed in terms of the above. no order as to costs.
