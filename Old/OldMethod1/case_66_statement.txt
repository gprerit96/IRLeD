v.n. khare j. leave granted. the short question that arises for our consideration in this group of appeals is where an insured has not preferred an appeal under section of the motor vehicles act hereinafter referred to as act against an award given by the motor accidents claims tribunal hereinafter referred to as tribunal is it open to the insurer to prefer an appeal against the award by the tribunal questioning the quantum of the compensation as well as finding as regards the negligence of the offending vehicle. before we proceed further it is necessary to set out brief facts of the

appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal in time.no appeal shall lie against any award of a claims tribunal if the amount in dispute in the appeal is less than rupees. since of the appeal arises out of the motor vehicles act hereinafter referred to as the act we may also briefly note the provisions of act. section of the act corresponds to section of act which provides that after the issuance of the certificate of insurance the insurance company shall satisfy the award or decree passed by the tribunal against the insured not exceeding the sum assured as if he were the judgment debtor. section of act which corresponds to section of act lays down that an insurance company can defend the action only on the ground of breach of conditions of the policy referred to in the said -section or on the ground that the policy is void for the reason referred to in the said sub -section. section of the act corresponds to section of the act and the same provides that the insurance company can not avoid the liability to any person entitled to benefit of any judgment or award referred to in sub -section except in the manner provided in sub -section of the act. $$$ of act and $$$ of act have been enacted on pattern of several english statutes which is evident from the report motor vehicles insurance committee -. in order to find out the real intention for enacting section of act which corresponds to section of act it is relevant to trace the historical development of the law for compulsory party insurance in england. prior to there was no law of compulsory insurance in respect of party rights in england. as and when an accident took place the injured claimant used to bring action against the motorist for recovery of damages. but in many cases it was found the owner of the offending vehicle had no means to pay to the injured or dependant of the deceased and in such a situation the claimants were unable to recover damages. it is under such circumstances various legislations were enacted. to meet the situation it is for the time the parties ' rights against insurance act was enacted in england. the provision of the said act finds place in section of act which gave to party a right to sue directly against the insurer. subsequently the road traffic act was enacted which provided for the compulsory insurance of motor vehicles. the provision of the said act is engrafted in section of act and section of act. it is relevant to notice that under section of the english act of certain conditions of insurance policy were made ineffective so far as parties were concerned. the object behind the said provision was that party should not suffer on account of failure of the insured to comply with those terms of the insurance policy. subsequently in the road traffic act was enacted. the object of the said legislation was to satisfy the liability of the insured. under the said enactment actions were provided. the was to satisfy the award passed against the insured. the was that in case the insurer did not discharge its liability the claimant had right to execute decree against the insurer. however in certain events namely what was provided in section which corresponds to section of act the insurer could defend his liability. the action provided for was contained in section of the road traffic act. under the said provision the insurer could defend his liability to satisfy decree on the ground that insurance policy was obtained due to misrepresentation or fraud. the said provision also finds place in section of act. while enacting the act and act all the actions have been engrafted in section of act and section of act. it may be remembered that neither the act nor the act conferred greater rights to the insurer than what had been conferred in english law. thus in common law an insurer was not permitted to contest a claim of a claimant on merits i. offending vehicle was not negligent or there was contributory negligence. the insurer could contest the claim only on statutory defences specified for in the statute. we have traced the legislative history of english law as regards liability of an insurer in the event of a motor accident in respect of party right was not for interpreting sections and of act but only for showing that while enacting $$$ of act or $$$ of act the intention of legislature was to protect party rights and not the insurer. to answer the question it is necessary to find out on what grounds the insurer is entitled to defend / contest against a claim by an injured or dependants of the victims of motor vehicle accident. under section of act which corresponds to section of act an insurance company has no right to be a party to an action by the injured person or dependants of deceased against the insured. however the said provision gives the insurer the right to be made a party to the case and to defend it. it is therefore obvious that the said right is a creature of the statute and its content depends on the provisions of the statute. after the insurer has been made a party to a case or claim the question arises what are the defences available to it under the statute. the language employed in enacting sub -section of section appears to be plain and simple and there is no ambiguity in it. it shows that when an insurer is impleaded and has been given notice of the case he is entitled to defend the action on grounds enumerated in the sub -section namely sub -section of section of act and no other ground is available to him. the insurer is not allowed to contest the claim of the injured or heirs of the deceased on other ground which is available to an insured or breach of any other conditions of the policy which do not find place in sub -section of section of act. if an insurer is permitted to contest the claim on other grounds it would mean adding more grounds of contest to the insurer than what the statute has specifically provided for. sub -section of section of act clearly indicates in what manner sub -section of section has to be interpreted. sub -section of section provides that no insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub -section or sub -section has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment or award as is referred to in sub -section or in such judgment as is referred to in sub -section otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub -section or in the corresponding law of the reciprocating country as the case may be. the expression ' manner employed in sub -section of section is very relevant which means an insurer can avoid its liability only in accordance with what has been provided for in sub -section of section. it therefore shows that the insurer can avoid its liability only on the statutory defences expressly provided in sub -section of section of act. we are therefore of the view that an insurer can not avoid its liability on any other grounds except those mentid in sub -section of section of act. it is relevant to note that the parliament while enacting sub -section of section only specified some of the defences which are based on conditions of the policy and therefore any other breach of conditions of the policy by the insured which does not find place in sub -section of section can not be taken as a defence by the insurer. if the parliament had intended to include the breach of other conditions of the policy as a defence it could have easily provided any breach of conditions of insurance policy in sub -section of section. if we permit the insurer to take any other defence other than those specified in sub -section of section it would mean we are adding more defences to insurer in the statute which is neither found in the act nor was intended to be included. for the aforesaid reasons we are of the view that the statutory defences which are available to the insurer to contest a claim are confined to what are provided in sub -section of section of act and not more and for that reason if an insurer is to file an appeal the challenge in the appeal would confine to only those grounds. before proceeding further it may be noticed that while the motor vehicles act was in force section 110-c(a was inserted therein in the year which corresponds to section of the act. the said provision provides that in course of an inquiry of a claim if the tribunal is satisfied that there is a collusion between the claimant and the insured or the insured fails to contest the claim the tribunal for reasons to be recorded in writing direct that the insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have without prejudice to the provisions contained in sub -section of section the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made. the aforesaid provisions show aspects. firstly that the insurer has only statutory defences available as provided in sub -section of section of act and where the tribunal is of the view that there is a collusion between the claimant and the insured or the insured does not contest the claim the insurer can be made a party and on such impleadment the insurer shall have all defenses available to it. then comes the provisions of section which provides for an appeal against the award given by the tribunal. under section any person aggrieved by an award is entitled to prefer an appeal to the high court. very often the question has arisen as to whether an insurer is entitled to file an appeal on the grounds available to the insured when either there is a collusion between the claimants and the insured or when the insured has not filed an appeal before the high court questioning the quantum of compensation. the consistent view of this court had been that the insurer has no right to file an appeal to challenge the quantum of compensation or finding of the tribunal as regards the negligence or contributory negligence of offending vehicle. in shankarayya and anr. v. united india insurance co. ltd. and anr. -$$$ / sc/0980/1998$$$ / sc/0980/1998 air1998sc968 it was held that an insurance company when impleaded as a party by the court can be permitted to contest the proceedings on merits only if the conditions precedent mentid in section are found to be satisfied and for that purpose the insurance company has to obtain an order in writing from the tribunal and which should be a reasd order by the tribunal. unless this procedure is followed the insurance company can not have a wider defence on merits than what is available to it by way of statutory defences. in absence of the existence of the conditions precedent mentid in section the insurance company was not entitled to file an appeal on merits questioning the quantum of compensation. in $$$ and anr. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/1439/1998$$$ / sc/1439/1998 question arose whether there can be a joint appeal by an insurer and owner of the offending vehicle. it was held that even in the case of a joint appeal by the insurer and the owner of an offending vehicle if an award has been made against the tortfeasors as well as the insurer even though an appeal filed by the insurer is not competent it may not be dismissed as such. the tortfeasor can proceed with the appeal after the cause title is suitably amended by deleting the name of the insurer. in the said case it also held thus:"the ground on which the insurer can defend the action commenced against the tortfeasors are limited and unless or more of those grounds is are available the insurance company is not and can not be treated as a party to the proceedings. that is the reason why the courts have consistently taken the view that the insurance company has no right to prefer an appeal under section of the act unless it has been impleaded and allowed to defend on or more of the grounds set out in sub -section of section or in the situation envisaged by sub -section of section of the act. in $$$ and ors. v. n.k. $$$ and anr.-manu / sc/050/000manu / sc/050/000 it was held that if n of the conditions as contained in sub -section of section exists for the insurer to avoid the liability the insurer is legally bound to satisfy the award and the insurer can not be a person aggrieved by the award. in such a case the insurer will be barred from filing an appeal against the award of the tribunal. it was also held that the insurer can not maintain a joint appeal along with the owner or driver if defence of any ground under section is not available to it. in $$$ smt and ors. v. new india assurance co. ltd and anr.-manu / sc/0/000manu / sc/0/000 it was held that the insurer having not obtained permission under section of act is not entitled to prefer any appeal to the high court against the award given by the tribunal on merits. however in united india insurance co. ltd. v. bhushan sachdeva and ors.-manu / $$$ / sc/0034/00 it was held that where the insured fails to file an appeal to the high court against the quantum of compensation awarded by the tribunal the insurer is entitled to file an appeal as the insured has failed to contest the claim and in that view of the matter the insurer could be a person aggrieved. this is the only decision which has taken a contrary view to the consistent view of this court in regard to maintainability of appeal at the instance of an insurer. in our view the decision in united india insurance supra does not lay down correct view of law for the reasons stated hereinafter. it was urged by learned counsel appearing for the insurance company that if an insured has not filed any appeal it means he has failed to contest the claim and that the right to contest include the right to contest by filing an appeal against the award of the tribunal as well and in such a situation an appeal by the insurer questioning the quantum of compensation would be maintainable. we have earlier noticed that motor vehicle accident claim is a tortious claim directed against tortfeasors who are the insured and the driver of the vehicle and the insurer comes to the scene as a result of statutory liability created under the motor vehicles act. the legislature has ensured by enacting section of the act that the victims of motor vehicle are fully compensated and protected. it is for that reason the insurer can not escape from its liability to pay compensation on any exclusionary clause in the insurance policy except those specified in section of the act or where the condition precedent specified in section is satisfied. for the aforesaid reasons an insurer if aggrieved against an award may file an appeal only on those grounds and no other. however by virtue of section of the act where in course of an enquiry the claims tribunal is satisfied that a there is a collusion between the person making a claim and the person against whom the claim has been made or the person against whom the claim has been made has failed to contest the claim the tribunal may for reasons to be recorded in writing implead the insurer and in that case it is permissible for the insurer to contest the claim also on the grounds which are available to the insured or to the person against whom the claim has been made. thus unless an order is passed by the tribunal permitting the insurer to avail the grounds available to an insured or any other person against whom a claim has been made on being satisfied of the conditions specified in section of the act it is not permissible to the insurer to contest the claim on the grounds which are available to the insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made. thus where conditions precedent embodied in section is satisfied and award is adverse to the interest of the insurer the insurer has a right to file an appeal challenging the quantum of compensation or negligence or contributory negligence of the offending vehicle even if the insured has not filed any appeal against the quantum of compensation. sections and are part of scheme and if we give any different interpretation to section of the act the same would go contrary to the scheme and object of the act. this matter may be examined from another angle. the right of appeal is not an inherent right or common law right but it is a statutory right. if the law provides that an appeal can be filed on limited grounds the grounds of challenge can not be enlarged on the premises that the insured or the persons against whom a claim has been made has not filed any appeal. section of act limits the insurer 's appeal on those enumerated grounds and the appeal being a product of the statute it is not open to an insurer to take any other plea other than those provided in section of act. the view taken in united india insurance co. ltd. v. bhushan sachdeva and ors. supra that a right to contest would also include the right to file an appeal is contrary to well established law that creation of a right to appeal is an act which requires legislative authority and no court or tribunal can confer such right it being of limitation or extension of jurisdiction. further the view taken in united india insurance supra that since the insurance companies are nationalised and are dealing with public money / fund and to deny them the right of appeal when there is a collusion between the claimants and the insured would mean draining out or abuse of public fund is contrary to the object and intention of the parliament behind enacting chapter xi of act. the main object of enacting chapter xi of act was to protect the interest of the victims of motor vehicle accidents and it is for that reason the insurance of all motor vehicles has been made statutorily compulsory. compulsory insurance of motor vehicle was not to promote the business interest of insurer engaged in the business of insurance. provisions embodied either in or act have been purposely enacted to protect the interest of travelling public or those using road from the risk attendant upon the user of motor vehicles on the roads. if law would have provided for compensation to dependants of victims of motor vehicle accident that would not have been sufficient unless there is a guarantee that compensation awarded to an injured or dependant of the victims of motor accident shall be recoverable from person held liable for the consequences of the accident. in skandia insurance co. ltd v. kokilaben chandravadan and ors. -it was observed thus:"in other words the legislature has insisted and make it incumbent on the user of a motor vehicle to be armed with an insurance policy covering party risks which is in conformity with the provisions enacted by the legislature. it is so provided in order to ensure that the injured victims of automobile accidents or the dependants of the victims of fatal accidents are really compensated in terms of money and not in terms of promise. such a benign provision enacted by the legislature having regard to the fact that in the modern age the use of motor vehicles notwithstanding the attendant hazards has become an inescapable fact of life has to be interpreted in a meaningful manner which serves rather than defeats the purpose of the legislation. the provision has therefore to be interpreted in the light of the aforesaid perspective. we have noticed the legislative development in regard to party rights in england and found that the object of those legislations was to protect the interest of party rights. the act as well as act both were enacted on pattern of english statute with the object to relieve the distress and miseries of victims of accidents and reduce the profitability of the insurer in regard to occupational hazard undertaken by them by way of business activities and not to promote business interests of insurance companies even though they may be nationalised companies. for the aforesaid reasons as well as that the learned judges in united india insurance co. ltd. supra have failed to notice the limited grounds available to an insurer under section of the act we are of the view that the decision in united india insurance supra does not lay down the correct view of law. it was then urged that if there is a collusion between the claimants and the insured or the insured does not contest the claim and the tribunal does not implead the insurance company to contest the claim on grounds available to the insured or the persons against whom claim has been made or in such a situation when the insurer files an application for permission to contest the claim on merit and the same is rejected or where claimant has obtained an award by playing fraud in such cases the insurer has a right of appeal to contest the award on merits and the appeal would be maintainable. we have already held that unless the conditions precedent specified in section of act is satisfied an insurance company has no right of appeal to challenge the award on merits. however in a situation where there is a collusion between the claimants and the insured or the insured does not contest the claim and further the tribunal does not implead the insurance company to contest the claim in such cases it is open to an insurer to seek permission of the tribunal to contest the claim on the ground available to the insured or to a person against whom a claim has been made. if permission is granted and the insurer is allowed to contest the claim on merits in that case it is open to the insurer to file an appeal against an award on merits if aggrieved. in any case where an application for permission is erroneously rejected the insurer can challenge only that part of the order while filing appeal on grounds specified in sub -sections of section of act. but such application for permission has to be bona fide and filed at the stage when the insured is required to lead his evidence. so far as obtaining compensation by fraud by the claimant is concerned it is no longer res integra that fraud vitiates the entire proceeding and in such cases it is open to an insurer to apply to the tribunal for rectification of award. for the aforesaid reasons our answer to the question is that even if no appeal is preferred under section of act by an insured against the award of a tribunal it is not permissible for an insurer to file an appeal questioning the quantum of compensation as well as findings as regards negligence or contributory negligence of the offending vehicle. for the aforesaid reasons the order and judgment under challenge in civil appeal no. @ s.l.p. civil no. is set aside arid appeal is allowed. civil appeal no. civil appeal no. @ s.l.p. civil no. and civil appeal no. @ s.l.p. civil no. 17076/ are dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs.
