s.b. sinha j. whether non -publication of a final electoral roll would render a general election invalid in law is the core question involved in this appeal filed by the appellant herein under section of the representation of the people -act. hereinafter referred to as the act which arises out of a judgment and order of the high $$$ of kerala dated.passed in e.p. no. of whereby and whereunder his election petition was dismissed.background fact. the election in question was held for kozhikode ii legislative assembly constituency on.. the  and respondents herein contested the said election. the appellant herein was the election agent of the respondent. the said election petition came to be filed in the following circumstances:. a preliminary electoral roll mother roll was published in which was revised on.and.purported to be in terms of continuous and special revision scheme. revision was carried out between.and.and another between.and.. the final electoral roll was published on.. despite the fact that $$$$ of acceptance of nomination was p.allegedly the final electoral roll was published at p. on.. the electoral roll consisted of voters out of which voters exercised their franchise. the result of the election was declared on.. the respondent was declared elected having secured votes whereas the respondent secured.votes. the and respondents herein obtained.and votes respectively. the winning margin was thus only votes. in the election petition the appellant herein alleged that after p. on.. names of voters were deleted from the voters list whereas new names were added therein. the fact which however stands admitted is that in the revision names of voters were deleted whereas names of voters were added. the appellant herein in the election petition further alleged that the electoral roll as it stood at p. on.which had been published prior thereto became final on the expiry of the time fixed for acceptance of nominations for election and thus the deletion of names of voters from the said roll without issuance of any notice was bad in law as thereby the genuine voters who turned up at the polling stations had been turned away. allegedly the majority of such persons were known supporters of the left democratic front whose candidate was the respondent. it was also furthermore contended that the names of persons were illegally added after the publication of the final electoral roll on the said date the majority of whom voted in support of the united democratic front to which the respondent herein belonged to. according to the appellant the said electoral roll in view of the prohibition contained in section of the representation of the people act for short the act was void ab initio as a result whereof the election of the respondent became vitiated by reason of improper refusal of votes of persons and improper reception of votes of.persons which being void could not have been taken into consideration for the purpose of the result of the election.issues. having regard the pleadings of the parties the learned tribunal framed $$$$ has the petitir adequate cause of action to challenge the declaration of results made on.whether the e.p is liable to be dismissed for non -joinder of necessary parties?( whether the e.p. is liable to be rejected / dismissed for want of adequate pleadings?( whether the names of voters were deleted from the final electoral roll after.without notice to them and in violation of law?( whether the refusal of voting right to the voters has materially affected the result of the whether the additional list of voters were added to the final electoral roll after.whether many of the said ineligible voters have voted for $$$$ respondent affecting the declaration of results?"( relief and costs?"findings of the high court:. the preliminary issues were decided in favour of the appellant by an order dated.. the said order is not in question in this appeal. the tribunal dismissed the election petition holding although irregularities had been committed in preparation and publication of the electoral roll as the appellant herein had not been able to prove that the legal requirement contained in section of the act was fulfilled the election of the respondent can not be set aside p.w.and p.w.who were examined on behalf of the appellant herein to show that their names were not included despite request were not relied upon on the ground that they had made the said request after.and as such their request had rightly been denied the appellant did not produce an authenticated copy of the electoral roll in full form to find out the alterations which according to the appellant were made subsequent to p. nor produced any such altered roll copies of the final electoral roll fer being ext. p and ext. p filed in the proceedings being not certified s the same were inadmissible in evidence the appellant admitted that he had no knowledge about the precise date on which the final electoral roll was published a copy of the final electoral roll having not been filed no finding can be arrived at for determination as to whether there had been any subsequent addition or deletion no clinching evidence had been adduced to show that there had actually been an addition of voters or more after p. or deletion of that number of votes thereafter ) no voter had come forward with a case that his right to vote was denied although the same is a constitutional right under article of the constitution of india although the election officer who examined himself as p.w. had not acted with responsibility the same did not have any direct effect in the outcome of the result though irregularities had been committed in the matter of preparation of electoral roll but the same were insufficient in upset the result of the election. it. was observed.. all these indicate that even after $$$$ let al for filing nominations p.w. might have entertained some applications for additions and effected deletions as well based on reports of anganwadi teachers received at . in fact the petitir has created a strong suspicion whether there was in actual fact any publication of the final roll as claimed by him in his notice board at all. the files produced by him do not contain the office copy of any notice published by him announcing publication of the final electoral roll whether it was published at p. on $$$$ or thereafter. the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant inter alia submitted that in the instant case there has been a flagrant violation of section of the act. the learned counsel would further contend that as the provision contained in $$$ -section of section of the act is mandatory in nature the violation thereof rendered the election void. he would urge that the election held pursuant to or in furtherance of the electoral roll prepared and published after.at. p. must be held to be wholly illegal rendering the election void ab initio. according to the learned counsel the high $$$ misdirected itself in passing the impugned judgment insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the electoral roll could not have been published at p. on.. the learned counsel took us through the evidences of p.w.p.w. p.w. p.w. and some other witnesses for the purpose of showing that the entire proceeding was wholly illegal and thus the election in its entirety should be set aside. the learned counsel would contend that the high $$$ should have exercised its suo motu power of directing recounting of votes so as to exclude the illegal s having regard to section of the act. reliance in support of the aforementid contentions has been placed by the learned counsel for the appellant on baidyanath panjira v. sita rain mahto and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ /

learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent on the other hand would submit that admittedly continuous and special revisions were carried out since the last during the period.and.. according to the learned counsel a revision of electoral roll was also carried on between.and.and in that situation it was incumbent upon the appellant herein to plead and prove that in between p. and p. on.names of how many persons were added or names of how many persons were deleted therefrom. the leaned counsel would contend that it has not and could not have been the case of the appellant herein that names of voters were added and names of voters were deleted after p. on.as admittedly the mother roll could be revised upto p. on.. mr. venugopal would urge that in law it is not necessary to make publication of the electoral roll in terms of $$$ -section of section of the act by p. of the date fixed for filing nomination inasmuch as the said provision contemplates mere issuance of directions by the specified authorities. while issuing such directions the statutory authorities are required to assign reasons as the said order would be appealable s. the learned counsel would contend that having regard to the provision of section of the act despite preparation of irregular electoral roll it is necessary to plead and prove that by reason thereof the result of the election had been materially affected. strong reliance in this regard has been placed on g.k. samal v. r.n. rao and ors. elr. the learned counsel in support of his aforementid contentions also relied on vashit

vis -a -vis wasted votes being the difference being times. however it was pointed out that the said decision was held to have been rendered in the peculiar fact situation of that case.questions: whether addition or deletion of names after $$$$ fixed for filing of nominations would invalidate the entire election? whether an election petitir must plead and prove as to how far and to what extent such illegal addition or deletion of the names of voters had materially affected the election?statutory provisions:. before embarking upon the questions referred to hereinbefore we may look to some statutory provisions. the act was enacted to provide allocation of scats in and the delimitation of constituencies for the purpose of election to the house of the people and the legislatures of states

has been published and will be available for inspection at my office..electoral registration officer place.. address..date....findings re. question no. roll. the purport and object of preparation of an electoral roll can not be under -estimated in view of the fact that thereby the persons included therein make the persons to decide as to whether they can contest election where for an enlistment of a voter is necessary. electoral roll is also helpful for the candidates to assess their chance of success. for reference to final electoral roll it is also required by the candidates to enable them to canvass amongst the voters. availability of a final electoral roll with the candidate is thus a matter of great importance for him. there can not further be any doubt whatsoever that the right to vote having regard to section of the act vis -a -vis article of the constitution of india is a valuable right. a person in terms of section of the act is entitled to exercise his right of franchise or is disabled therefrom if his name does or does not find place in the electoral roll.whether section of the act as well as requirement of publication of electoral roll is mandatory?. $$$ -section of section of the act in no uncertain terms provides for statutory injunction upon the authorities to make any revision in the electoral roll after $$$$ fixed which indisputably having regard to the law laid down by this $$$ in a number of decisions would mean p. of the date of filing the nominations. the rules referred to hereinbefore clearly lay down the procedure for filing the claims and objections and the mode and manner in which they are to be dealt with. in terms of the rules a claim or an objection can be entertained only at least days prior to the date of filing of nominations inasmuch as such claim in form no. is to be posted on the notice board inviting objections before days as is required in terms of rule. claims or objections could have therefore been entertained at least upto.. p.w. however states that no objection which was filed after the said date was entertained.$$$ -section of section of act is mandatory:. $$$ -section of section facie is imperative in character. it has been couched in a negative language. the word shall has also been used. what is thereby however prohibited is that after p. of the date specified for filing of the nomination no correction by way of amendment transposition or deletion of the entry can be made.publication of electoral roll however is not mandatory. the question which has been posed is whether the publication of the electoral roll was permissible after p. on.. the submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant to the effect that having regard to the provisions contained in section of the act and rule of the rules publication of an electoral roll is imperative in character can not be accepted. section of the act speaks of preparation and revision of electoral rolls. $$$ -section mandates that it shall come into force immediately upon its final publication in accordance with the rules made thereunder. when such finality would be attained however is a question of importance. the publication of an electoral roll having regard to $$$ -section of section can be revised in the prescribed manner by reference to the qualifying date. the said electoral roll is also required to be revised in $$$$ in the prescribed manner by reference to the qualifying date. the proviso appended to $$$ -section of section states that if the electoral roll is not revised the validity or continued operation of the said electoral roll shall not thereby be affected. $$$ -section of section empowers the election commission to direct a special revision. what is therefore contemplated under $$$ -section of section is a publication of final roll upon the revision thereof to be made in the prescribed manner. the manner in which such a revision would take place is enumerated in the rules. the rules however do not prescribe as to when such formal publication shall be made. form no. as referred to hereinbefore clearly states that upon consideration of the claims and objections filed by the affected persons the registration officer shall publish the amendment carried out in the mother roll. the mother roll in this case has been published in the year. final revision had also taken place in the years and. as noticed hereinbefore revision in had taken place in periods namely from.to.and from.to.. indisputably the revision carried out in the year as also during would be valid in law. having regard to the provision contained in $$$ -section of section of the act there can not be any doubt that any order passed immediately before p. on.would be valid. the very fact that $$$ -section of section prohibits any amendment transposition or deletion of any entry after the last for making nominations for an election in that constituency is a pointer to the fact that till p. of the date specified for filing nominations directions for any amendment can be issued. any order passed on the claims or objections filed in terms of section of the act read with relevant provisions of the rules would relate back from the date of publication of the electoral roll. any amendment transposition or deletion made in the electoral roll pursuant to or in furtherance of the directions made by the competent authority in the electoral roll upto p. of the specified date for filing nominations would therefore be valid. it would not therefore be correct to contend that any publication of final roll which is made after p. on.would render the entire electoral roll invalid in law. in terms of $$$ -section of section of the act what would be invalid is the addition or deletion of names which have been made by the statutory authorities after p. on $$$$. it may be true that a person whose name appeared in the electoral roll at the time of filing of the nomination can not be deleted thereafter and similarly no new names can be added. but the purport and object of $$$ -section as noticed hereinbefore is to enable a person to exercise his right of affording his candidature can not be taken away. if the name of such person was not included in the mother roll his remedy was only to file an application for inclusion of his name in terms of rule of the rules. it would thus bear repetition to state that the same has to be filed at least days prior to the date specified for filing nomination and not thereafter. an order on such application therefore was required to be passed in terms of section of the act read with relevant provisions of the rules immediately prior to p. of the specified date for filing nominations. once such directions are issued evidently publication of the list in terms of form no. would be only upon incorporation of directions for making amendment transposition or deletion of names. whenever publication of electoral roll is made in form necessary corrections have to be carried out in the mother roll. these are ministerial acts. however in the event any amendment transposition or deletion is made after p. the same would be invalid in law. by reason of any direction which is made after p. neither any person whose name has been added becomes entitled to vote nor a person whose name has been deleted becomes disentitled therefrom. the right of such a person to vote or not to vote must be determined in terms of the position of the electoral roll as it stood at p. on the date of filing of the nominations.principles as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory:6. a statute as is well -known must be read in the text and context thereof. whether a statute is directory or mandatory would not be dependent on the user of the words shall or may. such a question must be posed and answered having regard to the purpose and object it seeks to achieve. what is mandatory is the requirement of $$$ -section of section of the act and not the ministerial action of actual publication of form. the construction of statute will depend on the purport and object for which the same had been used. in the instant case the rules do not fix any time for publication of the electoral rolls. on the other hand section of the act categorically mandates that direction can be issued for revision in the electoral role by way of amendment in inclusion and deletion from the electoral roll till the date specified for filing nomination. the electoral roll as revised by reason of such directions can therefore be amended only thereafter. on the basis of direction issued by the competent authority in relation to an application filed for inclusion of a voter 's name a nomination can be filed. the person concerned therefore would not be inconvenienced or in any way be prejudiced only because the revised electoral role in norm is published . result of filing of such nomination would become known to the concerned parties also after.p.. furthermore even if the statute specifies a time for publication of the electoral roll the same by itself could not have been held to be mandatory. such a provision would be directory in nature. it is well -settled principle of law that where a statutory functionary is asked to perform a statutory duty within the time prescribed therefor the same would be directory and not mandatory. see shivshewar prasad sinha v. the district magistrate of monghyr and anr. $$$ / bh/000/$$$ / bh/000/ airpat $$$ v. the state of west bengal and ors. clj and garbari union co -operative

regard may be made on dr.  waman hiray v. mr. justice b. lentin and ors. $$$ / sc/02/88$$$ / sc/02/88 wherein it was observed:"law must be definite and certain. if any of the features of the law can usefully be regarded as normative it is such basic postulates as the requirement of consistency in judicial decision -making. it is this requirement of consistency that gives to the law much of its rigour. at the same time there is need for flexibility. professor h.l.a. $$$ regarded as of the leading thinkers of our time observes in his influential book the concept of law depicting the difficult task of a judge to strike a balance between certainty and flexibility where there is obscurity in the language of a statute it results in confusion and disorder. no doubt the $$$s so frame their judgments as to give the impression that their decisions are the necessary consequence of predetermined rules. in very simple cases it may be so but in the vast majority of cases that trouble the $$$s neither statute nor precedents in which the rules are legitimately contained allow of only result. in most important cases there is always a choice. the judge has to choose between alternative meanings to be given to the words of a statute or between rival interpretations of what a precedent amounts to. it is only the tradition that judges find and do not make law that conceals this and presents their decisions as if they were deductions smoothly made from clear pre -existing rules without intrusion of the judge 's choice.see also kanta devi smt.v. union of india and anr. $$$ / sc/0226/0$$$ / sc/0226/0. in shrimati tarulata shyam and ors. v. commissir of income -tax $$$ / sc/05/77$$$ / sc/05/77 it was held that if there be a casus omissus the defect ran be remedied only by legislation and not by judicial interpretation. rule of the rules can not therefore be interpreted to mean that publication of the electoral roll must lake place before the time of filing nomination and not thereafter.case laws operating in the field:5. in baidyanath panjira supra it is question for consideration is whether it was within the competence of the electoral registration officer to amend the electoral rolls after $$$$ for making the nomination was over. in baidyanath panjiar supra upon considering the scheme of the act and the principles underlying thereunder the court held that $$$ -section of section is mandatory having regard to the provision of section of the act. it was opined..in view of that provision the electoral roll referred to in section of the act must be understood to be the electoral roll that was in force on $$$$ for making the nominations for the election. it was next urged that even if we hold that in including fresh electors in the electoral roll on april the electoral registration officer contravened section of the act the same can not be made a ground for invalidating the election as the contravention in question does not come within the purview of sub -section of section of the act. this contention again does not appear to be sound. clause d)(iii of sub -section of section of the act provides that if the high $$$ is of the opinion that the result of the election in so far as it concerns the returned candidate has been materially affected by the improper reception refusal or rejection of any vote or the reception of any vote which is void it shall declare the election void. we have earlier come to the conclusion that the electoral registration officer had no power to include new names in the electoral roll on. april. therefore votes of the electors whose names were included in the roll on that date must be held to be void votes. that conclusion satisfies of the conditions prescribed in section. in $$$ supra a -judge bench of this $$$ following baidyanath panjiar supra reiterated that sub -section of section is mandatory. the question which arose therein revolved round the inclusion of the names in the electoral roll. therein the $$$ was considering an election of the local body of bidar district. the said votes were directed to be ignored from the total tally of the returned candidate. the court in the fact of that case exercised its jurisdiction in issuing a direction upon the high $$$ to send for the ballot papers pick out the ballots relating to the bidar board examine them without exposing the identify of the persons who had voted and to whom they had voted and record a re -tally excluding these tainted votes from the respective candidates. the said decision was considered in i. vikheshe sema supra. in that case also the invalid votes were directed to be rejected. however in that case the high $$$ did not pass any order on the application filed by the respondent therein. the respondent therein contended that the ballot papers should be summd and examined in order to find out the void votes and how the said votes affected the outcome of the election. in the aforementid situation this $$$ made the following observation whereupon the learned counsel or the appellant placed strong reliance:". once the high $$$ was convinced and it was evident from the facts on record that a large number of void votes had been received and they could have affected the outcome of the election then it was under a duty to have taken the next logical step which would have been to examine the votes which had been cast exclude the void votes and then re -count the valid votes in order to come to the conclusion whether the reception of the void votes had materially affected the result of the returned candidate. without undertaking this exercise the high $$$ was wrong in coming to the conclusion that the election of the appellant had been materially affected and that the same should be set aside. the said observations were made having regard to the fact that an application to that effect was filed. however in d.b. $$$ supra l.m. sharma as his lordship then was speaking for the bench held that any publication made after the specified time under section would be bad in law. the learned judge opined:". the vital difference between an act of a legislature and a sub -ordinate legislation was earlier noted in harla v. state of rajasthan $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$. the acts of the legislature are passed by the accredited representatives of the people who in theory can be trusted to see that their constituents know what has been d and this is d only after debates take place which are open to the public. the matter receives wide publicity through the media. but the case is different with the delegated legislation and it we may add also in the case of orders passed by the authorities like that in the present appeal before us. the mode of publication can vary but there must be reasonable publication of some sort. a reference may also be made to decision in $$$ v. state of bombay $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ which the question as to whether certain powers given to the government for issuing a direction to the collector not to act in accordance with the prescribed rules had been actually exercised or not was under consideration. it was stated that the power had to be exercised in clear and unambiguous terms and scr p. decision that the power has been exercised should be notified in the usual manner in which such decisions are made known to the public. with utmost respect we are unable to subscribe to the extreme views for the reasons stated hereinbefore. in $$$ supra this $$$ was considering a situation where without giving an opportunity to the voters to place the relevant materials and solely acting on a police report removed the name of the voters for undertaking a special intensive revision. the $$$ held that even for that purpose the procedure must be followed. the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has placed strong reliance on a constitution bench decision of this $$$ in radhey shyam $$$ supra. therein the constitution bench was considering an election held under $$$ municipalities regulation. the name of the respondent was incorrectly described his father 's name had been mentid as ratan lal instead of $$$. he filed an application for correction but no order was passed thereon. his nomination was however rejected on the ground that he was not of the voters. in that situation the election was set aside stating:"it is of the essence of these elections that proper electoral rolls should be maintained and in order that a proper electoral roll should be maintained it is necessary that after the preparation of the electoral roll opportunity should be given to the parties concerned to scrutinize whether the persons enrolled as electors possessed the requisite qualifications. opportunity should also be given for the revision of the electoral roll and for the adjudication of claims to be enrolled therein and entertaining objections to such enrolment. unless this is d the entire obligation cast upon the authorities holding the elections is not discharged and the elections held on such imperfect electoral rolls would acquire no validity and would be liable to be challenged at the instance of the parties concerned. it was in our opinion therefore necessary for the chief commissir to frame rules in this behalf and in so far as the rules which were thus framed omitted these provisions they were defective. the said judgment is clearly distinguishable and can not be held to have any application in the instant case. the learned counsel also relied upon a judgment of the division bench of the madhya pradesh high $$$ in $$$ supra wherein in a petition for issuance of a writ of quo warranto the election was set aside on the ground that the electoral roll was invalid.it is no doubt true that the petitir could have moved this $$$ earlier for appropriate relief even before the election was held but the relief now claimed is in the nature of a writ of quo warranto questioning the right of the respondents to to hold their offices. there is in such a case no question of delay or estoppel. on the other hand as we have already indicated no election on the basis of the rolls such as those in this case can be allowed to stand. we do not think that the said decisions lay down the correct principles of law. strong reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the appellant a.c. jose v. sivan pillai and ors. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 for the proposition that the election contrary to the scheme of the act and the rules would be void. in that case the commission in exercise of its power under article of the constitution of india issued a notification directing that the votes be cast by mechanical process in out of polling stations in a particular constituency in the state of kerala. the respondent therein was declared elected from that constituency defeating the appellant by a margin of votes only. the validity of the said notification was questid. this $$$ set aside the election of the respondent with respect of the polling stations where voting machines were used stating that by exercise of its power under article of the constitution of india no direction could be issued by the commission in contravention of the parliamentary legislation. it was held that article of the constitution relating to superintendence direction and control was actually vesting merely executive powers and not the legislative powers. in the aforementid situation the election was set aside as voting machines were used in certain constituencies contrary to law. a.c. jose supra is not an authority for the proposition that although some irregularity has been committed an election otherwise valid will have to be declared void even without arriving at a finding that the same has materially affected the result. the question as regard the applicability of section of the act was not examined therein nor in the fuels and circumstances obtaining therein it was necessary to he examined.re question no. of section of act:68. the appellant herein has filed an election petition for declaring the election of the respondent herein as void. for obtaining the aforementid relief it was necessary for him to show that amendment addition or deletion in the electoral roll alter.p. on.had indeed materially affected the result of the election. the law as it stands in our opinion would require a strict pleading and proof of the factors enumerated in section of the act for obtaining a declaration that the election was a void . such a declaration can only be made upon consideration of the materials brought on records. the election tribunal will have jurisdiction to issue such a direction only in the event or the other factors enumerated in the sub -clauses contained in sub -section of section of the act are fulfilled and not otherwise. the appellant herein has not placed any material to show as to names of how many persons were added or deleted after.p. as discussed hereinbefore even those electoral rolls have not been produced before the high $$$ for its comparison. whether the provision of section of the act is required to be mandatorily complied with or not fell for consideration in vashit narain sharma supra. in no uncertain terms it was held that the burden of proof would be on the election petitir. in vashit narain sharma supra this $$$ observed:"but we are not prepared to hold that the mere fact that the wasted votes are greater than the margin of votes between the returned candidate and the candidate securing the next highest number of votes must lead to the necessary inference that the result of the election has been materially affected. that is a matter which has to be proved and the onus of proving it lies upon the petitir. it will not do merely to say that all or a majority of the wasted votes might have g to the next highest candidate. the casting of votes at an election depends upon a variety of factors and it is not possible for any to predicate how many or which proportion of the votes will go to or the other of the candidates. while it must be recognized that the petitir in such a case is confronted with a difficult situation it is not possible to relieve him of the duty imposed upon him by section and hold without evidence that the duty has been discharged. should the petitir fail to adduce satisfactory evidence to enable the $$$ to find in his favour on this point the inevitable result would be that the tribunal would not interfere in his favour and would allow the election to stand. the said view was reiterated in mahadeo v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/029/965$$$ / sc/029/965. as noticed hereinbefore even baidyanath panjiar supra whereupon the learned counsel appearing on behalf of appellant placed strong reliance this $$$ while holding the provisions of section of the act to be mandatory held that the said illegality committed in the matter of amendment in the electoral roll has materially affected the result as envisaged under section of the act was required to be proved. the question raised herein is squarely covered by a -judge bench decision of this $$$ in g.k. samal supra wherein following vashit narain sharma supra it was held:"on the material on record we agree with the high $$$ that it has not been shown that the result of the election had been materially affected by the casting of votes by persons whose names were added to the electoral roll on april and the alleged non -voting of former electors whose names had been deleted. upon considering the pleadings in the election petition this $$$ opined:"the high $$$ was rightly impressed by the omission of any allegation that all or majority of the persons whose names were included in the electoral roll for the time in the evening of april were the supporters of respondent no. in the election. the learned counsel has not been able to show us any evidence which might indicate how many of the preference votes counted in favour of respondent no. were polled at jamshadpur $$$ or $$$ respectively.on the facts and the pattern of voting it is impossible to say that there was any substantial number of votes counted in favour of respondent no. which were void while those counted in favour of the petitir were of the original electors. in $$$ supra this $$$ in no uncertain terms held that if there existed a lacuna in the legislation it is for it to provide for a remedy stating:"in our opinion the decision of the learned judicial commissir that the election was to contravention of the act and the rules was correct in the circumstances of this case but that does not alter the position with regard to section of the act. that section requires that the election petitir must go a little further and prove that the result of the election had been materially affected. how he has to prove it has already been stated by this $$$ and applying that test we find that he has significantly failed in his attempt and therefore the election of the returned candidate could not be avoided. $$$ supra was decided in somewhat peculiar situation. an election petition was filed on the ground that a nomination of $$$ had been improperly accepted. the winning candidate obtained votes and the appellant herein got votes leaving a margin of votes. the said $$$ secured votes. the election petition was filed that $$$ was not entitled to seek election from the reserved constituency being kahar by caste and not a member of the scheduled caste. in the peculiar fact and circumstances of this case and in particular having regard to the fact that votes obtained by $$$ were almost times the difference between the number of votes secured by and successful candidates and the candidate securing the next highest number of votes it was held that an impossible burden of proof can not be thrown upon the appellant therein. this $$$ observed:"the number of votes secured by the candidate whose nomination was improperly accepted bore a fairly high proportion to the number of votes secured by the successful candidate- it was a little over -third. surely in that situation the result of the election may safely be said to have been affected. the bench while agreeing with the observation of $$$ j. in vashit narain sharma supra however opined:"it does not however mean that whatever the number of wasted votes and whatever the margin of difference between the number of votes secured by the successful candidate and the number of votes secured by the next highest candidate the court would invariably hold that the result of the election had not been materially affected. in an appropriate case having regard to the margin of difference between the votes secured by the successful candidate and the candidate securing the next highest number of votes and the proportion which such margin bears to the wasted votes it is permissible for the court to hold that the burden of proving that the result of the election has been materially affected has been discharged. $$$ supra therefore is not a decision which can be said to be an authority for the proposition that the number of votes which were liable to be rejected would itself be a barometer for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion that the burden of the election petitioner to prove the legal requirement of section of the act stands discharged. the said decision was rightly held to have been rendered in the peculiar fact situation of that case in shiv charan singh supra and $$$ supra on thus does not constitute a binding precedent. in $$$ supra this $$$ held:"the learned senior counsel for the appellant placed heavy reliance on $$$ v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/05/198 and submitted that the ratio of the decision squarely applies to the present case and should govern the decision thereof. it was submitted that in $$$ case $$$ / sc/05/198$$$ / sc/05/198 the candidate whose nomination was improperly accepted had obtained votes which was almost times the difference between the number of votes secured by the successful candidate and the candidate securing the next highest number of votes. so also the number of votes secured by the candidate whose nomination was improperly accepted bore a fairly high proportion to the number of votes secured by the successful candidate- a little over. the learned senior counsel submitted that on availability of these twin factors it was held by this $$$ that the result of the election might safely be said to have been affected while the case of the present appellant stands on a much better footing inasmuch as the number of votes secured by shri naresh yadav is almost times of the margin between the votes secured by the appellant and the respondent.at the blush the submission appears to be attractive but is found to be devoid of merit on closer scrutiny. $$$ case $$$ / sc/05/198$$$ / sc/05/198 came up for the consideration of this $$$ at least on occasions. in shiv charan case $$$ / $$$ / sc/09/1988 tek chand case $$$ / sc/008/01$$$ / sc/008/01 and j. rao $$$ / sc/0670/199$$$ / sc/0670/199 this court has held that $$$ case $$$ / sc/05/198$$$ / sc/05/198 rested on its own facts and did not overrule the earlier decisions of this court namely the decisions in vashist narain sharma case $$$ / sc/0101/195$$$ / sc/0101/195 and samant n. $$$ case $$$ / sc/0270/1969$$$ / sc/0270/1969. in $$$ case $$$ / sc/05/198$$$ / sc/05/198 not only the proportion of wasted votes was times of the margin there were candidates in all in the election fray. the court formed an opinion that a reasonable probability was raised in favour of holding that the result of the election had been materially affected. the decision in $$$ case $$$ / sc/0205/198$$$ / sc/0205/198 198]1scr966 does not set out detailed facts and circumstances and the nature of the evident adduced which may have persuaded the court in arriving at a finding in favour of the election petitioner. in view of the earlier decisions of this court existing before $$$ case $$$ / sc/0205/198$$$ / sc/0205/198 was decided it can not be held that merely because the number of wasted votes bears a high degree of proportion to the margin of votes between the winning candidate and the next highest candidate an inference must always be drawn that the result of the election was materially affected insofar as the returned candidate is concerned. there must be definite evidence available before the court enabling an inference being drawn as to how the wasted votes would have been distributed amongst the contesting candidates. the court can not conjectures or return findings on surmises. the view taken by this court in vashit narain sharma supra has consistently been followed also in j. chandra sekhara rao uma ballav rath smt.tek chand and a recent decision of this court in $$$ v. $$$ rawat and ors. $$$ / sc/061/200$$$ / sc/061/200 $$$. the appellant herein has not been able to show that names of how many persons were included after p. on.and how they have exercised their right of franchise. he has also failed to show by adducing any evidence that those persons whose names had been omitted would have voted for the respondent. the least the appellant could do was to file an appropriate application before the tribunal praying for inspection of ballot papers to find out the void votes which had been accepted so as to enable the high court to arrive at a conclusion how casting of such void votes affected the outcome of such election. further for inspection of ballot papers the election petition must make out a strong prima facie case only after setting out material facts in the election petition and leading evidence to that effect. the learned counsel however would submit that such an application was not necessary to be filed as it was the duty of the court to issue such directions. reliance in this connection had been placed on i. vikheshe sema supra. in that case such an application was filed but no order had been passed in that situation. the fact of the matter obtaining therein was absolutely different. furthermore as noticed hereinbefore therein such an application had been filed and this court merely held that without passing any order on such an application and without inspection of the ballot papers the high court could not have arrived at a finding that the result was materially affected. the fact of that case was converse to the present case. for the reasons aforementioned we do not find any merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly. no costs.
