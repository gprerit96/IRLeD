$$$ $$$. i regret my inability to concur with the conclusion reached by my learned brother pattanaik $$$ that because of the enactment of the tobacco board $$$ by parliament the state $$$ viz.the bihar agricultural produce markets $$$ in so far as it relates to levy of fee on the sale and purchase of tobacco is invalid. that the legislative power of parliament in certain areas is para mount under the constitution is not in dispute. what is in dispute is the limits of those areas as judicially defined. broadly speaking $$$ paramountcy is provided for under $$$ and of the constitution. the clauses of $$$ of the constitution relate to the demarcation of legislative powers between the parliament and the state legislatures. under $$$ notwithstanding anything contained in $$$s and parliament has been given the exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$ i or the union $$$ in the schedule. $$$ empowers the parliament and state legislatures subject to the power of parliament under $$$ -clause to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$ $$$i in the schedule described in the constitution as the concurrent $$$ notwithstanding anything contained in $$$ -clause. under $$$ the state legislatures have been given exclusive powers to make laws in respect of matters enumerated in $$$ $$$ in the schedule described as the state $$$ but subject to $$$s and. the lists while enumerating in detail the legislative subjects carefully distribute the areas of legislative authority between parliament $$$ i and the state $$$ $$$. the supremacy of parliament has been provided for by the non obstante clause in $$$ and the words ' subject to in $$$ and. therefore under $$$ if any of the entries in the lists overlap the entry in $$$ i will prevail. additionally some of the entries in the state $$$ have been made expressly subject to the power of parliament to legislate either under $$$ i or under $$$. entries in the $$$s of the schedule have been liberally interpreted nevertheless $$$s have been wary of upsetting this balance by a process of interpretation so as to deprive any entry of its content and reduce it to useless lumber. the use of the word exclusive in $$$ denotes that within the legislative fields contained in $$$ the state legislatures exercise authority as plenary and ample as parliament. the fact that under the scheme of our constitution greater power is conferred upon the center vis -a -vis the states does not mean that states are mere appendages of the center. within the sphere allotted to them states are supreme. the center can not tamper with their powers. more particularly the courts should not adopt an approach an interpretation which has the effect of or tends to have the effect of whittling down the powers reserved to the states. although parliament can not legislate on any of the entries in the state $$$ it may do so incidentally while essentially legislating within the entries under the union $$$. conversely the state legislatures may encroach on the union $$$ when such an encroachment is merely ancillary to an exercise of power intrinsically under the state $$$. the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment. this principle commonly known as the doctrine of path and substance does not amount to an extension of the legislative fields. therefore such incidental encroachment in either event does not deprive the state legislature in the case or parliament in the of their exclusive powers under the entry so encroached upon. in the event the incidental encroachment conflicts with legislation actually enacted by the dominant power the dominant legislation will prevail. to return to the subject of $$$ supremacy. the facet of the supremacy of parliament is to be found in $$$ which provides $$$ inconsistency between laws made by parliament and laws made by the legislatures of states -if any provision of a law made by the legislature of a state is repugnant to any provision of a law made by parliament which parliament is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to of the matters enumerated in the concurrent $$$ then subject to the provisions of $$$ the law made by parliament whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature of such state or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the legislature of the state shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void. in other words where in due exercise of legislative powers in the concurrent $$$ there is an irreconcilable conflict in the legislations enacted the central legislation will prevail. the doctrine of repugnancy has been developed in this context. see m / s hoechst pharmaceuticals ltd. v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ deep chand v. the state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ airsc. the controversy in this case is to be resolved keeping these broad principles in mind. the immediate question before us is whether the tobacco board $$$ debars the states from levying market fee in respect of tobacco. in the several matters argued and heard the main protagonists were the tobacco traders and dealers on the hand who argue that the states can not levy market fee on tobacco and the market committees on the other who contend to the contrary. the union of india and the tobacco board have supported the former while the state governments the latter. the details of the several matters which were heard by us have been noted in the opinion of pattanaik $$$. a galaxy of counsel have made submissions in support of the opposing camps. for the purpose of convenience and coherence the diverse arguments have been clubbed together and those contending against the states competence are referred to compendiously as the appellants and their oppnts as the respondents '. further clarification is necessary. as the order referring the issue to this $$$ was passed in an appeal relating to the bihar agricultural markets $$$ although several other states have enacted substantially similar statutes i will treat the bihar statute as representative and refer to the provisions of that $$$ for deciding the issues. the bihar agricultural produce markets $$$ referred to hereafter as the markets $$$ was enacted by the state of bihar and is ostensibly referable to entry of $$$ which gives the state legislature the exclusive power to legislate on markets and fairs read with entry of $$$ according to which the state legislature may also levy fees in respect of any matter in $$$ except $$$ fees. it is true that in belsund $$$ company v. state of bihar the $$$ proceeded on the basis that the markets $$$ had been enacted by the bihar legislature not only under the legislative power vested in it by entry but also under entries and of $$$ of the schedule of the constitution but in that case there does not appear to have been any controversy raised on this point. entries and of $$$ read as under:. trade and commerce within the state subject to the provisions of entry of $$$. production supply and distribution of goods subject to the provisions of entry of $$$. it has also been argued by the respondents that the state $$$ is also referable to entry of $$$ which describes the permissible subject matter of legislation by states as: agriculture including agricultural education and research protection against pest and prevention of plant diseases. except for entries and of $$$ each of the other entries comes within the exclusive legislative domain of the states. the tobacco board $$$ on the other hand is claimed by the appellants to be relatable solely to entry of $$$ i which enables parliament to legislate on industries the control of which by the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest. according to the appellants the markets $$$ seeks to regulate inter -alia the sale of various kinds of agricultural produce including tobacco. they contend that the provisions of the markets $$$ could not be applied to tobacco because the tobacco $$$ was enacted by parliament under entry of $$$ i to control and regulate everything relating to the tobacco industry from the growth of tobacco to its processing storing sale manufacture export and import. it had been initially argued by the appellants that once a declaration is made in terms of entry of the union $$$ the industry in respect of which the declaration is made and the entire process relating thereto becomes part of the legislative head itself and within the exclusive domain of the parliament and the state legislature becomes incompetent to enact any provision with regard to that industry. the submission was somewhat watered down in the reply. it was conceded that the argument was an extreme and that the true principle was that has to examine the actual extent of coverage by the central enactment. the next submission was that the word industry in entry of $$$ i will have to be given a wide meaning. $$$ from the $$$ were referred to to contend that an industry could be primary or . primary industries would include agriculture forestry fishing mining and the extraction of minerals etc. a ary industry would be a manufacturing industry where raw materials supplied by primary industries are processed to manufacture consumer and non -consumer goods. a industry would be where services were rendered such as banking insurance transportation information etc. this was contrasted with the meaning of the word as defined in the industries development and regulation $$$ which only deals with manufacturing industries. according to the appellants this $$$ in harakchand $$$ and ors. v. union of india $$$ / sc/00$$$$/9$$$ / sc/00$$$$/9 not only accepted the wide definition of industries but also specifically held that the word industry in entry would also comprise production supply and distribution of goods referred to in entry of $$$. it was therefore contended that the provisions of the tobacco $$$ were clearly within the exclusive competence of parliament and within the field covered in entry of $$$ i. as a corollary to this argument it was contended that parliament could also legislate with regard to the raw materials supplied to a declared industry in keeping with the principle of pith and substance. the next submission was that even if the state government retained the competence to legislate on tobacco it could not enact any statutory provisions which would be repugnant to the central $$$. the provisions of the tobacco $$$ and the markets $$$ were referred to in some detail to contend that they could not possibly co -exist and therefore the central $$$ would have to prevail. it was submitted that in the circumstances the provisions of the markets $$$ with respect to tobacco were repugnant to the provisions of the tobacco $$$ an that by virtue of the provisions of $$$ of the constitution the law made by parliament was to prevail and the law made by the legislatures of the state to the extent of the repugnancy with the central $$$ is void. the respondents on the other hand contended that the tobacco $$$ did not and could not occupy the entire legislative field relating to tobacco. according to them despite the declaration in section of the tobacco $$$ under entry of $$$ i the word industry in the context of the tobacco $$$ could not include anything more than processing and manufacturing of tobacco. reliance was placed primarily on the decision of the constitution $$$ in $$$ and ors. v. state of u.p. and ors. $$$ / sc/000$$$$/$$$ / sc/000$$$$/. it was further submitted on behalf of the respondents that the question of repugnancy between the markets $$$ and the tobacco $$$ would not arise since parliament was not competent to enact provisions in respect of a legislative field specifically provided for in $$$. it was submitted that the legislative field under entry of $$$ i was derived from entry of $$$ and entry did not cover the legislative fields otherwise specially provided for in $$$. it was stated that entry could not be rendered redundant by the central government 's legislation on commodities sold at markets and fairs by issuing a declaration under entry of $$$ i. it was also submitted that there may be provisions in the tobacco $$$ which may incidentally trench on the state 's competence and as long as states have not legislated on that topic the tobacco $$$ may prevail. it was submitted that even if the markets $$$ were enacted under entries and of $$$ nevertheless this would not make the market $$$ invalid as far as tobacco was concerned. it was further submitted that although entries and in the state $$$ were subject to the provisions of entry of the concurrent $$$ there was no provision in entry of the concurrent $$$ which covered tobacco. it was submitted that the issue of repugnancy did not arise because $$$ only relates to repugnancy in actual legislations in respect of entries in the concurrent $$$. according to the respondents assuming that parliament was competent to legislate in respect of tobacco there was in fact no repugnancy between the markets $$$ and the tobacco $$$ as the tobacco $$$ did not cover post auction sales. in any event there could be no conflict between the markets $$$ and the central $$$ in bihar particularly having regard to the fact that section and of the tobacco $$$ had not been made operative in bihar. reliance has been placed upon the absence of a non -obstante clause in the tobacco $$$ and the presence of section in that $$$ which according to the respondents makes it clear that the tobacco $$$ was to be read as being in addition to and not in derogation of any other law. therefore according to the respondents even if tobacco were solely within the exclusive field of legislation by parliament the state legislature could recover fees for services rendered in respect of markets where tobacco may be sold. to being with i do not think that this $$$ should at all go into the question of the validity of the tobacco board $$$ referred to briefly hereafter as the tobacco $$$ even thought he issue was argued at some length by the main protagonists before us. the dispute which originally gave rise to this set of appeals is limited to the question whether the market committees have the authority to levy market fee under the markets $$$ on the sale of tobacco and whether the provisions in the markets $$$ granting market committees such right are repugnant to the provisions of the tobacco $$$ and are therefore unconstitutional. what has been placed before this $$$ for its consideration is the correctness of the earlier decision in itc ltd and ors. v. state of karnataka $$$ / sc/000/$$$$$$$ / sc/000/$$$$. the question raised in that case was whether the provision of the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ relating to the levy of market fee on tobacco were repugnant to the tobacco $$$. the majority held that it was. the minority view was that both $$$s could co -exist. but the validity of the tobacco $$$ itself was never in dispute. no doubt the states have been given notice but the focus of the arguments has been on the levy of fees on the marketing of tobacco. as the tobacco $$$ covers a much larger field a pronouncement on the validity of all the provisions dealing with a variety of activities under the $$$ would not be appropriate as it would perhaps pre -empt a decision on aspects other than the marketing of tobacco without hearing those who might be interested in the outcome of a decision on those provisions. the starting point in any controversy dealing with apparently conflicting legislative jurisdictions is to see whether the conflict can be fairly reconciled by reading the entries to which the legislations are referable together and by interpreting and where necessary modifying the language of the by that of the other. it is only when such resolution is not possible that the $$$s should be called upon to decide the question of legislative competence. this principle has been stressed in a number of cases by the privy council the federal $$$ and more recently by this $$$. see the central provinces and berar sales of motor spirit & lubricants taxation $$$ governor -general in council v. province of madras ' state of bombay v. f.n. balsara air sc accountant & secretarial services pvt. ltd. v. union of india $$$ / sc/000/$$$ / sc/000/ airsc0$$$$ fatechand v. state of maharashtra $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ $$$ gas company proprietary ltd v. state of west bengal $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ airsc0. similarly when there is an apparent conflict between statutes enacted in valid exercise of legislative powers under the concurrent $$$ reconciliation must be attempted. only when the differences are irreconcilable should the $$$s resort to striking down a piece of legislation. see the kunnan devan hills produce v. the state of kerala $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ m / s. hoechst pharmaceuticals ltd. v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/09/$$$$$$$ / sc/09/$$$$. in my view if therefore the issue raised in this case can be resolved by limiting our consideration to the question of conflict if any between the entries in the schedule of the constitution to which the tobacco $$$ and the market $$$ are respectively relatable and between the provisions of the statutes which have a bearing on the marketing of tobacco it is unnecessary to stray into those areas which may not be necessary for the disposal of these appeals. the discussion in this opinion is therefore limited to the scope of the entries and the allegedly conflicting provisions of the $$$s with which we are concerned. the controversy in this case to a large extent turns on the meaning of the words industry as used in the legislative lists. now the power to legislate in respect of all industries has been given under entry of $$$ to the state legislatures subject to entries and of $$$ i. entries and of $$$ i allow parliament to legislate in respect of particular industries -namely such industries which are declared by parliament by law to be necessary for the defence or for the prosecution of war entry and industries the control of which by the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest entry. trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of the products of such controlled industry have been provided for in entry of the concurrent $$$ wherein both parliament and the state legislatures are competent to legislate. a constitution $$$ of this $$$ in the $$$ gas company prop.ltd. v. the state of west bengal has held that the expression industry in all the lists must be given the same meaning and that since ordinarily industry is in the field of state legislation the word must be construed in the context of the other entries in $$$ in such a manner so that no entry in $$$ is deprived of its content. in other words the meaning of the word industry is to be determined with reference to entry of $$$ where the power to legislate generally in respect of industries has been provided. entries and are entries which specify particular industries out of this general pool. the meaning of the word industry in these entries therefore must necessarily be derived from the meaning which may be ascribed to the word in entry of $$$. the seminal decision on this process of interpretation for arriving at the definition of industry is ch. $$$ and ors. v. state of uttar pradesh and ors. in which a constitution $$$ unanimously held.industry in the wide sense of the term would be capable of comprising different aspects raw materials which are an integral part of the industrial process the process of manufacture or production and and distribution of the products of the industry. the raw materials would be goods which would be comprised in entry of $$$. the process of manufacture or production would be comprised in entry of $$$ except where the industry was a controlled industry when it would fall within entry of $$$ i and the products of the industry would also be comprised in entry of $$$ except where they were the products of the controlled industries when they would fall within entry of $$$. the underlying rationale of $$$ 's definition of the word industry is that the constitution having expressly provided for particular fields of legislation in the $$$s each field must be given a meaning. entry of $$$ can not be read so as to subsume within itself the other entries in $$$. it must be given a meaning which allows the other entries to survive and be defined to that extent with reference to what it is not. thus in $$$ gas it was held that the word industry in entry of $$$ and and of $$$ i did not include gas and gas works which was in terms provided for in entry. the argument in that case was that the state was incompetent to enact the oriental gas company $$$. under entry of $$$ because parliament had passed the industries development & regulation $$$ by virtue of entry of $$$ i. the central $$$ in that case had under section declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the union should take under its control inter -alia industries of ' fuel gas coal gas natural gas and the like. for the purpose of promoting and regulating these industries the central $$$ enabled the central government to investigate into the affairs of an undertaking to regulate its production supply and distribution and if necessary to take over the management of the undertaking. the $$$ said that if the word industry in entry of $$$ and therefore of $$$ i were interpreted to include gas and gas works which were expressly covered by entry $$$ entry may become redundant and it would amount to attributing to the authors of the constitution ineptitude want of precision and tautology. as a result the challenge to the state $$$ was negatived and the central $$$ insofar as it purported to deal with the gas industry was held to be beyond the legislative competence of parliament. again in b. viswanathiah and company and ors. v. state of karnataka $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ writ petitions were filed challenging the validity of the provisions of the $$$ and cocoon regulation of production supply and distribution $$$ $$$ of. it was contended that the impugned provisions lacked legislative competence after the enactment by parliament of the central silk boards $$$ $$$ of which contained a declaration as contemplated under entry of $$$ i. the $$$ held following $$$ that the control of the industry vested in parliament was only restricted tot he aspect of production and manufacture of silk yarn or silk. it did not obviously take in the earlier stages of the industry namely the supply of raw materials.it was also held:"though the production and manufacture of raw silk can not be legislated upon by the state legislature in view of the provisions of the central $$$ and the declaration in section thereof that declaration and entry does not in any way limit the powers of the state legislature to legislate in respect of the goods produced by the silk industry. to interpret entry otherwise would render entry in $$$ of the schedule to the constitution otiose -and meaningless. this process of defining industry in entry of $$$ and consequently entry of $$$ i by eliminating from its scope the fields specifically provided for in $$$ or $$$i has been consistently followed. for example in state of a.p. v. mcdowell and co $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ it was said:"parliament can not take over the control of industries engaged in the production and manufacture of intoxicating liquors by making a declaration under entry of $$$ i since the said entry governs only entry in $$$ but not entry in $$$. in kanan devan hill produce v. state of kerala $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 it was held that a declaration under entry of the union $$$ in respect of the tea industry did not debar the states from legislating to acquire land under tea cultivation under entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$. a constitution $$$ in ganga $$$ corporation ltd. v. state of uttar pradesh and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ upheld the power of states to impose purchase tax on sugarcane under item in the state $$$ despite central legislation under entry of $$$ i in respect of the sugar industry. another constitution $$$ in fatech chand v. state of maharashtra $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 had to decide the constitutional tug -of -war between the maharashtra debt relief $$$ on the hand and the gold control $$$ on the other. it was contended that the debt $$$ was void insofar as it dealt with gold loans because parliament had occupied the field under entry of $$$ i. it was also urged that there was inconsistency between the debt $$$ and the gold control a. sic debt $$$ could not be given effect to the extent of such sic. the $$$ noted that the debt $$$ came squarely within entry of $$$ $$$ namely my -lending and my -lenders relief of agricultural indebtedness and it was held that despite the fact that the gold $$$ was referable to entry of $$$ i...this does not mean that other entries in the state $$$ become impotent even regarding gold. the state legislature can make laws regarding my -lending even where gold is involved under entry list $$$ even as it loan regulate gambling in gold under entry impose sales tax on gold sales under entry regulate by municipal laws under entry and by trade restrictions under entry the type of buildings for gold ships and the kind of receipts for purchase or sale of precious metal. to multiply instances is easy but the core of the matter is that where under its power parliament has made a law which overrides an entry in the state $$$ that area is abstracted from the state $$$. nothing more. it is unnecessary to multiply instances of the numerous decisions which have followed the logic of $$$ and accepted its conclusion that for the purposes of entry of $$$ $$$ and consequently entry of $$$ i industry means manufacture or production and nothing more. it is sufficient to note that $$$ 's definition of industry has been affirmed and applied recently by a constitution $$$ in belsund $$$ company v. state of bihar supra and is still good law. harak chand $$$ 's case does not strike a discordant note. harakchand $$$ and ors. v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ has been cited by the appellants in support of the proposition that the negative test laid down in $$$ and developed in $$$ gas does not apply to define the scope of entry of $$$ i vis -ã   entry of $$$ $$$. the submission is unacceptable. in $$$ 's case the constitutional validity of the gold control $$$ enacted by parliament was questid. gold had been declared to be a controlled industry under entry of $$$ i by the industries development & regulation $$$. of the challenges raised was that the activity sought to be controlled by the gold $$$ was not an industry and did not come within the preview of parliament under entry of $$$ i. the passage particularly relied upon by the appellants is question to be considered is what is the meaning of the word industry in entry of $$$ i entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$. whatever may be its connotation it must bear the same meaning in all these entries which are so interconnected that conflicting or different meanings given to them would snap the connection. in the shorter oxford $$$ the word industry is defined as a particular branch of productive labour a trade or manufacture.according to $$$ 's new international $$$ edn.the word industry means a systematic labour especially for the creation of value a department or branch of a craft art business or manufacture a division of productive and profit making labour especially that employs a large personnel and capital especially in manufacturing a group of productive or profit making enterprises or organisations that have a similar technological structure of production and that produce or supply technically substitutable goods services or sources of income.it was said that if the word industries is construed in this wide sense entry of $$$ $$$ will lose all meaning and content. it is not possible to accept this contention for entry is a general power should not be so interpreted as to nullify a particular power conferred by the same instrument. in $$$ v. state of uttar pradesh scr the expression industry as defined to mean the process of manufacture or production and did not include raw materials used in the industry or the distribution of the products of the industry. it was contended that the word industry was a word of wide import and should be construed as including not only the process of manufacture or production but also activities antecedent thereto such as acquisition of raw materials and subsequent thereto such as disposal of the finished products of that industry. but this contention was not accepted. it was contended by mr. daphtary that if the process of production was to constitute industry a process of machinery or mechanical contrivance was essential. but we see no reason why such a limitation should be imposed on the meaning of the word industry in the legislative lists. similarly it was argued by mr. paalkhivala that the manufacture of gold ornaments was not an industry because it required application of individual art and craftsmanship and aesthetic skill. but mere use of skill or art is not a decisive factor and will not take the manufacture of gold ornaments out of the ambit of the relevant legislative entries. it is well settled that the entries in the lists are only legislative heads or fields of legislation and they demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislature can operate. the legislative entries must be given a large and liberal interpretation the reason being that the allocation of subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but is a mere enumeration of broad and comprehensive categories. it is not however necessary for the purpose of this case to attempt to define the expression industry precisely or to state exhaustively all its different aspects. but we are satisfied in the present case that the manufacture of gold ornaments by goldsmiths in india is a process of systematic production for trade or manufacture and so falls within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entries. it follows therefore that in enacting the impugned $$$ parliament was validly exercising its legislative power in respect of matters covered by entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$.emphasis mine)0. the decision can not be read as whittling down or deviating from the reasoning or the definition of the word industry in $$$. it does not sack to do so. indeed the $$$ re -affirmed the definition of industry in $$$. the observation relating to entry of $$$ $$$ must be understood in relation to the language of the entry which reads:"production supply and distribution of goods subject to the provisions of entry of $$$. this provides for states to generally legislate on production supply and distribution of goods. entry of $$$ $$$i deals particularly with the production supply and distribution of the products of industries where the control of such industry by the union is declared by law to be expedient in the public interest under entries or of $$$ i. it would not have been necessary to have especially provided for trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of the products of a controlled industry in entry of $$$ $$$i had the word industry in entries and of $$$ i covered the fields. similarly had the word industry in entry of $$$ $$$ been sufficient why have a separate head under entry of the same list dealing with the production supply and distribution of goods unless we concede that the framers of the constitution were guilty of ineptitude want of precision and tautology the concept of a general and particular term is necessarily relative depending upon the context in which the term is considered. entry of $$$ $$$ is certainly a generally entry but only in relation to entry of $$$ $$$i which deals with trade commerce etc. in particular kinds of products namely the products of a controlled industry. finally it is clear from the passage quoted that $$$ held that the gold $$$ was legislatively competent under entry of $$$ i because it dealt with the process of manufacture or production of gold i.it was within the sweep of industry as defined in $$$. the appellants submission that $$$ narrowly construed the word because the decision was rendered in the context of the industrial development & regulation $$$ proceeds on a miss -appreciation of the decision. merely because $$$ found that the particular central enactment under consideration was under entry of $$$ $$$i and not entry of $$$ i does not limit or detract from its authoritative pronouncement on the scope of entry of $$$ i. the finding in fact formed the basis of the conclusion that the provisions of the central $$$ in question did not fall within entry of $$$ i. what was construed was the ambit of entry of $$$ i and the range of a declaration under that entry. that the declaration was contained in the industries development and regulation $$$ was inconsequential and could into colour the scope of the entry itself. it is significant that $$$ 's case which according to the appellants accepted a wider meaning of industry was also a case in which the relevant declaration under entry of $$$ i was under the industries. development and regulation $$$. $$$ 's case has been considered and explained in the subsequent decision of the constitution $$$ in m / s fatchand $$$ and ors. v. state of maharashtra $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9. with specific reference to $$$ 's case the $$$ held..we see nothing in that decision which contradicts the position that while the gold control $$$ fell within entry of $$$ i the state $$$ was not totally suspended for that reason for purposes of legislating on subjects which fell within that $$$ but incidentally referred also to gold transactions. to add to the persuasive force of their arguments the appellants then put forward what can only be described an argument of alarm. it was contended that if a narrow view of industry were taken then despite a declaration by parliament under entry of $$$ i that an industry was necessary for the purpose of defence of the country or for the prosecution of war parliament would not be competent to legislate on the supply of raw materials or distribution of the finished product. such an argument is hardly relevant to a question of construction. in any case it overlooks the superior powers of parliament under entry of $$$ $$$i and the overriding powers of parliament during a national emergency including those under $$$ and. to sum up the word industry for the purposes of entry of $$$ i has been firmly confined by $$$ to the process of manufacture or production only. $$$sequent decisions including those of other constitution $$$es have re -affirmed that $$$ 's case authoritatively defined the word industry -to mean the process of manufacture or production and that it does not include the raw materials used in the industry or the distribution of the products of the industry. given the constitutional framework and the weight of judicial authority it is not possible to accept an argument canvassing a wider meaning of the word industry. whatever the word may mean in any other context it must be understood in the constitutional context as meaning ' manufacture or production. applying the negative test as evolved in $$$ in this case it would follow that the word industry in entry of $$$ $$$ and consequently entry of $$$ i does not and can not be read to include entries and of $$$ $$$ which have been expressly marked out as fields within the state 's exclusive legislative powers. as noted earlier entry deals with markets and fairs and entry with the right to levy fees in respect of in the present context markets and fairs. entry of $$$ i does not override entry in $$$ $$$ no has entry in $$$ $$$ been made subject to entry unlike entry of $$$ $$$. this $$$ in belsund $$$ supra has also accepted the argument that entry of $$$ $$$ operated in its own and can not be affected by any legislation pertaining to industry as found in entry of $$$ i. if industry does not include markets and fairs it is important to define what markets and fairs connote. market may strictly be defined as the meeting or congregating together of people for the purchase and sale of provisions or livestock publicly exposed at a fixed time and place. a fair has been judicially defined as meaning a periodical concourse of buyers and sellers in a place generally for sale and purchase... at times or on occasion ordained by custom. the distinction between markets and fairs appears to lie in the periodicity viz. while a market may be a regular or permanent place of business a fair is an intermittent. at common law fairs and markets were also franchises or rights to hold a concourse of buyers and sellers to dispose of the commodities in respect of which the franchise is given. this included the right to levy a toll or sum payable by the buyer upon sales of articles in a market. the sense in which the words has been used in entry appears to cover not only such right but the market place itself including the concourse of buyers and sellers ' and the regulation of all these. the word markets has also found place in entry of $$$ which reads stock exchanges and future markets. a constitution $$$ of this $$$ in waverly $$$ute mills co. ltd. raymon & co. india private ltd. $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 rejected the submission that the word markets must be restricted to a place set apart for the meeting of the general public of buyers and sellers freely open to nay such to assemble together where any seller any expose his goods for sale and any buyer may purchase.it was held no doubt ordinarily means a place where business is being transacted. that was probably all that it meant at a time when trade was not developed and when transactions took place at specified places. but with the development of commerce bargains came to be concluded more often that not through correspondence and the connotation of the work market underwent a corresponding expansion. in modern parlance the work market has come to mean business as well as the place where business is carried on. the question then is does the markets $$$ fall within this definition of the word ' markets the establishment of regulated markets had long been recognized as an imperative requirement of any ordered plan of agricultural development in this country. the objects and reasons for enacting the bihar markets $$$ has been stated as properly organising markets of agricultural and allied commodities to ensure that the agriculturist gets a fair share of the price paid by the consumer for his produce by attempting to do away or rigidly controlling the middle man. what was originally a source of private profit in common law has by virtue of the markets $$$ become a matter of municipal concern namely setting up of regulated markets for the marketing of agricultural produce. the provisions of the markets $$$ are briefly noted. the markets $$$ provides for he issuance of a notification under section by the state government declaring its intention of regulating the purchase sale storage processing of specified produce in that area. agricultural produce has been defined in section as all produce whether processed or non -processed manufactured or not of agriculture horticulture plantation $$$ $$$ sericulture pisciculture and includes live stocks or poultry as specified in the schedule. tobacco has been mentid at item xi in the schedule. under section the state government declares the area specified as a market area for the purpose of the markets $$$. from the date of the declaration under section no person or authority can establish or continue or be allowed to set up any place for the purchase sale stores or processing of any notified agricultural produce except in accordance with the provisions of the markets $$$. under section the state government may declare by notification any building or locality in any market area to be the principal market yard. sections to and to deal with the setting up of market committees their constitution and functions. these market committees are subject to the superintendence and control of the bihar agricultural marketing board set up under section of the markets $$$. section prohibits notified agricultural produce from being bought or sold by any person at any place in the market area other than the relevant principal market yard or sub -market yard or yards established therein unless it is for retail sale personal consumption or exempted by the marketing board under section or. the mode of purchase and sale specified under section is by means of open auction or tender system. $$$ -section of section specifically authorise the market committee to issue licences to persons engaged in the processing storage or processing of agricultural produce to operate in the market area and also to control and regulate the admission of persons into the market yard or the sub -market yards and to prosecute persons trading without a valid licence. section empowers the market committee to levy and collect market fee from the buyer on the agricultural produce bought or sold in the market area at specified rates. the remaining sections of the markets $$$ omitted from consideration as they are not at all relevant. we are really concerned with section and more particularly sections. the setting up of markets areas markets yards and regulating use of the facilities within such area or yards by levy of market fee is a matter of local interest and would be covered by entry of $$$ $$$ and thus within the legislative competence of the state. if any portion of the market area or the market yards is used of the sale or purchase of tobacco that too will be within the state 's competence. to hold to the contrary would be to ignore the exclusive powers of the states to legislate in respect of markets and fairs under entries and of $$$ $$$. the markets $$$ does not seek to regulate either the manufacture or production of tobacco assuming that agricultural produce can be manufactured and thus does not impinge upon the tobacco $$$ in so far as it is at all relatable to entry of $$$ i. all the provisions of the markets $$$ in my views are clearly relatable to entry of $$$ ii given the scope of the entry as discussed earlier. the state in the circumstances was not incompetent to incidentally also legislate with regard to tobacco and the semantic sweep of entry did not come in the way of the state legislature making laws on subjects within its sphere and not directly going to the heart of the industry itself. in my opinion therefore sections and of the markets $$$ in pith and substance are relatable to entries and of $$$ $$$ and have been competently enacted by the state. incidentally it is nobody 's case that the fee charged under section does not represent a quid pro quo for the services rendered and facilities afforded in the market area. it follows that parliament is incompetent to legislate for the setting up or regulation of markets and fairs within the meaning of the phrase in entry of $$$ $$$ even in respect of tobacco. it may of course incidentally trespass into the state legislative field provided the trespass is an inseparable apart of the provisions validly passed and the state has not already fully occupied its field with conflicting statutory provisions. let us consider the scope of the tobacco $$$. the statement of objects and reasons of the tobacco $$$ shows that the enactment was necessary in view of the fact that india is the largest producer of tobacco in the world the largest among the tobacco exporting countries and the largest exporter of virginia tobacco. the manifest intention of parliament was to take measures to ensure that the tobacco particularly virginia tobacco met the demands of the markets in india and abroad both qualitatively and quantitatively. the $$$ which extends to the whole of india has however not been brought entirely into force in all the states. chapter i contains the fist sections. section $$$ -section provides for the $$$ coming into fore on such dates as the central government may by notification in the official gazette appoint provided that different dates may be appointed for different provisions for the $$$ and for different states or different parts thereof. section contains the necessary declaration in terms of entry $$$ i in relation to the tobacco industry. chapter $$$ of the $$$ consists of sections to and deals with the establishment and functions of the tobacco board. section casts a duty on the board to promote the development of the tobacco industry. $$$ -section prescribes some specific measures which may be taken by the board. those which are of relevance are noted:"$$$$(...keeping a constant watch on the virginia tobacco market both in india and abroad and ensuring that the growers get a fair and remunerative price for the same and that these are no wide fluctuations in the prices of the commodity;(c maintenance and improvement of existing markets and development of new markets outside india for indian virginia tobacco and its products and devising of marketing strategy in consonance with demand for the commodity outside india including group marketing under limited brand establishment by the board of auction platform with the previous approval of the central government for the sale of virginia tobacco by registered grower or curers and functioning of the board as an auctier at auction platform established by or registered with it subject to such conditions as may be specified by the central government...regulating in other respects virginia tobacco marketing in india and export of virginia tobacco having due regard to the interests of growers manufacturers and dealers and the nation;(g purchasing virginia tobacco from growers when the same is considered necessary or expedient for protecting the interests of the growers and disposal of the same in indian or abroad as and when considered appropriate... sections to are in chapter $$$i which deals with regulation of production and disposal of tobacco for registration / licensing not only of the growers including nursery growers section but also curers section processors and manufactures section graders and stores and exporters dealers packers or auctiers section. of particular relevance are sections and which provide for virginia tobacco to be sold at registered auction platforms or auction platforms established by the board and places a duty on registered dealers and exporters to purchase tobacco only at such auction platforms. however in those stated in which section is not in force under section dealers purchasing virginia tobacco must pay the full price for the whole quantity and are restricted from taking recourse to any such practice which may be specified as unfair by the board. section deals with the forms for registration and section with the power of inspection t ascertain whether the particulars in the forms are correct. apart from these sections according to the appellants section in particular occupies the field with respect to levy of fees on the sale of tobacco. it reads:"-a( where virginia tobacco is sold at nay auction platform established by the board under this $$$ it shall be competent for the board or for any officer of the board authorised by it in this behalf to levy fees for the services rendered by the board in relation to such sale at such rate not exceeding percent of the value of such tobacco as the central government may form time to time by notification in the official gazette specify;( the fees levied under $$$ -section shall be collected by the board or such officer equally from the seller of the virginia tobacco and the purchaser of such tobacco in such manner as may be prescribed. the contents of chapter iv and v of the $$$ need not detain us as they deal with aspects far removed from the markets $$$. of the last chapter viz. chapter vi sections are noteworthy viz. section which allows the central government to suspend provisions of the $$$ in respect of certain territories and section which reads:.the provisions of this $$$ shall be in addition to and not in derogation of and not in derogation of the provisions of nay other law for the time being in force. the object of the tobacco $$$ is to keep a control on the quality and quantity of tobacco grown in the country with an eye on the international markets. the location of domestic markets for sale of tobacco can hardly be described as a necessary concomitant to the achievement of this object. assuming it is fairly read it is possible to reconcile the allegedly conflicting provisions of the statutes by a reasonable and practical construction of their provisions. the use of the word markets and marketing in the tobacco $$$ including section does not mean a market in the sense the word has been used in the markets $$$. it is obvious from phrases such as the virginia tobacco market development of new markets outside india ' etc. that the word has been used in the sense of sale as controlled by supply and demand especially a demand for a commodity or service -in this case tobacco. the tobacco $$$ is not concerned so much with the where but with the how the tobacco is disposed of. even when the tobacco $$$ speaks of setting up of auction platforms it does not indeed it could not say where the auction platforms are to be set up. since state are exclusively competent to decide on the location of markets the authorities under the tobacco $$$ would have to comply with the municipal laws and set up the auction platforms only within the permissible areas. if the facilities afforded under the market $$$ are utilised the facilities will have to be paid for and the authorises appointed to levy and collect fees for the purpose under the markets $$$ would be competent to do so. if further facilities are offered at the auction platforms under the tobacco $$$ fees may be levies under section of that $$$. the right to levy fees under the acts therefore may not necessarily conflict the levy not being in the alternative but additional. assuming this is not possible and there is any conflict the provisions of the markets $$$ and not the tobacco $$$ would prevail. even if sections and of the markets $$$ are not referable to entries and of $$$ $$$ and are referable to entries and of $$$ $$$ -nevertheless these sections of the markets $$$ do not trespass on turf reserved by parliament under entry of $$$ i state legislation on the supply and distribution of goods as well as trade and commerce therein which are relatable to entries and is only subject to the central enactment if any under entry of the concurrent $$$ and not entry of $$$ i. furthermore whether or not any portion of the tobacco $$$ relater to an industry within the meaning of entry $$$ i following the logic of $$$ at least those provisions relating to the disposal of tobacco are not so relatable. the declaration under entry $$$ i does not cover these provisions and the states were free to legislate under entries of $$$ $$$ on tobacco. i do not propose to decide whether the provisions of the tobacco act dealing with the sale of tobacco may be sustained with reference to entry of $$$. it is an unnecessary exercise because the appellants did not argue this and also because as i have said earlier the constitutional validity of the provisions of the tobacco $$$ has not been referred to this $$$ for scrutiny. assuming that chapter of the tobacco $$$ are covered by entry of $$$ i nevertheless the parliament did not intend to invalidate nay portion of the markets $$$. it has consciously clarified by section that it does not intend to occupy the entire field and has made space for the state legislation and made it clear the provision of the central $$$ shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law. the section assumes greater significance since most of the markets $$$s were in pace when the tobacco $$$ was enacted. there are ways in which such a saving clause as is contained in section of the tobacco $$$ may be understood. there is the way which found favour with this $$$ in m.$$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 which held that such a section clearly evinced the intention of the dominant legislature leaving no room for any argument that the state $$$ was in any way repugnant to the central $$$. there is the other way of reading such a section in the dominant legislation as incorporating or taking under its legislative umbrella the allegedly conflicting provisions of the subservient statute. either way the express words in section couples with the duty of $$$s to reconcile and uphold legislation if possible can only result in upholding the constitutional validity of the market fee imposed by the state. a further compelling circumstance to uphold the levy of market fee is the fact that several provisions of chapter of the tobacco $$$ particularly those dealing with the setting up of auction platforms namely sections and and section relating to the levy of fees on the sale of tobacco have not been brought into operation in any state in indian except for the state of karnataka. i have already stated the reasons why the provisions relating to sale of tobacco in the tobacco $$$ do not come within the definition of industry and are not covered by the declaration under entry of $$$ i. but granting or the sake of argument that the sale of tobacco comes within the definition of industry until the central government chooses to actually occupy the field by effective legislation it would remain open for the state legislature to cover that field under entry of $$$ $$$. it is difficult to adopt an interpretation which would debar the states from the right to provide for the sale of tobacco only within market areas and levy market fees although parliament does not now and may never seek to bring sections and into operation in those states. this view finds support in the pronouncement of a constitution $$$ in $$$ p ltd. v. state of uttar pradesh supra when it was construing the impact of a declaration under entry of $$$ i it was said that legislation for assuming control containing the declaration under entry of $$$ i must spell out the limit of control so assumed by the declaration. therefore the degree and extent of control that would be acquired by parliament pursuant to the declaration would necessarily depend upon the legislation enacted spelling out the degree of control assumed. in belsund $$$ supra of the controversies raised related to a conflict between the provisions of the markets $$$ and the tea $$$. there too the tea $$$ envisaged that an order might be passed under section relating to the sale and purchase f tea. the contention that the mere possibility of issuance of such a control order under section of the tea $$$ was sufficient to oust the state legislature from the field was negatived in the following words..mere possibility of issuance of any future order under section of the tea $$$ by the central government in the absence of any existing express order to that effect can not be said to have occupied the field regarding purchase and sale of manufactured tea and fixation of maximum or minimum price thereof or the location of such sales. these topics can not be said to be legitimately convened by the tea $$$. hence the field is wide open for the state legislature to exercise its concurrent legislative power under entry of $$$ $$$i for effectively dealing with these matters. therefore even if n were to concede that there is a conflict between the provisions in the markets $$$ prohibiting sale of tobacco otherwise than in a market area and the setting up of auction platforms under the tobacco $$$ and between the states power to levy market fee under the markets $$$ and the levy of fee on the sale of tobacco under the tobacco $$$ at least in those states where sections and of the tobacco $$$ are not operative the provisions of the markets $$$ must prevail. it now remains for me to answer the question which was referred to this $$$ namely whether itc ltd. v. state of karnataka supra has been rightly decided. the majority opinion on the issued of legislative competence of the state legislature was delivered by $$$ $$$. in striking down that part of the karnataka markets $$$ which provided for the power to levy market fee on tobacco and its products the opinion was based on premises each of which do not appear to be in consonance with the law.  -the $$$ proceeded on the basis that the tobacco $$$ was wholly and solely relatable to entry of $$$. i have already given may reasons for holding that the tobacco $$$ in so far as it deals with the disposal of tobacco is not within entry of $$$ i. second -$$$ was relied on to hold that parliament had overriding power to legislate in exceptional cases in matters appearing in the state $$$. $$$ has no manner of application to the present dispute. it reads:"( parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of indian not included in a state notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the state $$$. the sub -$$$ only deals with the power of parliament to make laws in respect of union territories even in respect of matters enumerated in the state $$$.  -it was held to be well settled that where tow $$$s once passed by the parliament and the other by state legislature collide and there was no question of harmonizing them then the central legislation must prevail. what is well settled is that if the parliament and the state legislature enact conflicting legislation in respect of the same subject matter under an entry in the concurrent $$$ then only will the central legislation prevail. in other cases it will be a question of whether the conflicting legislation is referable to an exclusive entry under the state $$$ or the union $$$ after the determination of which the dominant legislation will prevail. fourth -it was said that if the minority view expressed by mukharji -$$$ were accepted it would amount to robbing the $$$ of its entire content and essential import by handing over the power of legislation to the state government which per se has been taken over by the parliament under $$$ by the $$$. mukharji -$$$ had in fact followed $$$ and held correctly that the tobacco $$$ and markets $$$ operated in their respective fields and that there was no repugnancy if both the $$$s were considered in the light of their respective true nature and character. $$$ and the other constitution $$$ decision following it were not even referred to by the majority. fifth -in determining the impact of entry of $$$ i vis a viz entry of $$$ the majority relied on decisions dealing with entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$. the scope of the entries are different and i agree with the view expressed in the opinion of my learned brother pattanaik $$$ that the decisions relied upon by the majority viz the $$$ rampur coal co. ltd. v. state of orissa $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ $$$ kedia v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 bharat cooking coal ltd. v. state of bihar $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/9 scc and state of orissa v. m.a. $$$ & co. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 are inapposite.the final premise on which the majority based their view that the states could not levy any market fee on tobacco was that since the assent of the president was not taken the karnataka markets $$$ was wholly incompetent. the view proceeds on a misinterpretation of $$$ which in any event has no application to this case. $$$ provides:"( where a law made by the legislature of a state with respect to of the matters enumerated in the concurrent $$$ contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the legislature of such state shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the president and has received his assent prevail in that state. the language is clear. it only deals with the question of supremacy and not competence. in respect of conflicting legislation under the concurrent $$$ if the state legislation has received the assent of the president it will prevail over the central legislation in that state. the $$$ does not provide that state legislation without the assent of the president is incompetent. in the circumstances i would hold that itc v. state of karnataka supra was wrongly decided and would for the reasons discussed uphold the competence of the state legislatures to levy market fee on tobacco.y.k. sabharwal $$$. the issue in these matters is about the validity and applicability of bihar agricultural produce markets $$$ and the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ to the extent these state legislations deal with sale of tobacco in market areas with particular reference to the levy thereupon of market fee after enactment of tobacco board $$$ parliamentary legislation. the same is the issue in respect of similar state legislations passed by state legislatures of uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh. these issues were subject matter of decision in itc ltd. and ors. v. state of karnataka and ors. supp. scc. we are required to determine whether itc 's case is correctly decided or not. that is a decision rendered by a $$$udge. $$$. the majority decided in favour of itc. later a $$$ of $$$udge expressed tentative view that the decision in itc 's case requires reconsideration. thus these matters are before this $$$. the arguments on behalf of the appellants contending that itc has been correctly decided have been led by mr. shanti bhushan followed and supported by other learned counsel appearing for union of india and the tobacco board. on behalf of the state of bihar and other parties contending the itc has not been correctly decided the arguments were led by mr r.k. $$$ followed and supported by other learned counsel appearing for other states and market committees. the answer to the question whether itc is correctly decided or not depends upon the scope of entry in union $$$ of the schedule of the constitution of india with particular reference to the meaning of the expression industries in the said entry as also in entry of the state $$$ of the schedule of the constitution.in itc 's case the majority held that the provisions of the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ are repugnant to the parliamentary legislation the tobacco board $$$ and therefore tobacco is liable to be removed from the schedule of that enactment. expressing the minority view sabyasachi mukharji $$$ held that the state legislation and the tobacco board $$$ can co -exist. the question to be determined is can state legislation and tobacco board $$$ co -exist in respect of sale of tobacco in the market areas within the framework of agricultural produce marketing $$$s -the state legislations under consideration if our answer to this question is that the legislations can co -exist in that event it may not be necessary to go into the aspect of legislative competence. if however our answer is that the state legislations and the parliamentary legislation are incapable of reconciliation and the can not co -exist in that case the next question that would require determination will be about the validity of the state legislations. in the proposed judgment hon'ble mr. $$$ustice pattanaik has come to the conclusion that the agricultural produce markets $$$ and the tobacco board $$$ are in direct collision with each other and can not be allowed to be operated simultaneously. the state legislations and parliamentary legislations can not co -exist is apparent from various provisions of the legislations. to illustrate in this regard reference may be made on hand to section of $$$ and similar provision in other state legislations and on the other to the provisions of section of the tobacco board $$$ in states wherein this section has been enforced and also to section. reference can also be made to $$$ of the tobacco board $$$s framed in exercise of powers conferred by section of the tobacco board $$$ regarding purchase of virginia tobacco in comparison to section of bihar $$$ requiring the agricultural produce which tobacco is to be brought to the market yard and sold by means of an auction or tender to the highest bidder. the power of the tobacco board to purchase from growers as provided in $$$ can not co -exist with sale by auction or tender. even in regard the price and manner of payment licensing and auction procedure under legislations and $$$s made thereunder show that they can not co -exist. in this regard reference can also be made to the tobacco board auction $$$s and tobacco board auction regulation. it is evident that the compliance with the provisions of would involve non -compliance of the provisions of the other. the provisions of the legislations have been referred to in the judgment of brother pattanaik $$$. i am in respectful agreement with the opinion of $$$ustice pattanaik that the can not operate and co -exist simultaneously. in this view the question about the legislative competence of the state legislatures will have to be examined. in itc 's case learned judge have held the state legislation to be invalid. the power of state legislature per se to legislate in respect of sale of tobacco in market areas and levy of market fee in view of $$$ read with entries and of the state $$$ is not in dispute. the dispute has however arisen as according to itc on declaration as contemplated by entry of the union $$$ having been made by the parliament in section of the tobacco board $$$ and as a result of various provisions in that $$$ the field of sale of tobacco which is said to be integral part of tobacco industry has been transferred from entry of the state $$$ to entry of the union $$$ entry being subject to the provisions of entries and of the union $$$. the contention is that in this view the state legislature is deprived of competence to legislate in the field of sale of tobacco in market area and levy market fee. under these circumstances the competence of the state legislature to legislate in regard to sale of tobacco would depend upon the answer to the question whether under entry of the union $$$ the parliament is competent or not to legislate in respect of sale of raw tobacco. if the answer to the question is that the parliament is competent in that eventually the state legislation will have to be invalidated for want of legislative competence. the answer to the question would however depend upon the scope of the expression industries ' as deployed in entry of the union $$$ and entry of the state $$$. if we find that the expression industries ' is wide enough to include the raw material of the industry and the parliament is thus competent to enact law under entry of the union $$$ in respect of raw material the parliament having supremacy as provided in $$$ the parliamentary legislation namely the tobacco board $$$ would hold the field and the state legislation invalidated. the dispute in this case is not about parliamentary supremacy as n has doubted it in view of $$$ of the constitution but is whether parliament has competence at all to legislate in respect of raw tobacco or it falls within the competence of state. if we hold that while legislating in the field of industry as provided in entry of the union $$$ the parliament is not competent to legislate in respect of the field anterior to industry i. its raw material and can legislate only in respect of the process of manufacture or production in that eventuality the state legislation will have to be held to be constitutional intra vires and applicable. in the proposed judgment $$$ustice pattanaik has held that the word industry in entry of the union $$$ can not be given restricted meaning so as to exclude from its purview the subject of legislation coming within entry or entry of $$$ and thus the parliamentary legislation namely the tobacco board $$$ is constitutionally valid and consequently the state legislations entitling the market committee to levy fee for sale and purchase of raw tobacco within the market area will not be operative so far as the produce of tobacco is concerned and that the majority judgment in the itc 's case is correctly decided. i express my respectful dissent with the view expressed by $$$ustice pattanaik on this aspect and thus this separate judgment. the parliament and assemblies draw power to legislate from the provisions of the constitution of india. we are concerned here with $$$. $$$ of the constitution provides that notwithstanding anything in clauses and parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$ in the schedule. the said $$$ is referred to in the constitution as the union $$$. entry in the union $$$ is industries the control of which by the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest. in respect of field covered by this entry the parliament has enacted the tobacco board $$$. section of the tobacco board $$$ contains the declaration that it is expedient in the public interest that the union should take under its control the tobacco industry. $$$ provides that notwithstanding anything in clause parliament and subject to clause the legislature of any state also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$i in the schedule. the said $$$ is referred to in the constitution as the concurrent $$$. $$$ provides that subject to clauses and the legislature of any state has exclusive power to make laws for such state or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$ in the schedule. the said $$$ is referred to in the constitution as the state $$$.in exercise of power under $$$ various state legislature have enacted agricultural produce marketing $$$s for regulating sale and purchase of the agricultural produce and levying market fee within the framework of those $$$s which inter alia permit levy and collection of market fee. the tobacco under the $$$s in question has been notified as an agricultural produce. in itc 's case by majority it was held that the tobacco industry having been taken over by the central government under entry of the union $$$ by enactment of tobacco board $$$ the state legislature ceases to have any jurisdiction to legislate for that filed and therefore the provisions of the karnataka agricultural produce and marketing $$$ entitling the market committee to levy market fee in respect of sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area collide with tobacco board $$$. thus the state $$$ so far as it relates to tobacco was struck down. the minority view was that both the state and the central $$$ can operate in their respective fields and there is no repugnancy if both the acts are considered in the light of their respective true nature and character. the majority judgment in itc 's case for the view that it took principally relied upon the constitution $$$ decisions of this $$$ in state of orissa v. m.a. $$$ and co. scr and $$$ $$$ v. state of bihar and ors. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9. referring to these decisions the opinion expressed was that these cases are direct authority on the question at issue viz.if the central $$$ and the state $$$ collide the inevitable consequence would have to be that the central $$$ will prevail over the state $$$ and later will have to yield and that the provisions of the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ are repugnant to the tobacco board $$$ and therefore tobacco is liable to be removed from the schedule of the said $$$. the minority view however was that there is nothing in the state $$$ or in the $$$s which indicate that it is inconsistent with or can not be operated along with the marketing regulations and both the $$$s can operate in their respective fields and there is no repugnancy if both the $$$s are considered in the light of their true nature and character. in itc 's case the challenge was to the constitutional validity of the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation amendment $$$. by the amending $$$ tobacco was enumerated as an agricultural produce for the purposes of the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$. the high $$$ was of the view that the tobacco board $$$ did not cover the marketing o tobacco in its entirety but only covered a part of the area of the topic of marketing of tobacco and that the legislations namely the tobacco board $$$ and the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ can co -exist and operate cumulatively. the further view expressed by the high $$$ was that any intention of the superior legislature to cover the whole field to make a comprehensive law with regard to marketing of tobacco was not manifest in the legislation. the contention canvassed before this $$$ in itc 's case was that in view of the central $$$ the state legislature was not competent to bring into fold of the state $$$ the tobacco the matter being covered by entry of the union $$$ of schedule of the constitution of india. the precise question in itc 's case was as to whether in respect of marketing of tobacco the state government was entitled to legislate or whether in view of the fact that there was a declaration under entry of the union $$$ the state legislature had no competence to legislate on tobacco and as such the impugned legislation was ultra vires. in the minority opinion mukharji $$$. noticed that the karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ deals with the subject of market in entry read with entry of $$$ and that it had to be borne in mind that entry is not subject to withdrawal to $$$ i by parliament. the state $$$ is not on a subject in $$$i nor is the central $$$ a law relating to any subject in $$$. it was concluded that therefore there can not be any question of repugnancy. the nature and character of the $$$s namely karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ and the central $$$ was noticed and it was held that it is fully manifest that both the $$$s can operate in their respective fields. further in the minority opinion it was observed that while giving due weight to center 's supremacy in the matter of legislation the states ' legitimate sphere of legislation should not be unnecessarily whittled down because that would be unwarranted by the spirit and basic purpose of the constitutional division of powers -not merely allocation of power by the constitution but invasion by parliamentary legislations. while it is true that in the spheres very carefully delineated the parliament has supremacy over state legislatures supremacy in the sense that in those fields parliamentary legislation would hold the field and not the state legislation to denude the state legislature of its power to legislate where the legislation in question in pith and substance i. in its true nature and character belongs to the state field should be chary to denude the state of its powers to legislate and mobilize resources -because that would be destructive of the spirit and purpose of india being a union of states. states must have power to raise and mobilize resources in their exclusive fields. the marketing $$$ is essentially an $$$ to regulate the marketing of agricultural produce. $$$ustice mukharji said that it must therefore be held that the state $$$ should prevail.  should avoid corroding the state 's ambit of powers of legislation which will ultimately lead to erosion of india being a union of state.. the majority opinion was expressed by $$$ustice s. murtaza $$$ with whom $$$ustice a. $$$ concurred. in the majority opinion after noticing the crucial point for determination i. whether the karnataka state had any jurisdiction to encroach upon the limits of entry of the union $$$ relying inter ali upon the decisions in the cases of $$$ $$$ $$$ it was concluded that once the center takes over an industry under entry of $$$ i of the schedule and passes an $$$ to regulate the legislation the state legislature ceases to have any jurisdiction to legislate in that field and if it does so that legislation would be ultra vires the powers of the state legislature. it was further observed that acceptance of the minority opinion would rob the central $$$ of its entire content and essential import by handing over he power of legislation to the state government which per se had been taken over by the parliament under $$$ by enacting the tobacco board $$$. in the majority opinion reliance was placed on the following passage of $$$ $$$ 's case as extracted at page as under.it is open to parliament to declare that it is expedient in the public interest that the control should rest in central government. to what extent such a declaration can go is for parliament to determine and this must be commensurate with public interest. once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by parliament. any legislation by the state after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessary be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the state legislature. this proposition is also self -evident that no attempt was rightly made to contradict it. the majority opinion has not noticed the constitution $$$ 's decision in the case of ch. $$$ and ors. etc. v. the state of uttar pradesh and ors. $$$ / sc/000$$$$/$$$ / sc/000$$$$/ decisions on the scope o entry but relying upon m.a. $$$ and $$$ kedio held that when declaration under entry of $$$ i in respect of public interest is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject of legislation by the parliament and any legislation by the state after such declaration trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the state legislature. thus it was held that the government of karnataka had no jurisdiction to levy and market fee on tobacco because the state $$$ to that extent collides with the central $$$ of. the decision in the cases of$$$ and $$$ have also been relied upon by mr. shanti bhushan. reliance has also been placed by learned counsel on the $$$ -rampur coal co. ltd. and ors. v. state of orissa and ors. $$$ / sc/00/0$$$ / sc/00/0. it was contended by mr. shanti bhushan that in law and in principle there would be no difference in respect of a case dealing with the scope of entry of the union $$$ or a case dealing with the scope of entry of that $$$. the submission of learned counsel is that for the purpose of interpretation both these entries have been equated by this $$$ and reliance in this regard is place don $$$ p ltd. and ors. v. state of uttar pradesh and ors. $$$ / sc/009/9$$$$0$$$ / sc/009/9$$$$0. on behalf of the state governments and the agricultural produce marketing committees strong reliance has been placed on $$$ 's case. what is the ratio of these decisions we will now examine. before considering the affronted decisions it would be appropriate to make it clear that in these matters it has to be kept in view that this $$$ is not examining a case where the field of legislation is on concurrent list to which $$$ applies. this $$$ is also not considering the case of an incidental trenching of field by or the other legislature. the $$$ is concerned with the question of legislative competence. we are examining a case where what has been questid is the legality of legislation is respect of a field on the state $$$ to which $$$ applies. the validity and applicability of the state legislations in respect of a field of legislation on state $$$ has come under a cloud on account of a legislation passed by the parliament in respect of field of legislation under entry of the union $$$ namely the tobacco board $$$. it is on account of this legislation containing declaration as contemplated by entry of the union $$$ that doubts have arisen about the validity and applicability of state legislation about the sale of agricultural produce of tobacco in market areas and levy thereupon of market fee which aspect are on field of legislation on the state $$$ entries and. entry of the state $$$ is subject to entries and of $$$ i. we are not concerned in these matter with entry. the question here is as to the effect of transfer of field of legislation under entry of the state $$$ to the union $$$ entry on other fields in the state $$$ namely fields of legislation under entries and and what is fact can be transferred. $$$ was a case which considered the validity of the state legislation on the ground of being beyond the state legislative power n view of the declaration by the parliament in mines and minerals regulation and development $$$. and contemplated by entry of $$$ i of the schedule to the constitution. section of the central legislation declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the union should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided therein. entry of the union $$$ speaks both of regulation of mines and minerals development and entry of the state $$$ is subject to entry. it was held that it was open to the parliament to declare that it is expedient in the public interest that the control should rest with the central government. to what extent such a declaration can go is for the parliament to determine and this must be commensurate with public interest. once this declaration is made and that extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for the legislation by the parliament. any legislation by the state after such declaration trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the state legislature. for its view the constitution $$$ followed earlier constitution $$$ decisions in the cases of $$$ and $$$. these cases also dealt with the scope of entry of $$$ i viz -a -viz entry of $$$. the majority opinion in itc as already noticed followed $$$ $$$ and extracted in its judgment the passage as aforesaid. a significant aspect to take note of is that $$$ 's case has not been considered in $$$ 's case. the reason for it seems to be that set of cases consider the scope of entry viz -a -viz entry and to that category belong the cases of $$$ $$$ and $$$ $$$. the other set of cases consider the scope of entry of union $$$ viz -a -viz entry of the state $$$ and to that category belong the cases of $$$ and other cases following $$$. relying upon $$$ 's case mr. shanti bhushan contends that entry has been equated with entry of the union $$$. both sides have relied upon the case of $$$. let us examine that case. in ishwari khetan 's case the contention urged was that the parliament has made the industrial development and regulation $$$ for short the idr $$$ in entry $$$ i declaring control of sugar industry and that industry goes out of entry of $$$ and therefore state legislature is denuded of legislative powers in respect of sugar industry and impugned legislation was with respect to acquisition of sugar undertaking is sugar industry. the attorney general and contended that the power to acquire property was derived from entry of $$$. ishwari khetan 's case involved the determination or scope of entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ only. the scope of these entries with respect to entries and of $$$ and entry of $$$i did not fall for consideration. further in paragraphs and of ishwari khetan 's case the constitution $$$ repeatedly pointed out that a declaration in entry of $$$ i denudes the power of state legislature to legislate under entry $$$ only. it was noticed that the sugar was a declared industry. the question posed was that is it however correct to say that once a declaration is made as envisaged by entry $$$ i that industry as a whole is taken out of entry of $$$ the answer given by the constitutional $$$ was that it is not correct to say that once a declaration is made in respect of an industry that industry as a whole is taken our of entry $$$. it was said that the industry as a legislative head is found itself placed in entry of $$$. the state legislature can be denied legislative power under entry to the extent parliament makes declaration under entry and by such declaration parliament acquired power to legislate only in respect of those industries in respect of which declaration is made and to that extent as manifested by legislation incorporating the declaration and not more. the $$$ further said that the legislative power of the state under entry $$$ is eroded only to the extent the control is assumed by the union pursuant to the declaration and the state legislature which is otherwise competent to deal with industry under entry $$$ can deal with that industry in exercise of other powers enabling it to legislate under different heads set out in $$$ and $$$i and this power can not be denied to the state. the extent of parliamentary legislation was seen only to determine how much is taken out from entry $$$ and not for the purposes of laying down any principle that the $$$ legislation has to be seen to determine the extent of control and the denudation of the power of the state legislature to the extent the control is laid down by the parliament. further it was held that despite the parliamentary legislation the state legislature can deal with industry in exercise of other powers in different entries in $$$ and $$$i and that power can not be denied to the state in this case the $$$ was examining whether the law of acquisition of sugar undertaking was referable to entry $$$ or entry $$$. it was concluded that the acquisition of the property was referable to entry $$$. the scope of the industry did not fall for examination in ishwari khetan 's case. there is no discussion on the interpretation of expression industry and that probably is the reason why $$$ 's case has not been referred to. the reliance on $$$ $$$ 's case in ishwari khetan 's case was to show the denudation of states ' power being limited to the extent of control. while $$$ $$$ 's case dealt with entry $$$ ishwari khetan 's case dealt with entry $$$. the subject matter of the other entries was not in issue in this decision. the structure in entry of $$$ i was not equated with that of entry $$$ i as contended by mr. shanti bhushan. this decision does not adopt the mines and minerals cases for the purposes of considering the scope of entry of $$$ i. in our view the cases of mines and minerals are not of much assistance while examining the scope of entry of $$$ i. in state of a.p. and ors. v. $$$ & co. and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ also it was held that the ambit and scope of a constitutional entry can not be determined with reference to a parliamentary enactment. if it is otherwise it would result in the parliament enacting and/or amending an enactment thereby controlling the ambit and scope of the constitutional provision. that can not be the law. the power to legislate with which we are concerned in contained in $$$. the fields are demarcated in the various entries. on reading both it has to be decided whether the concerned legislature is competent to legislate when its validity is questid. the ambit and scope of an entry can not be determined with reference to a parliamentary enactment. $$$ 's case is required to be examined in some detail since that has been a b of serious and elaborate submissions. in that case the challenge by the $$$ growers hailing from several villages of state of u.p. was to the validity of the up $$$cane regulation of supply and purchase $$$ and notifications issued thereunder. a short history of legislation enacted by the center as well as the province of u.p. in regard to $$$ and $$$cane was noticed. it was noticed that on th april the central legislature passed the $$$cane industry protection $$$. as a result of this $$$ there was a rapid rise in number of sugar factories as also a large expansion in the cultivation of sugarcane. to regulate the price at which sugarcane intended to be used in the manufacture of sugar might be purchased by or for the factories the central legislature enacted on st may the $$$cane $$$. the fixing of minimum price for the purchase of sugarcane intended for use in any factory in any controlled area was left to the provincial governments which were empowered to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of the $$$ including the organisation of growers of sugarcane into co -operative societies for the sale of sugarcane to factories. with the coming into operation of the government of india $$$ there was distribution of legislative power between the $$$ legislature and the provincial legislatures and agriculture entry no. trade and commerce within the province entry no. and production supply and distribution of goods development of industries subject to the provision in $$$ i with respect to development of certain industries under $$$ control entry no. were included in $$$ namely the provincial legislative $$$. entry no. in $$$ i was development of industries where development under $$$ control is declared to be in the public interest. the result of above distribution of legislative power was that the entire subject matter of the $$$cane $$$ was left with the provincial legislative list. it was left that this $$$ was not sufficiently comprehensive for dealing with the problems of sugar industry. therefore it was found necessary to replace it so as to provide for better organisation of cane supplies to sugar factories. the u.p. legislature accordingly enacted on 0th $$$$ the u.p. $$$ factories control $$$ to provide for licensing of the sugar factories and for regulating the supply of sugarcane intended for use in such factories and the price at which it may be purchased and for other incidental matters and repealed the $$$cane $$$. the $$$ was to remain in force initially upto 0th $$$une but the period was extended to 0th $$$une and then to 0th $$$une. on intervention of section world war a proclamation of emergency was issued by the governor general under section of the government of india $$$. the $$$ acquired the power to make laws for the provinces with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the provincial legislative $$$. the proclamation of emergency was to operate until revoked by a subsequent proclamation and the laws made by the $$$ were to have effect until the expiration of period of months after the proclamation had ceased to operate. the defence of india $$$ and the $$$s made thereunder occupied the filed. $$$ was made a controlled commodity in the year and its production and distribution as well as the fixation of sugar prices were regulated by the $$$ controller thereafter. the proclamation of emergency was revoked on st april and the laws made by $$$ in the field of the provincial legislative $$$ were to cease to have effect after 0th september. on th march the british parliament enacted the india central government and legislature $$$ section whereof provided that notwithstanding anything in the government of india $$$ the indian legislature shall during the period mentid in section thereof have powers to make laws with respect to the following matters:"(a trade and commerce whether or not within a province in and the production supply and distribution of cotton and woollen textiles paper including newsprint foodstuffs including edible oil seeds and oils petroleum and petroleum products spare parts of mechanically propelled vehicles coal iron steel and mica.. $$$ing under the power reserved to it under the aforesaid section the central legislature enacted on 9th november the essential supplies temporary powers $$$ to provide for the continuance during the limited period of powers to control production supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in certain commodities. the governor general issued a notification on rd march the effect whereof was to continue the $$$ till st march. on th $$$uly however indian independence $$$ was passed under which the governor general passed an order which substituted the words dominion legislature for both houses of parliament in the proviso to section of india central government and legislature $$$ and also introduced a new section by way of adoption providing that the powers of the dominion legislature shall be exercised by the constituent assembly. by passing of the resolution by the constituent assembly the life of the $$$ was extended and later on constitution coming into force the parliament was invested with power under $$$ for a period of years to make laws with respect to the following matters as if they were enumerated in the concurrent $$$.a trade and commerce within a state in and the production supply and distribution of.. foodstuffs including edible oil seeds and oil..the life of the $$$ was accordingly extended from time to time upto th $$$anuary by $$$s passed by parliament. food crops under the aforesaid $$$ were defined as including corps of sugarcane. the central government in exercise of powers conferred upon it by section of the $$$ promulgated the sugar and gur control order inter alia empowering it to prohibit or restrict the export of sugarcane from any area to direct that no gur or sugar shall be manufactured from sugarcane except under and in accordance with the conditions specified in the licence issued in this behalf. there was also power to fix minimum price in exercise whereof the central government from time to time issued notifications fixing the minimum price to be paid by the producers of sugar for sugarcane purchased by them. on st october parliament enacted the industries development and regulation $$$ to provide for the development and regulation of certain industries. by section of the $$$ it was declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the union should take in its control the industries specified in the schedule. that schedule included the industry engaged in the manufacture or production of sugar. the u.p. legislature enacted the impugned $$$. the object of this enactment was stated to be as $$$ the promulgation of the industries development and regulation $$$ with effect from th may the regulation of the sugar industry has become exclusively as central subject. the state government are now only concerned with the supply of sugarcane to the sugar factories. the $$$ is being introduced in order to provide for a rational distribution of sugarcane to factories or its development on organized scientific lines to protect the interests of the cane growers and the industry and to put the new $$$ permanently on the statute book. in exercise of the rule making power conferred by the impugned $$$ the u.p. government made rules and also promulgated the u.p. $$$ supply and purchase order. all these related to the supplies and purchase of sugarcane in u.p. challenging vires of the state $$$ of the submissions made in $$$ 's case before the constitution $$$ was:"( that the state of u.p. had no power to enact the impugned $$$ as the $$$ is with respect to the subject of industries the control of which by the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest within the meaning of entry of $$$ i and is therefore within the exclusive province of parliament. the impugned $$$ is therefore ultra vires the powers of the state legislature and is a colourable exercise of legislative power by the state. it was urged that the word industry was a word of very wide import and included not only the process of manufacture or production but also of things which were necessarily incidental to it viz.the raw materials for the industry as also the products of that industry and would therefore include within its connotation the production the supply and distribution of raw materials for that industry which meant sugarcane i n relation to sugar industry and therefore insofar as the impugned $$$ purported to legislate in regard to sugarcane which was a necessary ingredient in the production of sugar it was a colourable exercise of legislative power by the state ostensibly operating in its own filed within entry of $$$ but really trespassing upon the field of entry of $$$ i. true the challenge was to the vires of the state legislation and not to the parliamentary legislation but at the same time the entire basis of challenge was that in respect of the sugarcane only parliament had the power to legislate on account of the filed being covered under entry of $$$ i the sugar industry having been included in that entry and the connotation of industry being very wide to include in it raw material i.sugarcane as well. thus the exclusive power of parliament to legislate was urged as the main ground to seek invalidation of the state legislation the filed of sugarcane not being available to the state legislature to legislate. in view of the controversy as aforesaid the fact that the validity of the parliamentary legislation was not in issue in $$$ 's case does not in any manner affect the ratio of that decision. the point for determination in that case was substantially the same as in the present case namely the scope of the expression industries in entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$. there also the point was to adopt a narrow or wide interpretation of the expression industry. further the fact that it was a case of a manufacturing industry under idr $$$ also does not affect the ratio of the case. the interpretation placed in $$$ 's case can not be confined to industry falling under idr $$$ al. there is neither any express or implied indication in that decision to limit the interpretation nor there is any valid reason to so limit it. like $$$ 's case in these matters the challenge is to the state legislations on the ground that in view of entry of $$$ i on enactment of tobacco board $$$ the state legislature loses competence to legislate in respect of sale of tobacco and therefore the existing state legislations will have no applicability and thus the legislations in respect of marketing under entry of $$$ would have no applicability insofar as it concerns the agricultural produce tobacco. the opposite contention is that under entry of the state $$$ the state is competent to legislate in respect of agricultural produce and tobacco is an agricultural produce setting up of markets in respect of this produce under entry and levying thereupon the fee under entry and subject to entry of $$$ production supply and distribution of goods entry are all state subjects and that under entry of $$$ i the parliament 's competence is only to legislate in respect of industry which would not include in its ambit the raw material of the industry and that the process of sale of agricultural produce of tobacco in markets and levying thereupon market fee can never be part of industrial process which is only manufacture and production. the contention of mr. $$$ is that state 's activity in question is not an industrial activity and therefore it is outside the ambit of entry of state $$$ and entry of the union $$$. in $$$ 's case the precise argument to challenge the state enactment was that the expression industries should be construed as including not only the process of manufacture or production but also activities antecedents thereto such as acquisition of raw material and subsequent thereto such as disposal of the finished products of that industry. it was urged in that case that the process of acquiring raw materials was an integral part of the industrial process and was therefore included in the connotation of the word industry and when the central legislature was invested with the power to legislate in regard to sugar industry on account of declaration as postulated by entry of $$$ i that legislative power included also the power to legislate in regard to the raw material of the sugar industry that is sugarcane and the production supply and distribution of sugarcane was by reason of its being the necessary ingredient in the process of manufacture or production of sugar within the legislative competence of the central legislature. the petitirs in $$$ 's case in support of the wide construction to be placed upon the expression industry also relied upon various decisions interpreting the said term in relation to the industrial disputes $$$. dealing with those cases in $$$ 's case this $$$ said:"what we are concerned with here is not the wide construction to be put on the term industry as such but whether the raw materials of an industry which form an integral part of the process are within the topic of industry which forms the subject matter of item of $$$ i as ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly or reasonably be said to be comprehended in that topic and whether the central legislature while legislating upon sugar industry could acting within the sphere of entry of $$$ i as well legislate upon sugarcane. this $$$ said that if the legislation with regard to sugarcane came within the exclusive province of the central legislature under entry of $$$ i the enactment passed by the provincial legislature would be ultra vires. it was said if both the central legislature and the provincial legislature were entitled to legislate in regard to this subject of production supply and distribution of sugarcane there would arise no question of legislative competence of the provincial legislature in the matter of having enacted the impugned $$$. the conflict if any arose by reason of the interpretation which was sought to be put on the entries entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ put in juxtaposition with each other. it was suggested that item of $$$ i comprised not only legislation in regard to sugar industry but also in regard to sugarcane which was an essential ingredient of the industrial process of the manufacture or production of sugar and was therefore ancillary to it and was covered within the topic. if legislation with regard to sugarcane thus came within the exclusive province of the central legislature the provincial legislature was not entitled to legislate upon the same by having resort to entry of $$$ and the impugned $$$. dealing with the argument of wide import of the expression industries in $$$ 's case it was held that industry in its wide sense of the term would be capable of comprising different aspects raw materials which are an integral part of the industrial process the process of manufactures or production and the distribution of the products of the industry. after noticing these different aspects of the term industry it was held that the raw materials would be goods which would be comprised in entry of $$$. in respect of the category of process of manufacture or production and the aspect of distribution of the product of the industry the $$$ held the process of manufacture or production would be comprised in entry of $$$ except where the industry was a controlled industry when it would fall within entry of $$$ i and the products of the industry would also be comprised in entry of $$$ except where they were the products of the controlled industries when they would fall within entry of $$$. the $$$ further held that in no event could the legislation in regard to sugar and sugarcane be thus included within entry of $$$ i. thus rejecting the contention that the expression industries in entry of $$$ i is wide enough to take into its compass the power to legislate in respect of raw material said to be an integral part of the industrial process the $$$ repelled the plea of the state $$$ being ultra vires the same being covered by the subject of sugar industry control whereof have been declared by the parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest under the exclusive domain of parliament. in the $$$ gas company proprietary ltd. v. the state of west bengal and ors. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 the challenge was to the constitutional validity of the oriental gas company $$$. of the ground of challenge was that the west bengal legislature was not competent to make a law regulating the gas industry in view of declaration as contemplated by entry of $$$ i having being made by the parliament in idr $$$ entry being subject to the provisions of entry of $$$ i. it was contended that entry of $$$ gas & gas works must be confined to matters other than those covered by entry of the same $$$. on the facts of the case and in view of the conclusions of the constitution $$$ on other aspect it was not considered necessary to attempt to define the expression industry precisely or the state exhaustively all its ingredients but following $$$ 's case it was assumed that the expression industry means only production or manufacture. in $$$ gas which considers entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ the $$$ said that ordinarily industry is in the field of the state legislation and in all the entries it must be given the same meaning and cited with approval $$$ 's case in the following words:"in $$$ v. state of uttar pradesh the expression industries is defined to mean the process of manufacture or production and does not include the raw materials used in the industry or the distribution of the products of the industry. it was contended that the word industry was a word of wide import and should be construed as including not only the process of manufacture or production but also activities antecedent thereto such as acquisition of raw materials and subsequent thereto such as disposal of the finished products of that industry. but that contention was not accepted. mr. shanti bhushan however contends that once field is covered by entry by issue of requisite declaration and the parliament has actually covered the field by enacting a legislation with regard to that extent the industry including all facets of such an industry whether it is the raw materials or the products of that industry the state legislature will have no power to legislate. the contention is that the expression industries in entry of the union $$$ comprises in it all its aspects commencing from procurement of raw material and upto disposal of final product of that industry and not only the process of manufacture or production. the submission of learned counsel is that if the expression industries in the entries under consideration is not given such interpretation it would denude the parliament of real object of control of such industry in public interest which is of paramount importance. as against this the contention of the other side is that the acceptance of the viewpoint propounded by mr. shanti bhushan would mean denuding the state legislature the power to legislate in respect of fields covered under various entries under the state $$$ which are not made subject to any other entry and that the acceptance of contention of mr. shanti bhushan would have the effect of rewriting the constitution. i agree. the intention of the constitution makers was not to make entries and subject to entry of the union $$$. the acceptance of viewpoint propounded by mr. shanti bhushan will have that effect. therefore the expression industries can not be interpreted in the manner suggested. true the parliamentary legislation has supremacy as provided under $$$ and. this is of relevance when field of legislation is on concurrent list. while maintaining parliamentary supremacy can not give go by to the federalism which has been held to be a basic feature of the constitution see s.r. $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99. the constitution of india deserves to be interpreted language permitting in a manner that it does not whittle down the powers of state legislature and preserves the federalism while also upholding the central supremacy as contemplated by some of its articles. in this background let us also briefly notice the constitutional history and structural inter -relationship in respect of relevant entries as they existed in government of india $$$ and as they now exist in the schedule. entries and on the state $$$ in the government of india $$$ were as under:"item. trade and commerce within the province markets and fairs my lending and my lenders.item. production supply and distribution of goods development of industries subject to the provisions in $$$ i with respect to the development of certain industries under federal control. now in schedule part of entry is in entry of the state $$$ markets and fairs is entry of $$$ my lending and my lenders entry $$$ production supply and distribution of gods subject to the provisions to entry of $$$i entry $$$ industries subject to the provisions of entries and of $$$ i entry $$$. it would thus be seen that under $$$ both production supply and distribution of goods as well as development of industries were subject to the provisions of $$$ i as provided in entry. our constitution makers however bifurcated entry into parts. industries were put in entry of $$$ $$$ subject to the provisions of entries and of $$$ i. the production supply and distribution of goods was put in entry of $$$ $$$ and made subject to entry of $$$. the acceptance of the argument of mr. shanti bhushan would mean that no object was sought to be achieved by such a bifurcation. it is clear that entries have been separated. made subject to the provisions of entry of $$$ and the other subject to the provisions of entries and of $$$ i. therefore to interpret the expression industry to include in it the aspect of raw material would mean that by the same analogy the subject matter of production supply and distribution of goods should also be included therein and in fact that was the argument of mr. shanti bhushan. would the acceptance of that argument not negate the will of the constitution makers. i think it would. therefore the argument can not be accepted. the same argument would equally apply to entry of $$$ $$$ in respect of agriculture which is not subject to any $$$. it would so become if we accept the contention of mr. shanti bhushan. further earlier when the parliament felt the need to control raw material it included raw jute and raw cotton in entry $$$ by constitution amendment $$$. even $$$ indicates that agricultural raw material is in the state $$$ for it refers to raw cotton cotton seed and edible oil seeds and seeks to temporarily place it by fiction in the concurrent list to enable parliament to make laws. the expression industries in entry $$$ $$$ or entry $$$ i can not be interpreted in a manner that would make other entries of $$$ $$$ of the schedule subject to union control which in fact they are not. wherever it was intended to be made subject to such control whether of $$$ i or that of $$$ it was said so. a perusal of $$$ $$$ shows that whenever a particular entry was intended to be made subject to an entry in $$$ it has been so stated specifically. therefore an interpretation which tends to have the effect of making a particular entry subject to any other entry though not so stated in the entry deserves to be avoided unless that be the only possible interpretation. we do not think that such an interpretation on the entries in question namely entry of the union $$$ and entry of the state $$$ deserves to be placed. the principles of interpretation are well settled. there is no doubt that the entries in the lists in the schedule do not provide competence or power to legislate on the legislature for which the source of power is contained in $$$ of the constitution. in deciding question of legislative competence it has to be kept in view that the constitution is not required to be considered with a narrow or pedantic approach. it is not to be construed as a mere law but as a machinery by which laws are made. the interpretation should be broad and liberal. the entries only demarcate the legislative field of respective legislature and do not confer legislative power as such and if it is found that some of the entries overlap or in conflict with the other an attempt to reconcile such entries and bring about a harmonious construction is the duty of the court. when however reconciliation is not possible as here then the court will have to examine the entries in relation to legislative power in the constitution. the subject matter of the issue here is about the interpretation of entry in $$$ i of the schedule. it requires the parliament to make a declaration by law identifying an industry the control of which by the union is expedient in the public interest. under the said entry only an industry can be declared as an industry the control whereof by the union is regarded as expedient in public interest. it is therefore implicit that if an activity can not be regarded as industry entry will have no applicability to that activity. the question is about the concept of industry in entry of $$$ i. as already stated the entries in the legislative $$$ have to be construed in the widest sense can not be disputed but it has also to be borne in mind that such construction should not make other entries totally redundant. the meaning of the word industry in various dictionaries reliance on which was placed by mr. shanti bhushan is not of any assistance while considering the constitutional meaning of the said term. there may not be any embargo to limitation on the power of the parliament to enact the law in respect of activities other than manufacturing activities but that power is non -existence in entry of $$$ i. it may be elsewhere. reference in this regard can be made to entry of $$$ including in its ambit food stuff and certain raw materials. tobacco however is admittedly not a food stuff. the validity of certain other acts such as the cardamom $$$ the central silk board $$$ the coffee $$$ the rubber $$$ the tea $$$ the coir industry $$$ and the coconut development board $$$ reference whereof was made by mr. shanti bhushan need not be examined for purposes of considering the legislative competence of the impugned state legislations. the legislative competence of parliament to legislate these statutes is not in issue before this $$$ and therefore we do not think it necessary to examine the question of legislative competence only from academic view point insofar as these legislations are concerned. however prima facie there is no substance in the apprehension expressed by mr. shanti bhushan that narrow approach of the concept of industry would make these acts beyond the legislative competence of the parliament and make them ultra vires. as when and it these acts are challenged the question of legislative competence would be examined. further it may be noted that out of the aforesaid legislations namely the coffee $$$ and the rubber $$$ are pre -constitution enactments made under the government of india $$$ where the entries were different. item of $$$ $$$ of the said $$$ has already been reproduced above. in respect of the coir industry $$$ on examination of the provisions contained therein it may be possible to urge that the statute deals with the process of manufacturing and does not seek to control plantation and preservation of the coconut trees or the production of the coconut. the central silk board $$$ has been dealt with by this $$$ in the case of b. vishwanathiah & co. and ors. v. state of karnataka and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 and i fail to appreciate how upholding the validity of the agricultural produce marketing $$$s would effect the validity of this enactment. in respect of cardamom $$$ it appears that the said $$$ is being applied for export purposes and it does not cover soil preparation of seed -lings. regarding coconut development $$$ it does not envisage setting up of auction platform and controlling marketing as in the present case. that enactment primarily deals with the field pertaining to recommendation for improving marketing providing financial assistance for adoption of modern technology and for assisting growers to get incentive prices. this $$$ however need not examine in detail the aspect of legislative competence in regard to these enactments since as already said that is not the matter in issue here and it would suffice to indicate as above only the prima facie view to dispel the apprehension expressed by mr. shanti bhushan. harakchand $$$ and ors. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 has been strongly relied upon by mr. shanti bhushan to support the contention of wide interpretation of the expression industry. the main question therein was about the legislative competence of the parliament to enact the gold control $$$. the said $$$ defines gold to mean gold including its alloy whether virgine melted or re -melted wrought or unwrought in any shape or form of a purity of not less than carats and including primary gold article and ornament section. clause of section defines ' primary gold to mean gold in any unfinished or semi -finished form and includes ingots bars blocks slabs billets shots pellets rods sheets foils and wires. challenging the constitutional validity of the gold control $$$ the contention urged was that the goldsmiths was a handicraft requiring application of skill and the art of making ornament was not an industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ i of the schedule of the constitution. the constitution $$$ noticed the established principles that the widest aptitude should be taken of all the entries and the duty of the court to reconcile the entries and bring about a harmonious construction in case some entries in different list or in the same list may overlap or may appear to be in direct conflict with each other. in the present case however there is no question of any overlapping and in regard to conflict and harmonious construction it is mr. shanti bhushan 's own submission that the legislations to the extent this $$$ is concerned can not co -exist. reliance has been placed by mr. shanti bhushan on the following passage from $$$ 's case:"but we are satisfied in the present case that the manufacture of gold ornaments by goldsmiths in india is a process of systematic production for trade or manufacture and so falls within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entries. it follows therefore that in enacting the impugned $$$ parliament was validly exercising its legislative power in respect of matters covered by entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$. the contention of learned counsel is that in harakchand ratanchand $$$ 's case the process of systematic production for trade or manufacture has been held to fall within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entry and the argument that if the word industry is construed in the wide sense entry of $$$ $$$ will lose all meaning and content was rejected. the submission is that the same approach deserves to be adopted in the present case as well. the above approach was adopted after finding the activity to be manufacture or production and therefore falling within the connotation of industry. in $$$ 's case the constitution $$$ in fact cited with the approval $$$ 's case and referred thereto as under:"in $$$ v. state of uttar pradesh the expression industry was defined to mean the process of manufacture or production and did not include raw materials used in the industry or the distribution of the products of the industry. in $$$ 's case the $$$ was considering the validity of the $$$ the object whereof was to control production manufacture supply distribution use and possession of and business in gold ornaments and articles of gold and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. there is no provision in the gold control $$$ regulating the manner in which the primary gold would be extracted from the earth. the $$$ does not concern itself with the extraction of primary gold. the question therein was as to whether the work of goldsmiths was a handicraft requiring application of skill and whether the art of making gold ornaments was not in industry within the meaning of entry $$$ i. in that case the question was not whether dealing with the raw material of industry would come or not within the concept of industry. further the $$$ observed that it is not necessary to attempt to define the expression industry precisely or to state exhaustively all its different aspects. on the facts of the case the constitution $$$ held that the process or systematic production of gold ornament by goldsmiths for trade or manufacture falls within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entry. the decision in $$$ 's case was not departed from. in fact it was referred to. an attempt to adopt the definition of the word industry in the industrial disputes $$$ was repelled. the contention accepted was that the manufacture of gold ornament was an industry within the meaning of entry $$$ i. this decision is not of any assistance for determining whether sale of tobacco process can come within the of the tobacco industry so as to fall within the ambit of the word industry in entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ $$$. the observation in $$$ 's case that entry of $$$ $$$ was a general entry made in the context of manufacture of gold ornaments by goldsmiths falling within the ambit of the word industry as contained in entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$ i. $$$ 's case does not express any opinion on the scope of the word industry in entry of $$$ i and $$$ 's case still holds the field when it says that the expression industry would mean the process of manufacture or production and would not include any raw material used in an industry or the distribution of the products of industry.mr. shanti bhushan has also placed reliance on another decision of the constitution $$$ in the case of $$$. $$$ v. the union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 in particular to the observations made therein by sir $$$ chief $$$ustice in subramanyan chettiar v. $$$ fcr which have been cited in $$$ 's case. the said observations read thus:"it must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation though purporting to deal with a subject in list touches also on a subject in another list and the different provisions of the enactment may be so closely intertwined that blind adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation would result in a large number of statutes being declared invalid because the legislature enacting them may appear to have legislated in a forbidden sphere. reliance was also placed on the observations of $$$ustice hidayatullah in state of rajasthan v. g. chawla & anr. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 as cited with approval in the case of $$$. $$$.those observations are:"it is equally well -settled that the power to legislate on a topic of legislation carries with it the power to legislate on an ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included in the power given. we have no difficulty in accepting the aforesaid observations made by sir $$$ chief $$$ustice and hidayatullah $$$ as the then was but it has to be borne in mind that the question for determination in $$$. $$$ 's case was regarding true nature and character or the pith and substance of the impugned $$$ namely sections and of the central excuse and salt $$$ and $$$s to to and of the central excise $$$s the constitutional validity whereof was under challenge. the constitution $$$ was considering the constitutional validity of a fiscal measure to levy and realise duty on tobacco. the contention was that section and of the impugned $$$ and rules made thereunder were beyond the legislative competence of the central legislature under the government of india $$$. the $$$ was examining the question whether the impugned $$$ is a law with respect to matters enumerated in item of $$$ i under the $$$ or to the matters enumerated in items and of $$$ $$$. entries and have already been reproduced above. they dealt with the power of the state to legislate in respect of trade and commerce markets and fairs my lending and my -lenders. item dealt with power to legislate in respect of production supply and distribution of goods development of industries subject to the provisions in $$$ i with respect to the development of certain industries under the federal control. the question was whether the impugned $$$ in pith and substance relate to duties of excise on tobacco as contained in item or it falls within the boundaries of items and of the provincial $$$. referring to the decision of the federal $$$ it was held that in the interpretation of the scope of these items widest possible amplitude must be given to the words used and each general word must be held to extend to ancillary or subsidiary matters which can be fairly said to be comprehended in it. on examination of the provisions of the central excise $$$ the $$$ came to the conclusion that various provisions of the $$$ and the $$$s were essentially connected with the levying and collection of the excise duty and in its true nature and character the $$$ remains that falls under item of $$$ i and the incidental trenching upon the provisional field of items or would not affect the constitutionality because the extent of invasion of the provisional field may be a circumstance to determine the true pith and substance but once that question is determined the $$$ would fall on the side of central field and not that of the provincial field. it is thus evident that since in pith and substance the matter pertained to excise duty it fell under item of $$$ i and the non -tax entries in item or could not be invoked. in the constitution also entry relates to duty of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in india. referring to the argument of the petitir based on $$$ which dealt with revocation and suspension of licenses and empowered the licencing department to revoke or suspend a licence under certain circumstances and the argument that it was the field under the province of the provincial legislature the $$$ said that this rule may have an indirect effect of depriving an owner of a bonded warehouse from the privilege of keeping such a warehouse but that does not mean that the object of the $$$ is not imposition collection or realization of duty of excise. the rule was held to be a mean of making the realization of duty effective and necessarily incidental to effectual legislation for collection of duties. in the present case there is no question of any incidental trenching. it can not be said that the law relating to sale of tobacco in market area is incidental to law regarding tobacco as enacted by tobacco board $$$. the decision in chaturbal m. $$$ 's case in our opinion has no relevance for the present purpose and so also the decision in the case of state bank of india v. $$$a rao $$$ / sc/00/999$$$ / sc/00/999. the question squarely involved here is about the interpretation of the expression industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ $$$. in $$$ corporation ltd. v. state of u.p. and ors. $$$ / sc/09/99$$$ / sc/09/99 the constitutional validity of u.p. $$$ purchase $$$ was challenged on the ground that it invades entry of $$$ i with respect to sugar industry which is a controlled industry under the idr $$$. the question raised therein was this is the legislation ultra vires because the state enters the forbidden ground by enacting on controlled industry it was undisputed that sugar industry was a controlled industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ i of the schedule and therefore the legislative power of parliament covered enactments with respect to industries having regard to $$$ of the constitution. the $$$ said that if the impugned $$$ invades entry it must be repulsed by the $$$. the $$$ however expressed surprise at the argument of invalidity of the $$$ despite the decision of the constitution $$$ in $$$ 's case. the $$$ said that the constitution $$$ decision must be accepted as final unless the subject be of such fundamental importance to national life or the reasoning is so plainly errous in the light of later thought that it is wiser to be ultimately right rather than to be consistently wrong. it said that the pronouncement by the constitution $$$es should not be treated so cavalierly as to be revised frequently. recalling the words of chief justice $$$ of the u.s. supreme $$$ in smith v. alwright us at that adjudications of the $$$ were rapidly gravitating into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket good for $$$$ and train only. that part of $$$ 's case was referred which dealt with the contention regarding the word industry being of wide import and included not merely manufacture but also the raw material for the industry and rejection of this contention. paragraphs $$$$ and deal with $$$ 's case and rejection of the argument as to whether raw material of an industry which form an integral part of the process are within the topic of industry which forms the subject matter of item of $$$ i. the $$$ said:"the edifice of exclusive parliamentary jurisdiction so built stood on shifting sands. the semantic sweep of entry did not come in the way of the state legislature making laws on subjects within its sphere and not directly going to the heart of the industry itself. the submission of mr. shanti bhushan who appeared in $$$ corporation 's case also to reconsider $$$ 's case was rejected. the $$$ said:"$$$ notwithstanding the contention was advanced by $$$ that industry was a pervasive expression ambient enough to embrace raw materials used for the industry and so sugar industry as a topic of legislation vested in parliament exclusive power to legislate on sugar -cane supplies to sugar factories and pursuing this expansionist logic any taxation on supplies of cane to mills would be legislation on sugar industry. $$$ the purchase tax $$$ was a usurpation by the u.p. legislature breaching the dykes of $$$ read with entry of $$$ i. he expanded on the theme by urging that any legislation which affected sugar industry by taxing its raw materials was with respect to that industry. the $$$ ratio is diametrically opposed to this reasoning and a ruling which has stood the field so long has been followed by another constitution $$$ as late as in the kannan devan hills co. v. state of kerala $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 and its force of logic has our deferential assent and can not be brushed aside by a mere appeal for reconsideration. shri shanti bhushan candidly conceded that if $$$ were good law his submission was still -born. we agree. the $$$ further held that industry as a legislative topic is of large and liberal import true. but what peripherally affects can not be confused with what goes to the heart. an acquisition of land for sugar mills or of sugar mills may affect the industry but is not an action in the legislative field forbidden for the states see the kannan devan hills produce company ltd. case. sales tax on raw materials going to a factory may affect the costing process of the manufacture but is not legislation on industrial process or allied matters affect topics reserved for parliament a situation of reductio ad absurdum may be reached.emphasis supplied is ours). the effect of acceptance of the submission of mr. shanti bhushan may also denude the state of its power to legislate even in respect of sales tax on tobacco. such a contention was specifically rejected in $$$ corporation 's case. in the kannan devan hills produce v. the state of kerala and anr. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 challenge was laid to the constitutional validity of kannan devan hills resumption of lands $$$ for want of legislative competence of the state. the contention urged was that sections and of the impugned $$$ are a law with respect of entry of $$$ i of the schedule as these provisions regulate the carrying on of tea industry within the competence of the parliament by controlling the land for tea plantation. it was urged that if the effect of legislation is to control the working of the tea plantation the legislation must be regarded as legislation with respect to entry $$$ i. $$$ 's case was cited with approval. repelling the contention it was held that the state had legislative competence to legislate on entry $$$ $$$ and entry $$$ and this power can not be denied on the ground that it has some effect on industry controlled under entry $$$ i. the constitution $$$ further said that if a state $$$ otherwise valid has effect on a matter in $$$ i it does not cease to be a legislation with respect to an entry in $$$ $$$ or $$$. it said that effect is not the same thing as subject matter. the object of sections and seems to be to enable the state to acquire all lands which do not fall within the categories a and of section. these provisions are really incidental to the exercise of the power of acquisition. the state can not be denied the power to ascertain what land should be acquired by it in the public interest. in b. viswanathiah & co. and ors. v. state of karnataka and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 the challenge was to the validity of the provisions of $$$ and cocoon regulation of production supply and distribution $$$ $$$ of. the contention urged on behalf of the petitirs in that case was that any legislation in respect of silk industry can be enacted only by the parliament and the state legislature is incompetent to legislate on the matter because section of the central silk board $$$ enacted a declaration in terms of entry $$$ i. the effect of it was to remove the silk industry from the purview of the state legislature powers thus rendering the state legislature incompetent to legislate on that topic. the high $$$ repelled the challenge relying upon the decision of this $$$ in $$$ $$$ corporation ltd.harakchand ratanchand $$$ devan hills produce company 's cases. after noticing that the high $$$ on the basis of series of decisions of this $$$ regarding scope of entry of $$$ i in the schedule of the constitution had repelled the challenge this $$$ expressed full agreement with the views of the high $$$. it was held that the control of industry vested in parliament was restricted to the aspect of production and manufacture of silk yarn or silk. it did not obviously take in the earlier stage of industry namely the supply of raw materials. for instance even in regard to the silk industry the reeling production development and distribution of silkworm seeds and cocoons was regulated by the state $$$. these items can be perhaps legitimately described as raw materials of the silk industry. the control being vested in parliament under entry of silk industry did not affect the control over these raw materials. it was held that the control supply and distribution of the goods produced by the industry was the aspect of industry which falls outside the purview of the control postulated under entry. in other words though the production and manufacture of raw silk can not be legislated upon by the state legislature in view of the provisions of the central $$$ and the declaration in section thereof that declaration does not in any way limit the powers of the state legislature to legislate in respect of goods produced by the silk industry. this $$$ said that to interpret entry otherwise would render entry in $$$ of the schedule to the constitution otiose and meaningless. the same would be the position in the present case. the acceptance of the argument of mr. shanti bhushan would make various entries in the state $$$ otiose and meaningless and subject to entry of $$$ i despite the fact that the entries are not so worded. in indian aluminium company ltd. and anr. v. karnataka electricity board and ors. $$$ / sc/0$$$$/99$$$ / sc/0$$$$/99 challenging the amending $$$ by the state the contention urged before the high $$$ was that:"aluminium industry is scheduled industry under the control of the government of india as declared by industries development and regulation $$$ and hence falls under entry of $$$ i of $$$ of the constitution. therefore the policy of government of india amounts to direction issued to the state government which they are bound to obey. consequently the agreement of is an agreement protected by a law coming under entry of $$$ i terms of which can not be varied by a law enacted by a state by virtue of the power conferred by the concurrent $$$ $$$ $$$i of v$$$th schedule. the amending $$$ should be construed in such a way as not to impinge on or detract from the law statutory order or constitutional direction of the central government otherwise the said amending $$$ will lack legislative competence. the high $$$ relying upon the decision in $$$ 's case where the concept of industry as a topic of legislation was explained repelled the aforesaid contention. the decision and reasoning given by the high $$$ upholding the vires of the amending $$$ relating to the concept of industry as explained in $$$ 's case were upheld by this $$$. in shriram industrial enterprises ltd. v. the union of india and ors. $$$ / up/00/99$$$ / up/00/99 air99all a full $$$ of allahabad high $$$ examined the validity of u.p. sheera $$$ u.p. $$$ no. xxiv of on the question of the competence of the state legislature. its validity had been challenged by the sugar industry. it was urged that by virtue of section g of the idr $$$ the state legislature stood denuded of power to legislate regulating supply distribution and supplies of molasses a product of sugar industry and was consequently incompetent to enact sections and of the aforesaid state $$$. the full $$$ tracing the history of legislation leading to framing of the constitution held that if the argument about denuding of power of state legislature is accepted most of the entries in $$$s $$$ and would be meaningless. once the parliament makes a declaration under entry of $$$ i for instance entries and would be redundant. the high $$$ said that neither it was the intention of the framers of the constitution nor the said contention is born out from the perusal of entry and the other entries of $$$s $$$ and of the schedule. noticing various decisions of this $$$ the high $$$ concluded as under:"applying the principles propounded by the apex $$$ in the cases mentid above it is apparent that the state legislature is competent to make law in respect of the subject industries under entry of the $$$ $$$ subject to entries and of $$$ i of the schedule and is further competent to enact law on the subject trade and commerce within the state and production supply and distribution of goods under entry and entry of $$$ $$$ subject to entry of $$$ $$$i of schedule of the constitution. but on declaration under entry of $$$ i by parliament in respect of the industries the control of which by the union is by law held to be expedient in the public interest consequences flow.  on declaration by parliament in respect of controlled industries the power of state legislature to legislate under entry of $$$ $$$ shifts of entry of $$$ i to the extent of control provided in the $$$. the result which follows upon declaration is that the power to enact law by state legislature under entry and entry of the $$$ $$$ of schedule becomes part of entry of $$$ $$$i which is a concurrent list.  consequence that follows on declaration is that the products of the controlled industries would fell within entry of $$$.the controversy before me if examined seeing the constitutional debate history of legislation structure and design of the relevant entries and also keeping in view the basic structure of the constitution the only irresistible conclusion is that section g of the idr $$$ is referable to entry of $$$ $$$i of the schedule. since the power to enact in respect of production supply and distribution of the products of the controlled industries being a concurrent subject the u.p. legislature is competent to enact the $$$ of. the structure and scope of entry of the union $$$ and entry of the state $$$ and their inter -relationship is substantially different from the scope and structure of entry of the state $$$ and entry of the union $$$. the entry relating to of mines and minerals has in it both the industry of mines and its product minerals and therefore on a declaration both miens and minerals get embedded in entry of the union $$$. therefore it has been consistently held by this $$$ that by declaration under entry the parliament evinces an intention to occupy the whole field. in my view the full $$$ rightly held that the cases relating to miens and minerals relied upon in support of the challenge to the state legislation were of no assistance. the full $$$ decision was approved by this $$$ in siel ltd. and ors. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 air99sc0. in $$$ co. ltd. v. state of bihar and ors. $$$ / sc/0/999$$$ / sc/0/999 air999sc the constitution $$$ examined the question regarding the legality of levy of market fee under the provisions of bihar agricultural produce markets $$$ pertaining to various commodities including sugarcane sugar and molasses wheat and tea. the $$$ dealt with the transaction of purchase of sugarcane by the sugar factories functioning in the market areas falling within the jurisdiction of respective market committees constituted under the market $$$. it noticed that the market $$$ had been enacted by the bihar legislature as per the legislative power vested in it by entries and of $$$ $$$ of the schedule of the constitution. the $$$ however noticed that the market $$$ dealt with supply and distribution of the goods as well as the trade and commerce therein as it seeks to regulate the sale and purchase of agricultural produce to be carried on in the specified markets under the $$$. to that extent the $$$ said the provisions of entry of $$$ $$$i override the legislative powers of the state legislature in connection with legislations dealing with trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of goods. thus to the extent to which the market $$$ seeks to regulate the transactions of sale and purchase of sugarcane and sugar which are foodstuffs and trade and commerce therein the constitution $$$ said that it has to be held that the market $$$ being enacted under the topic of legislative powers under entries and of $$$ $$$ will be subject to any other legislation under entry of the concurrent $$$. the contention of mr. $$$ being that as admittedly the tobacco is not foodstuff and does not fall under entry of $$$ $$$i like the amendment to the constitution made in the parliament by further amendment of the constitution can if so advised place tobacco raw material of the industry -in entry of $$$ $$$i and thus confer on itself the competence to legislate in respect to tobacco need not be examined by this $$$ as being unnecessary. we may however note that the constitution $$$ after noticing various provisions of the $$$ and the $$$s came to the conclusion that the need for regulating the purchase sales storage and processing of sugarcane being an agricultural produce is completely met by the comprehensive machinery provided by the $$$ $$$ enacted by the same very legislature which enacted the general $$$ being the market $$$. in $$$ co. ltd. of the contentions urged was that under the idr $$$ in public interest union of india had taken over the control of the wheat industry as specified in the schedule to the $$$ and consequently and transaction of purchase and sale of the product of that industry can not be regulated by the state $$$. the constitution $$$ noticed that the parliament in exercise of its legislative power under entry of $$$ i of the schedule had enacted the idr $$$ and flour industry is listed as of the scheduled industries under the caption food -processing industries. the $$$ said that the production of wheat as a raw material or its sale is not covered by the said $$$ and consequently so far as wheat as agricultural produce is concerned it is outside the sweep of the idr $$$. the question still remained whether the sale of flour or any other product out of wheat can be said to be covered by the sweep of the idr $$$. it was noticed that the central government had not promulgated any statutory order under section g covering the field. the $$$ rejected the contention that mere existence of a statutory provision in the $$$ enabling the central government to issue such order would be sufficient to occupy the field contemplated by the provision. while examining the decision in hingir -rampur coal company 's case on which reliance was placed by the appellants the constitution $$$ held that it has to be kept in view that any legislation in exercise of legislative power under entry of $$$ i would enable the parliament to regulate mines and the minerals development by taking them under the control of the union in public interest. thus all aspects of the mining industry would be covered by the general sweep of such a declaration. but it was noticed that the idr $$$ was enacted under entry. it was held that the scheme of entry of the union $$$ read with entry of the state $$$ was entirely different from the scheme of entry of $$$ i read with entry of $$$ $$$ with which the $$$ was concerned in that case. on conjoint reading of these entries the ratio of the decision in hingir -rampur coal company 's case it was held can not be effectively pressed into service. as already noticed the majority decision in itc case for the view it took had placed reliance on $$$ $$$ which followed hingir -rampur coal company 's case. further in $$$ company the constitution $$$ cited with approval the decision in seil case and reiterated that merely because industry is controlled by a declaration under section of the idr $$$ enacted by entry of the union $$$ the state legislature would not be denied of its power to regulate the products of such an industry by exercise of its legislative power under the state $$$. it would be useful to extract para of $$$ company 's case as under:"however so far as the idr $$$ is concerned it is enacted under entry of the schedule which deals with industries in general. simultaneously in the state $$$ itself there is entry which deals with industries subject to the provisions of entries and of $$$ i. consequently the products of such controlled industries would necessarily not be governed by the sweep of the general legislation pertaining to such industries as per entry of the union $$$. the aforesaid constitution $$$ judgment was not concerned with any state legislation enacted under entry. on the contrary it dealt with legislation of the union parliament under entry of the union $$$ read with entry of the state $$$. the scheme of the aforesaid legislative entries is entirely different from the scheme of entry of the $$$ i read with entry of $$$ $$$ with which we are concerned. on a conjoint reading of the aforesaid entries therefore the ratio of the decision of the constitution $$$ in the aforesaid case can not be effectively pressed into service by $$$ for supporting his contention. in this contention we may usefully refer to a decision of this $$$ in siel ltd. where of us sujata v manohar j. was a member. it has rightly distinguished the ratio of the constitution $$$ decision in the case of hingir rampur coal co. ltd. and taken the view that merely because an industry is controlled by a declaration under section of the idr $$$ enacted by entry of the union $$$ the state legislature would not be denied of its powers to regulate the products of such an industry by exercise of this legislative powers under entry of the state $$$. in that case the question was whether the u.p. sheera $$$ could be said to be repugnant to the molasses control order issued by the central government under section of the idr $$$ imposing restrictions on the sale of molasses and fixing the maximum price of molasses. answering the question in the negative it was held that the term industry in entry would not take within its ambit trade and commerce or production supply and distribution of goods which are within the province of entries and of $$$ $$$. similarly entry in $$$ i which deals with industry also would not cover trade and commerce in or production supply and distribution of the products of those industries which fall under entry of $$$ i. for the industries falling in entry of $$$ i these subjects are carved out and expressly put in entry of $$$. it was also held that since the molasses control order of passed by the central government in exercise of powers conferred by section was not extended at any point of time to the state of u.p. or the state of bihar the question of repugnancy between the molasses control order and the u.p. sheera $$$ does not arise. consequently it must be held that in the absence of a statutory order promulgated under section of the idr $$$ it can not be said that the field for regulation of sale and purchase of products of the flour industry like atta maida suji bran etc. would remain outside the domain of the state legislature.emphasis supplied is. the principles aforesaid would equally apply to entries and of $$$ $$$. it may further be noticed that in para of $$$ company 's case the constitution $$$ reiterates the view expressed in $$$ 's case as also in siel 's case affirming full $$$ of the allahabad high $$$ in m / s. shriram industrial enterprises supra. in view of the above i see no compelling reason either on account of any binding precedent in the form of a earlier constitution $$$ judgment history and background of the framing of the constitution or the words used in various entries or the language of any $$$ in the constitution of india to take a view which will result in denuding the power of state legislatures to legislate not in respect of field of legislation under entry but field of legislation covered by other entries on state $$$ on making of declaration under entry of the union $$$. the constitution $$$ judgment in the case of $$$ and other decisions following it confine the field of legislation of industries to the process of manufacture or production and not to raw materials which may be integral part of industrial process or to the distribution of the product of the industry.in view of the aforesaid i conclude as under:. the state legislations and the tobacco board $$$ to the extent of sale of tobacco in market area can not co -exist. the state legislatures are competent to enact legislations providing for sale of agricultural produce of tobacco in market area and for levy and collection of market fee on that produce. the parliament is not competent to pass legislation in respect of goods enumerated in aforesaid conclusion no. while legislating in the field of legislation covered by entry of the union $$$ under which the parliament can legislate only in respect of industries namely the process of manufacture of production as held in $$$ 's case. the activity regarding sale of raw tobacco as provided in the tobacco board $$$ can not be regarded as industry. itc 's case $$$ / sc/009/$$$$$$$ / sc/009/$$$$ is not correctly decided. leave in special leave petitions granted. for the aforesaid reasons the state legislations are held to be valid pieces of legislation. the appeals and the writ petition are disposed of accordingly. parties to bear their own costs.$$$ j. i have the privilege of going through the judgments separately prepared by my esteemed colleagues brother g.b. pattanaik brother y.k. sabharwal and mrs. ruma pal j.j. in all the judgment the facts as well as the relevant provisions of the law and the decisions on the subject have been very elaborately and lucidly discussed. hence it would not be necessary to go into those matters all again. the main question however which has been considered is as to whether the case itc ltd. v. state of karnataka $$$ / sc/000/$$$$$$$ / sc/000/$$$$ supp. s.c.r. has been correctly decided or not. in the above cited case it has been held that once tobacco industry in the public interest was declared as such under entry of $$$ of v$$$th schedule of the constitution the state legislature ceased to be competent to legislate on the subject viz. tobacco industry in conflict with the laws made by the parliament namely the tobacco board $$$. the state $$$ of karnataka levying market fee on sale of tobacco in the market area was thus held to be invalid. the whole legislative field in relation to the subject of tobacco including its sale as an agricultural produce was held to have vested in the parliament. while holding so reliance was placed on the decisions of this $$$ reported in state of orissa v. m. a. $$$ & co. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 and $$$ v. state of bihar and ors. $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99. mr. justice mukherjee however took a different view holding that both $$$s namely the tobacco board $$$ and the karnataka agricultural produce market $$$ could operate together without offending each other. therefore the other question for consideration before this $$$ has been as to whether provisions of the $$$s viz. tobacco board $$$ and state $$$ could operate together or not. different states namely bihar u.p.$$$ and others have similar state legislations levying market fee on sale of agricultural produce including tobacco. the same question arose for consideration in respect of these states as well in way or the other. brother pattanaik in his judgment has found that the itc case supra has been correctly decided though reasons for holding so were slightly different than the reasons on the basis of which the judgment was rendered in the itc case. it has been further held that once parliament takes over the control of a particular industry in the interest of the said industry as well as in the national interest the control should be effective and should be in such a manner that the desired object can be achieved. therefore whole legislative field was open to the parliament to legislate on the subject of tobacco industry including growing of tobacco as well as its sale and purchase. it has also been held that in any case entrenching into the legislative field of an entry in the other list on a matter which may be ancillary or incidental thereto would not invalidate the legislation. on the other question it has been found that the $$$s namely tobacco board $$$ and the state agricultural produce marketing $$$ can not operate simultaneously. brother sabharwal j.has broadly held that the decision in $$$ju v. state of up $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 holds good for the purposes of meaning to be assigned to the expression industry occurring in entry of $$$ i. the pre manufacture activity relating to growing and sale of tobacco can not be subject matter of legislation by the parliament by virtue of declaration of tobacco industry under entry of $$$ i of the v$$$th schedule. the power of state legislation to legislate on the subject in the $$$ $$$ of the v$$$th schedule e.g. entry etc. remains unaffected. it has also been held that the state $$$ and the central $$$ can not operate simultaneously whereas hon'ble ruma pal j. has also found that power of the state legislature to make laws relating to tobacco as agricultural produce its sale and levy of market fee was not affected since it can not be said to be covered by the expression industry in entry of $$$ -i of the v$$$th schedule. the i.t.c case supra has been held to be wrongly decided. it has however been held that the tobacco board $$$ and the state $$$ can simultaneously operate without offending each other. in case it may not be possible the provisions of markets $$$ and not the tobacco $$$ would prevail. as noticed earlier the majority view in the itc case supra has been upheld in the judgment of brother pattanaik on slightly different reasoning and the decisions of this $$$ in m.a. $$$ and $$$ supra dealing with legislation on mining and relied upon in the majority judgment of itc case supra have been found to be not relevant for the decision. it is true while legislating on any subject covered under an entry of any list there can always be a possibility of entrenching upon or touching the field of legislation of another entry of the same $$$ or another $$$ for matters which may be incidental or ancillary thereto. in such eventually inter alia broad and liberal interpretation of an entry in the list may certainly be required. an obsolete or watertight compartmentalization of heads of subject for legislation may not be possible but at the same time entrenching into the field of another entry can not mean its total sweeping off even though it may be in the exclusive $$$ of heads of subjects for legislation by the other legislature. as in the present case the relevant heads of subject in $$$ other than entry can not be made to practically disappear from $$$ and assumed to have crossed over in totality to $$$ i by virtue of declaration of tobacco industry under entry of $$$ i in the guise of touching or entrenching upon the subjects of the list $$$. i therefore append my full agreement with the conclusions and judgment of brother sabharwal j. on all points.the courtin keeping with the conclusions of the majority expressed in the judgments of sabharwal ruma pal and $$$ $$$.it is held that:( itc 's case supp. scc was not correctly decided.the state legislatures are competent to enact legislation providing for the levy and collection of a market fee on the sale of tobacco in a market area. consequently the market $$$s enacted by the states are valid.the state legislations and the tobacco board $$$ to the extent that they relate to the sale of tobacco in market areas can not co -exist and the former prevail over the latter.the appeals and the writ petition are disposed of accordingly. no order as to costs.g.b. pattanaik j. leave granted in all the special leave petitions. i.t.c. limited filed a writ petition under $$$ and of the constitution of india before the patna high $$$ against an order of assessment passed by the agricultural produce market committee monghyr demanding a sum of rs. inter alia on the ground that the purchase of unprocessed tobacco leaves from the growers being the subject matter of the levy the market committee has no power to levy and collect fee. the stand taken before the high $$$ was that tobacco leaves neither having been bought or sold within the market area and the power to levy and collect market fee under section of the bihar agricultural produce markets $$$ being on the agricultural produce bought or sold in the market area the market committee was not entitled to levy market fee. the division $$$ however without entering into the aforesaid controversy came to the conclusion that no clear notice appears to have been given to the company to produce the records for the purpose of satisfying the market committee that the tobacco leaves in question were either not processed or exported from the market area and therefore the company must be given afresh opportunity of adducing all the relevant documents before the market committee to escape the presumption arising out of proviso to section of the $$$. the high $$$ having remitted the matter to the market committee for passing a fresh assessment order the company has approached this $$$ which is the subject matter in civil appeal no. of arising out of slp civil no. when the special leave petition was listed before a $$$ of this $$$ in $$$$ the judgment of this $$$ in i.t.c. ltd. etc. v. state of karnataka reported in $$$ / sc/000/$$$$$$$ / sc/000/$$$$ supp. s.c.r. had been placed. the $$$ tentatively being of the view that the decision of this $$$ requires reconsideration directed that the matter be placed before a constitution $$$ of judges and that is how the matter has been placed before the constitution $$$. subsequent to the bihar case similar cases arising out of judgment of other high $$$s on being assailed before this $$$ those cases also have been tagged on to this case. when this batch of cases had been earlier listed before a constitution $$$ and arguments had been advanced on behalf of company the $$$ felt that it would be appropriate to issue notice to the attorney general and the advocate generals of all the states as most of the states have their state $$$ called the agricultural produce market $$$ and pursuant to the order of this $$$ dated 0th of april notices were issued to advocate generals of all the states as well as to the ld. attorney general whereafter this case has been heard by this $$$. different state legislatures have enacted agricultural produce and markets $$$ for regulating sale and purchase of the agricultural produce within the market area and for levy and collection of market -fee. parliament having declared that it is expedient in the public interest that union should take under its control the tobacco industry enacted the tobacco board $$$ which is an $$$ to provide for the development of tobacco industry under the control of the union government. under the agricultural produce markets $$$ the state government having notified tobacco as an agricultural produce the purchase and sale of tobacco is to be regulated under the provisions of the state $$$ and the market committee has the right to levy and collect market -fee on such sale and purchase of the notified agricultural produce viz. the tobacco. in a case arising from the state of karnataka this $$$ by a majority of came to hold that the tobacco industry having been taken over by the central government under entry of $$$ i and having passed the tobacco board $$$ the state legislature ceases to have any jurisdiction to legislate in that field and therefore the provisions contained in the karnataka $$$ entitling the market committee to levy market -fee in respect of sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area directly collides with the tobacco board $$$ and as such the state $$$ so far as it relates to tobacco was struck down. the minority view expressed by justice mukherjee was however to the effect that both $$$s can operate in their respective fields and there is no repugnancy if both the $$$s are considered in the light of their respective true nature and character. the majority view relied upon the decisions of this $$$ in state of orissa v. m.a. $$$ and co. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 and baij nath kedia v. state of bihar and ors. $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99. the other matter arising out of the judgment of patna high $$$ is filed by agricultural produce market committee against a similar order as in civil appeal no. of remanding the matter for making a fresh assessment order after issuing notice to the itc. so far as civil appeals arising out of the judgment of allahabad high $$$ is concerned the division $$$ of allahabad high $$$ followed the judgment of this $$$ in itc v. the state of karnataka supp l. scc and held that $$$ can not charge a market fee on sale and purchase of tobacco and consequently krishi utpadan $$$ has preferred the appeals in question. civil appeal no. of also arises out of a judgment of allahabad high $$$ and the tobacco merchants ' association and ors.are the appellants. the full $$$ of allahabad high $$$ considered the constitutional validity of u.p. krishi utpadan $$$ and came to hold that the $$$ permitting levy and collection of fee under section in so far as it applies to tobacco is not repugnant to the provisions of tobacco board $$$ and further held that the decision of the supreme $$$ in ram chander $$$ v. state of u.p. is binding notwithstanding the subsequent decision of the supreme $$$ in the case of itc v. state of karnataka supra and therefore the tobacco merchants ' association has assailed the legality of the aforesaid full $$$ decision. so far as the state of $$$ is concerned the $$$ agricultural marketing board has assailed the judgment of the division $$$ of the high $$$ as the high $$$ followed the judgment of this $$$ in the itc case and held that the state legislature has no legislative power or competence to notify tobacco for the purpose of control and regulation and levy market fee under the provisions of $$$ regulation $$$. in fact the high $$$ held that the ratio of majority opinion in itc case squarely applies and therefore the state legislature of $$$ has no legislative power to notify or provide for notifying tobacco for the purpose of control regulation and levy of fee or other charges under the provisions of $$$ agricultural produce markets $$$. jayalakshmi tobacco company filed a civil writ petition no. of under $$$ challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation $$$ on the ground that in view of tobacco board $$$ and tobacco association $$$ the entire field regarding the development to tobacco industry including the marketing of tobacco was occupied and the state legislation is repugnant to the central $$$. so far as appeals arising out of the judgments of madhya pradesh high $$$ are concerned the high $$$ of madhya pradesh followed the judgment of this $$$ in the itc case and held that the market committee will not be entitled to realise any market fee in relation to the trade with regard to tobacco since the market committee $$$ is repugnant to the tobacco board $$$. it may be stated that though the writ petition had been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the state $$$ the high $$$ held the m.p. krishi utpadan $$$ as amended by m.p. krishi utpadan $$$ to be valid. mr. shanti bhushan learned senior counsel appeared for itc and argued that the majority view in the decision of itc case is correct and once parliament has made a law relating to tobacco industry which provides for the manner and place of sale as well as levy of fee on the sale the market committee $$$ enacted by the state legislature providing levy of fee for sale of the tobacco within the market area will be repugnant to the central law and therefore the state $$$ so far as it deals with tobacco must be held to be ultra vires. mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for the state of bihar on the other hand contended that the majority decision in the case must be held to the contrary to several constitutional $$$ decisions of this $$$ starting from $$$ v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 and the word industry in entry of $$$ i must be given a limited meaning. so construed according to mr. dwividi the parliament can not be said to have legislative competence to make law in relation to growing of raw tobacco or even sale thereof and to that extent the tobacco board $$$ must be held to be invalid. according to him the state legislature was fully competent to enact the agricultural market committee $$$ and providing therein for levy of fee for sale and purchase of agricultural produce including tobacco. apart from the main arguments advanced by these learned senior counsel several other counsel appearing for market committee namely mr. $$$ appearing in $$$ case dr. a.m. $$$ appearing for market committee monghyr mrs. $$$ appearing for $$$ of farukhabad mr. pramod swarup appearing in the case arising out of the judgment of allahabad high $$$ mr. g.l. $$$ appearing for $$$ in the madhya pradesh batch of appeals supported the arguments advanced by mr. $$$. mr. g.l. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for madhya pradesh $$$ in m.p. batch of appeals submitted for re -conciliation of both the $$$s and contended that there exists no repugnancy and both $$$s can be allowed to operate. mr. $$$ the learned additional solicitor general appearing for the attorney general of india however contended that the constitutionality of tobacco $$$ not having been assailed in any of these cases the $$$ need not embark upon an enquiry with regard to the competence of parliament to enact the tobacco board $$$ under entry $$$ i of the v$$$th schedule. he also further contended that the tobacco industry having been notified as an industry the control of which the parliament thought it expedient to be taken over in the public interest and the tobacco board $$$ having been enacted there can not be any limitation for exercise of power of the parliament even in relation to the growing of tobacco or sale of tobacco at specified place as well as levy of fee for such sale and in that view of the matter the market committee $$$ providing levy of market fee on sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area must be struck down. it is true as contended by the learned additional solicitor general that constitutional validity of the tobacco board $$$ had not been assailed in any of these cases and only in this $$$ mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for the state of bihar raised the contention in view of the judgment of this $$$ in itc case. ordinarily this $$$ does not embark upon an enquiry on the constitutionality of the legislation if that had not been assailed. but taking into account the procedure that had already been adopted and noticing all the advocate generals and the attorney general in view of the amplitude of arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties we do not think it appropriate to dispose of this batch of cases without examining the constitutional validity of the tobacco board $$$ enacted by the parliament under entry of $$$ i. in fact the main thrust of the rival contention centers round the same. mr. shanti bhushan learned senior counsel appearing for the itc ltd. $$$ that entry of $$$ i of the v$$$th schedule of the constitution requires the parliament to make a declaration by law identifying an industry the control of which is expedient to be taken over by the union in the public interest. once such a declaration is made by the parliament the entire gamut would be within the legislative competence of parliament to make law and the very industry having been made the subject of legislation the parliament gets exclusive power under $$$ of the constitution. $$$ itself being notwithstanding anything in clauses and of such $$$ once parliament makes a law in relation to control of an industry in respect of which a declaration has been made the state legislature will be denuded of its power to make any law in respect of that industry. mr. shanti bhushan contends that every entry in the legislative $$$ has to be construed in its widest sense as was held by this $$$ in harakchand $$$ and ors. etc. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 and even privy council has also laid down the said proposition. there is therefore no rational to give restrictive meaning to the expression industry in entry of $$$ i of the v$$$th schedule. the learned counsel placed reliance on the meaning of the word industry contained in encyclopedia of britannica which indeed is too wide and submitted the $$$ can not and ought not give a restricted meaning to the expression so as to denude the legislative authority to make law on the subject. the learned counsel made a reference to laws made by the parliament on a declaration being made in terms of entry of $$$ i namely the cardomon $$$ the central silk board $$$ the coffee $$$ the rubber $$$ the tea $$$ the coir industry $$$ the coconut development board $$$ and the tobacco board $$$. the learned counsel urged that the industries development & regulation $$$ had declared only certain manufacturing industries but that by itself will not denude the parliament of its legislative competence to make law over any industry once a declaration in terms of entry of $$$ i is made vesting the entire control over the industry with the union government. according to mr. shanti bhushan the constitution $$$ decision in harakchand 's case $$$ / $$$ / sc/00/99 fully answers this question. the learned counsel contends that the entries in the lists are only the heads of fields of legislation demarcating the area over which the appropriate legislature can operate. the legislative entries must be given a large and liberal interpretation reason being that the allocation of subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but is a mere enumeration of broad and comprehensive categories. according to mr. shanti bhushan in the constitution $$$ decision of this $$$ in harakchand supra while construing the expression industry in entry of $$$ i the wider definition of the industry in the $$$ 's $$$ has been approved and therefore there is no justification in giving the expression any restrictive meaning. the learned counsel also urged that in the very same case construing entry of $$$ the $$$ observed that the entry industry is a special entry while entry dealing with production supply and distribution of goods is a general entry. mr. shanti bhushan contends that the word industry if has been held to be a special entry whether in entry of the $$$ or entry and entry of $$$ i law made under that entry must prevail over any law which could be referable to a general entry. according to mr. shanti bhushan applying the ratio in harakchand supra it must be held that the majority view in the itc case is correct. mr. shanti bhushan further urged a particular industry in respect of which a declaration is made by the parliament in terms of entry of $$$ i the industry itself having become a subject of $$$ legislation any provision contained therein which have a reasonable nexus would be within the legislative competence of the parliament under $$$ of the constitution and would be valid. according to the learned counsel a law dealing with the raw -material of a declared industry can not be held to be having no nexus with the industry itself and if the parliament would be denuded of this power to make law dealing with raw -material of the declared industry then the very purpose of making a declaration and taking over the control of the industry in the interest of the public would be frustrated. if the parliament does not choose to cover all aspects of that industry and may confine the regulation of that industry only with regard to the manufacturing part as was d in the industries development & regulation $$$ then certainly there would be no repugnancy even if the state legislature makes a law dealing with the raw materials of the notified industry provided the state law is referable to any of the entries in $$$. so far as the observations made by the constitution $$$ in tikaramji 's case supra mr. shanti bhushan contends that the articles relatable to the scheduled industry were finished products and not raw materials and therefore sic at all purport to cover or have any provisions therein relating to sugarcane. it was in this context the observations came to be made by this $$$ in tikaramji 's case supra that the expression industry will have a limited meaning. mr. shanti bhushan also placed reliance on the constitution $$$ decision in $$$. $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 which dealt with the legislative competence under the government of india $$$. the $$$ was in that case examining the question whether the central excise $$$ was beyond the legislative competence under the government of india $$$. on examining entry of the union $$$ and entries and of the state $$$ the $$$ held that the examination should be as to whether the $$$ in question is a law with respect to matters enumerated in item of $$$ i or to the matters enumerated in items and of $$$. quoting the observations of federal $$$ to the effect;"it must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation though purporting to deal with a subject in list touches also on a subject in another list and the different provisions of the enactment may be so closely intertwined that blind adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation would result in a large number of statutes being declared invalid because the legislature enacting them may appear to have legislated in a forbidden sphere". approved the same and held that it was a correct method of interpreting the various items in different lists. mr. shanti bhushan also pointed out that in the aforesaid judgment the constitution $$$ followed the earlier observations of $$$ j. in the case of state of rajasthan v. g. chawla $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 to the effect;"it is equally well settled that the power to legislate on a topic of legislation carries with it the power to legislate on an ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included in the power given. according to the learned counsel it would be within the competence of the central legislature to provide for matters which may otherwise fall within the competence of the state legislature if the are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the central legislation on a subject of legislation expressly within its power. according to mr. shanti bhushan if the expression industry is construed in the wide sense in which it was construed by this $$$ in the constitution $$$ judgment of harakchand supra then the provisions of tobacco board $$$ of would certainly be within the legislative competence of parliament notwithstanding the fact that some of those provisions may touch upon subjects contained in the state $$$s. the learned counsel in this connection also placed reliance on a recent decision of this $$$ in the case of state bank of india v. $$$ rao $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$. with reference to the decisions of this $$$ in $$$ gas $$$ / $$$ / sc/00/9 the $$$ $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99 and tikaramji supra the learned counsel contended that in n of these cases the competence of parliament to make any law was under consideration. on the other hand both in $$$ gas supra case and in $$$ supra case what was under consideration is as between the entries if is general and the other is special then which law would prevail and the $$$ held that the special law would prevail over the general law. in $$$ gas case the word industry in entry was held to be a general entry whereas word gas and gas works in entry was held to be special entry and applying the principle of harmonious interpretation the $$$ held that the expression industry sic given a limited scope so as to exclude from its ambit sic and gas works and it is in this sense it was held that from the expression industry in entry in $$$ the gas and gas works must be excluded. in $$$ 's case supra also the $$$ applied the same principle of special excluding general and held that the production and manufacturing of liquor would not fall under entry of $$$ but under entry of the $$$ which relates to intoxicating liquor that is to say that the production manufacture possession transport purchase and sale intoxicating liquors. according to the learned counsel these decisions will have no relevance in the context of the present case where the competence of the parliament to make any law within the ambit of entry of $$$ i is the subject matter of scrutiny. mr. shanti bhushan also urged that entry of the state $$$ relating to production supply and distribution of goods can not be held to be a special entry so as to be excluded from the purview of entry of $$$ i. according to him the entries do not form the part of the same genus so as to apply in the same field and if the ratio in the judgment in harakchand supra case is applied then entry can not be held to be a special entry. he also relied upon the constitution $$$ judgment in waverly jute mills case $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 where the $$$ was required to examine the competence of the parliament to enact forward contract regulation $$$ and whether it encroached upon the subject matter falling under entry and entry of $$$. the $$$ upheld the validity of the law by holding that the parliament has legislative competence under entry of $$$ i relating to stock exchanges and future markets and in fact it has the exclusive competence. mr. shanti bhushan contended that apart from the fact that in tikaramji supra in $$$ gas supra $$$ supra the competence of the parliament to make law had not been assailed and on the other hand what was under consideration is whether the central $$$ and the state $$$ could be held to cover different fields so that there was no repugnancy between the. it was further contended that the state $$$s would be ultra vires as they related to subject which were brought to the union $$$ by a declaration in terms of entry. mr. shanti bhushan contends that all the decisions in which constitutional validity of $$$ enactment was questid on the ground of ambit of entry of $$$ i the $$$ has upheld the validity of the same as in harakchand supra. any incidental observation where the competence of parliament to make law was not under assail can not be relied upon for the proposition that the expression industry in entry of $$$ i must have a restricted meaning. with special reference to tikaramji 's case supra the learned counsel contended that the $$$ was not examining the scope of word industry as contained in entry of $$$ i as is apparent from the discussions at page of the scr but was examining the question whether raw -materials of an industry which from an integral part of the process are within the topic of industry which forms the subject -matter of item of $$$ i as ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly or reasonably be said to be comprehended in that topic and whether the central legislature while legislating upon sugarcane industry could act within the scope of entry of $$$ i and would as well legislate upon sugarcane. the observations of the learned judge at page of the report according to mr. shanti bhushan are only in that context and when the $$$ did not go into the question as to whether the word industry could or could not have a wide meaning which could be applied when parliament purported to cover other aspects apart from the manufacturing processes it would not be appropriate to hold that the word industry in entry of list i must be given a restricted meaning. according to the learned counsel in tikaramjis supra the $$$ was considering the question of repugnancy and it answered by comparing the provisions of industries development and regulation $$$ with the provisions of up regulation of $$$ $$$ and found that there was no repugnancy and were covering different fields and could therefore co -exist. it is urged that a restricted meaning being give to the expression industry in entry and of $$$ i or entry of $$$ i will have disastrous consequences inasmuch as the parliament would declare by law a particular industry to be necessary for the purposes of defence or for the prosecution of war under entry and yet in such law can not make any provision in respect of raw -materials or growth of any item which may be absolutely necessary for the industry in question. according to mr. shanti bhushan the learned senior counsel the majority judgment in itc case no doubt relied upon the decisions of this $$$ in state of orissa v. m.s. $$$ -$$$ / $$$ / sc/00/9 and $$$ kedia v. state of bihar -$$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99 for the proposition that when the central government takes over an industry under entry of $$$ i and passes an $$$ to regulate the legislation the state legislature ceases to have the jurisdiction to legislate in that field and if it does so then it would be ultra vires of the powers of the state legislature as the entire field is occupied by the central legislation. the case of $$$ supra as well as the case of $$$ supra deal with the laws made by the parliament under entry of $$$ i of the v$$$th schedule and the $$$ was examining those laws and the legislative competence vis -a -vis entry of $$$ but those principles laid down in $$$ 's case supra as well as in $$$ 's case supra would equally apply to the legislation made under entry of $$$ i as has been held by this $$$ in paragraph of ishwari khetan sugar mills v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/009/90$$$ / sc/009/90 judgment. the learned counsel stated that what has been stated therein that on a law being made by the parliament in respect of a particular industry the state 's legislative power would stand denuded only to the extent that any aspect related to that industry is actually covered by the $$$ legislation. in other words it is necessary to examine the extent of coverage by the parliament enactment as has been held in $$$ and the extreme argument advanced in the case that the industry as a subject by itself goes out of the competence of the state legislature was not accepted. according to mr. shanti bhushan it is a well settled principle once a parliamentary legislation is enacted whether in exercise of its competence under entry in $$$ i or $$$ or there is an incidental or ancillary coverage over some entries in the state $$$ and there is any repugnancy between the law made by the parliament and law made by the state legislature then it is only the parliamentary law to the extent of repugnancy which has to prevail and not the state legislation. on the question of the re -conciliation between the tobacco board $$$ and the agricultural market committee $$$ and in relation to the provisions contained in section of the tobacco board $$$ to the effect -provisions of this $$$ shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force the learned counsel contends the aforesaid provision by no stretch of imagination can be construed to mean that notwithstanding the state legislation being repugnant to the parliamentary law yet the state legislation will be permitted to operate. according to the learned counsel section of the tobacco board $$$ purports to declare that if a law which was consistent with the tobacco board $$$ and made additional requirement of some kind laid down under any other $$$ it should not be taken as if in respect of any matter relating to tobacco all other acts whether consistent or inconsistent with the tobacco $$$ will cease to prevail. in other words if there is any field which is not covered by the tobacco board $$$ and if there was some other valid provision then the tobacco board $$$ would not come in the way. in support of this contention mr. shanti bhushan relied upon the decision in m. $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/09/99$$$ / sc/09/99 wherein in paragraph this $$$ in unequivocal terms expressed the intention that the state $$$ which was undoubtedly the dominant legislation would only be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force which manifestly includes the central $$$s namely the indian penal code the corruption $$$ and the criminal law amendment $$$. in analysing the provisions of the tobacco board $$$ the counsel contends that the intention of the parliament is to cover the field of trade in tobacco. relying upon the constitution $$$ decision in $$$ company $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ air$$$$sc air$$$$sc the learned counsel contends that if a special $$$ deals with regulating trade in an $$$ it has to go out of the sweep of the agricultural markets $$$. in this view of the matter the tobacco board $$$ having been a special $$$ regulating the sale and purchase of the agricultural produce namely tobacco and the marketing $$$ being of a general nature the marketing $$$ will cease to operate in respect of tobacco. analysing different provisions of the tobacco board $$$ and the bihar agricultural produce marketing $$$ the counsel urged that the provisions can not co -exist and therefore the majority view in itc case rightly held that the agricultural market committee $$$ framed by the state legislature is ultra vires. mr. nageshwar rao learned senior counsel appearing for the tobacco merchants ' association reiterated all that had been argued by mr. shanti bhushan and placing reliance upon several authorities submitted that the tobacco board $$$ being a special $$$ enacted by parliament for controlling the tobacco industry and making provision therein relating to growing of tobacco and purchase or sale of tobacco which have direct nexus with the tobacco industry the general provisions of the agricultural produce market $$$ will have to give way to the tobacco board $$$ and therefore the market committee would have no power to levy market fee by taking recourse to the provisions of the market committee $$$ on the purchase and sale of tobacco within a market area. mr. $$$ learned senior counsel who led the main argument by contending that the parliament had no competence to make the tobacco board $$$ in its entirety particularly in relation to growing and raw -materials of the tobacco industry appearing for the state of bihar contended that the subject matter industry in entry of $$$ of the v$$$th schedule can not be construed to be all pervasive and the constitution $$$ of this $$$ in tikaramji supra conclusively held that the raw -materials which are integral part of the industrial process can not be included in the process of manufacture or production. according to mr. $$$ the $$$ should construe a particular entry in the schedule in a manner so that the other entries in the schedule will not be otiose. consequently the raw -materials would be goods which would comprised in entry of $$$ and the manufacturing process or production would come within the ambit of expression industry in entry of $$$. entry of $$$ being subject to entry of $$$ i when parliament makes a law in respect of an industry in exercise of its power referable to entry of $$$ i then that expression can not be wider than the word industry in entry of $$$. it would therefore be given a restricted meaning to the expression industry as was d by this $$$ in tikaramji 's case which was followed in $$$ gas kannan devan hills and $$$ corporation. according to mr. $$$ even in the case of b. viswanathaiah & co. v. state of karnataka $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 a judge $$$ of this $$$ construed the declaration made in terms of entry of $$$ i in relation to silk industry and held that taking over the control of raw silk industry must be restricted to the aspect of production and manufacture of silk yarn or silk and did not take in the earlier stages of the industry namely the supply of raw -materials. according to mr. $$$ in the aforesaid case the $$$ unequivocally held that the declaration in section which is under entry of $$$ i do not in any way limit the powers of the state legislature to legislate in respect of goods produced by the silk industry. the $$$ so held being of the opinion that any wider interpretation to the expression industry in entry of $$$ would render entry in $$$ to be otiose and meaningless. mr. $$$ also further contended that both in indian aluminium company $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99 as well s siel ltd. and ors. v. union of indian and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 air99sc0 tikaramji and $$$ gas have been followed and it has been held that the term industry in entry of $$$ and entry of $$$ could have the same meaning and it would not take within its ambit trade and commerce or production supply and distribution of goods coming within the province of entry and of $$$. referring to the constitution bench decision of this $$$ in $$$ mills $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ air$$$$sc air$$$$sc mr. $$$ submits that in the aforesaid case the $$$ was construing the provisions in entry of $$$ as well as entry of $$$i and sugar and sugar cane having been held as food stuff coming within the ambit of entry of $$$i the market committee $$$ referable to entries and of $$$ was held to be subject to the sugar cane $$$. thus industry in entry of $$$ and entry of $$$ i would not cover the subject matter coming within the ambit of entries and of $$$ or entry of $$$. it is therefore urged that the raw tobacco which would be a produce of agriculture and thus the raw -material for the tobacco industry which required to be cured and processed and for such a raw -material for the tobacco industry the parliament can not make any legislation by making a declaration and taking over the control of tobacco industry under entry of $$$ i. tobacco not being a food stuff the same will also not come within the ambit of entry of $$$i and therefore the raw -tobacco would continue to be within the exclusive domain of the state legislature and state legislature would have power to make law in relation to the raw -tobacco which would be referable to entry agriculture entries and of $$$ as has been held by this court in the constitution bench decision in the case of $$$ supra. mr. $$$ contends that judged from this angle to the extent the tobacco board $$$ seeks to regulate the market by providing for auction platform and by seeking to regulate growing of raw -tobacco must be held to be beyond the competence of parliament and on the other hand is within the exclusive domain of the state legislature. state legislature having provided for a market where al the trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of tobacco can take place the tobacco board $$$ would cease to operate and it is the state law which would prevail. with reference to the judgments in m.a. $$$ and baij nath kedia relied upon in the majority judgment of itc 's case mr. $$$ contends that those decisions will have no application inasmuch as a comparison of entry of $$$ and entry of $$$ i would indicate that the head of the legislation is and the same and entry of $$$ itself is subject to entry of $$$ i. necessarily therefore the entire field which was there available for the state legislature to make law under entry of $$$ once assumed by the parliament under entry of $$$ i then the state legislature is denuded of its power. question of giving narrow meaning or wider meaning to the legislative entry does not arise for consideration in those cases. accordingly the majority judgment of this court committed error in construing the meaning to be given to the word industry under entry of $$$ i by relying upon the decision under mining legislation which was wholly unwarranted. mr. $$$ urged that even the tobacco board $$$ has not been made operative in the state of bihar and several other states for instance section and. this being the position in the states where aforesaid provision had not been brought into force there can not be any difficulty in allowing the state $$$ namely the agricultural market committee $$$ to operate. with reference to legislative history for the expression industry in entry of $$$ i mr. $$$ contends that the fact that a separate entry was made for regulating trade and commerce production supply and distribution of the products of controlled industry would suggest that the expression industry in entry of $$$ i will have a restricted meaning. mr. $$$ urged that if the contention of the appellant that the word industry in entry of $$$ i should be given a wider interpretation is correct then the same would be destructive of the scheme pertaining to distribution of powers. mr. $$$ refers to the judgment of this court in tikaramji as well as the judgment of full bench of allahabad high court in siel case and points out as to how the law relating to trade and commerce and production supply and distribution of goods has been traced in these cases and how after the end of the world war when emergency was lifted the power to enact on the subject was given to the central legislature by india central government & legislature $$$. mr. $$$ urged even through under government of india $$$ the subject of trade commerce production supply and distribution of goods was within the competence of the provincial legislature the law was made temporarily by the central legislature. under the constitution of india $$$ was included which empowers the parliament to make laws for years with respect to trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of certain specified products. that very $$$ shows that the subject matters of raw -cotton raw -jute cotton seed etc. would be covered by the entries in $$$ and even the marginal note of $$$ throws sufficient light on the subject. by referring to $$$s and the learned counsel urged that they are special provisions which provide that in the national interest during proclamation of emergency with the consent of or more states parliament can make law with respect of any of the matters coming within the state $$$. in fact in the constituent assembly there was a heated debate in relation to $$$ and there was a strong objection to wide power being given by that $$$ for legislation in the national interest with respect to the state $$$. the founding fathers apprehended that in the name of national interest the federal character of the indian polity could be completely destroyed and india could be converted into unitary state therefore $$$ was re -tailored and was provided for a shorter duration of operation of parliamentary law so made. mr. $$$ urged that the term industry in entry of $$$ i as well as entry of $$$ i should be confined to the process of manufacture of the industries which are declared to be necessary for the purpose of defence or for prosecution of war. according to mr. $$$ there is no necessity or compulsion to give this entry a wider meaning merely because the war situation is being dealt with in the state entry. in such a situation entry of $$$i is always available to parliament for controlling products and $$$ gives over riding power to the parliament to legislate with respect to any matter enumerated in the state $$$ during the period of proclamation of emergency. even $$$s to also confer sufficient power on the president to declare by proclamation that a grave emergency exists which can be kept alive as long as the war situation or need of defence is required. by virtue of $$$ the power of parliament would extend to making of laws with respect to a matter not enumerated in the union $$$ therefore the constitution makers have well thought of and designed the constitution in such a manner in the matter of distribution of power that there would be no difficulty at all for the parliament to enact any law when the country is in war and therefore in normal times there should be no justification to give the expression industry a wider meaning and thereby denuding the state legislatures to make law on several heads of legislation enumerated in $$$. according to mr. $$$ reference to entry of $$$ i in this context was wholly mis -conceived as that is a specific entry in $$$ i with regard to arms and as such would not be covered under entry of $$$ and entry of $$$. mr. $$$ also contended that reference to $$$ in this context is mis -conceived as the said $$$ can be invoked both by the parliament and the state legislatures to make law with respect to of the matters enumerated in the concurrent $$$. the expression repugnant in article refers to matter only in the concurrent $$$ and it is in this connection he placed reliance on the decision of this court in the case deep chand suppl. scr and hoechst chemicals $$$ / sc/09/9$$$ / sc/09/9. according to mr. $$$ federalism having been accepted as of the basic features of our constitution as was held by this court in s.r. $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99 a construction of a particular legislative entry which would denude another legislative body from exercising its power in respect of several heads of legislation could be held to be contrary to the basic feature of the constitution and therefore the court should avoid giving a wider meaning to the expression industry entry and entry of $$$ i as well as entry of $$$. with reference to different articles of the constitution mr. $$$ contends that the state legislatures have exclusive power to make laws with respect to entries in the state $$$ and only in specified contingencies parliament can legislate with respect to them. in this view of the matter counsel contends entries in $$$ i ought not to be construed very widely as construed by this court in itc case. the counsel says that in the state of bihar market $$$ in relation to tobacco is relatable to entries and of $$$ whereas tobacco board $$$ enacted by the parliament includes within its fold the entire process of growing curing and marketing of tobacco and unlike the sugar industry and purchase of sugar cane by it which was dealt with by the constitution bench in the case of $$$ ji the tobacco industry can not be split up with reference to the raw -material. according to learned counsel growing of tobacco its curing and marketing being integrated industrial process the same would be embedded into tobacco industry. the very object of the tobacco board $$$ being to encourage export of good quality tobacco and to augment the foreign exchange reserves the same does not seek to regulate and control the sale and purchase of tobacco in normal markets in different states. therefore trade and commerce production supply and distribution of tobacco in different markets in india could not be regulated by the tobacco board $$$. he also urged that the $$$ in question may not be solely to the field of legislation in entry of $$$ i inasmuch as foreign exchange comes within entry of $$$ i whereas law ensuring fair and remunerative prices for the growers and minimum prices for export of tobacco could be referable to entry of $$$. this being the position it is not possible to define the industry in its widest form. further the tobacco board $$$ being an $$$ to regulate the sale of tobacco at auction platform the raw -material which is produced by the growers in so far as the growing of raw -material is concerned the same would be the matter pertaining to exclusive domain of agriculture covered by entry of $$$ and the parliament can not be permitted to encroach upon the domain of the state legislature. the learned counsel places reliance on the decision of this court in a.s. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9. mr. $$$ does not agree with the submission of the counsel appearing for the company that the tobacco industry in comprehensive integrated industry covering within its expanse the growing of tobacco curing marketing and export. according to him growing of tobacco is pure and simple agriculture and the industrial aspect beings after the industries purchase raw tobacco from the growers and begin curing the same. consequently the market $$$s enacted by the state legislature would be fully competent legal and valid governing the sale and purchase of tobacco within the local market area. referring to the provisions of the bihar $$$ the counsel urged that the same had been enacted by the state legislature under entry of $$$ the object being to provide for better regulation of buying and selling of agricultural product and the establishment of markets for agricultural produce. the comparison of the provisions of the market $$$ and the tobacco board $$$ would show that both the $$$s can operate particularly when the tobacco board has not set up any auction platform or any kind of market center in bihar and in fact several relevant provisions like section and have not been enforced in the state of bihar. if the provision of the tobacco board $$$ is construed in its wide meaning then the parliament must be held to have no competence to make laws in respect of anything prior to the curing of tobacco. according to the learned counsel when this court in itc case held the state $$$ to be invalid it so held on the conclusion that the entire field is covered by the central legislation. but no steps having been taken by the tobacco board in the state of bihar under section and and other provisions not having been applied it is difficult to subscribe that the entire field is covered by the tobacco $$$. mr. $$$ also very seriously contended that the parliament by enacting the law under entry of $$$ i in relation to the tobacco industry and having enacted tobacco board $$$ included the provisions of section which unequivocally indicates that the $$$ is in addition and not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force. this being the position the market $$$ must be allowed to operate. therefore the market committee would be entitled to levy market fee on the sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area. reliance was placed on the decisions of this court in m. $$$ / sc/09/99$$$ / sc/09/99 $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 and $$$ / $$$ / sc/009/90. with special reference to the majority judgment of this court in itc 's case the counsel urged that the aforesaid decision has not noticed several decisions of this court starting from tikaramji $$$ gas. mr. $$$ also contended that as has been held by this court in several decisions in the event of any conflict between the law made by the parliament with reference to some entry in $$$ i and the law made by the state legislature with reference to any entry in $$$ the courts must try to harmonise and re -concile which is well known method of construction. the majority view however did not examine the provisions of $$$s for its conclusion as to whether both $$$s could be allowed to operate whereas the judgment of hon'ble mukherjee j proceeds on the basis that both the $$$s could operate in its own field. according to mr. $$$ the principle of occupation of field by a particular legislature is a concept relevant for interpreting an entry in the concurrent $$$ and it will have no application when the legislation in question is under a particular entry in $$$ i. according to mr. $$$ where a particular legislation made by the parliament is found to be occupying the entire field then the extent of occupation of the field would have to be examined with reference to entry of $$$ $$$i to find out which field remains available to the state legislature and if there is any repugnancy then same has to be dealt with with reference to article. but the $$$ in question not having been made tobacco board $$$ with reference to entry of $$$ $$$i conclusion with reference to article was wholly errous. it is lastly urged that the majority view in itc case not having noticed the earlier constitution bench decisions in tikaramji $$$ gas as well as other cases following the same the conclusion is unsustainable in law and therefore this constitution bench must hold that the itc case has not been correctly decided. while interpreting and considering the word industry occurring in different entries of $$$ i and $$$ $$$ it would be wholly inappropriate to refer to the meaning of the word given in encyclopedia of britannica as was held by this court in tikaramji. it is also urged that the scope of constitutional entry in the schedule can never be left to be determined on a case to case basis depending upon how much field the parliament deems fit to cover. the scope of the word industry in entry of $$$ i will not expand or restrict depending upon what the parliament does in its legislation. the competence of parliamentary law can never be adjudged with reference to the nature of the law which is being enacted. the scope of the entries in $$$ $$$ also can not be determined with respect to parliamentary enactment made from time to time. on the other hand the scope of entries have to be determined by reference to each other and by modifying with respect to the other on the basis of the context without making any of the entries otiose. it was so held by this court in the case of mcdowell $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/99. since a law made by a legislature be it parliament or be it the state has to be tested on the anvil of the entries in the schedule of the constitution when a question of legislative competence arises the head of the legislation in any entry can not be differently construed. in other words the word industry occurring in entry of $$$ $$$ as well as entry and entry of $$$ i must have the same meaning. that being the position parliament can not be permitted to amend industry development regulation $$$ by including $$$ as has been held by this court in $$$. mr. $$$ repelled the argument of mr. shanti bhushan that the observations in tikaramji must be confined to the fact from that case on the ground that it is no doubt true that in tikaramji the validity of the parliamentary enactment had not been questid and on the other hand it is the power of the state legislature to enact the $$$ was the subject matter of consideration. but the court did examine the provisions of the state $$$ to find out whether it encroached upon entry of $$$ i as sugar industry was a controlled industry under the provisions of idr $$$. that apart the constitution bench having thoroughly g into the constitutional history including the corresponding entries in the government of india $$$ and then considering a particular provision and ultimately holding that it would not bring within its sweep the raw -materials which is the stage prior to the manufacture of industry it is not permissible for another constitution bench to by pass the earlier constitution bench decision by limiting the ratio therein to the fact of that case more so when the said decision had been followed later on in several other constitution bench decisions and has stood the test for last decades. with reference to $$$ 's case mr. $$$ contends that in the very same judgment the only question that cropped up for consideration is whether the $$$ 's work was a handicraft requiring application of skill and the art of making gold ornaments and was not an industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ i or entry of $$$ $$$i of the schedule the court never examined with reference to entry dealing with agricultural raw -material and in fact the court observed that it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to attempt to define the expression industry precisely or to state exhaustively all the different aspects. the court was however satisfied that the manufacture of gold ornaments by the $$$ is a process of systematic production for trade or manufacture and would therefore fall within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entries. thus harakchand also follows the ratio in tikaramji and not departed from the view taken in tikaramji. in hr $$$ the supreme court rejected the submission to adopt the definition of industry as given in the industrial disputes $$$. according to mr. $$$ the observations of this court in harakchand and $$$ can not be utilised for the purposes of the agricultural raw -material and its production within the word industry in entry of $$$ i how so ever wide the same word may be construed. with reference to the judgment of this court in $$$ mr. $$$ contends that the enunciation of law made therein would indicate that the court was examining to find out by virtue of law made under entry of $$$ i to what extent there has been denudation of the state legislature 's power to legislate under entry of $$$ $$$. the court did find that the extent of erosion is not absolute but only to the extent the control is spelled out by the parliamentary legislation. the extent of parliamentary legislation is seen only to determine how much is taken out from entry of $$$ $$$ and nothing more. though in this case the court relied upon the earlier decision of this court in state of west bengal v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 but unfortunately in the wet bengal case the scope of industry did not fall for consideration and that is why even tikaramji had not been referred to. but it can not be concluded that the constitution bench was departing from tikaramji and laying down some new principles without even discussing tikaramji. mr. $$$ submitted that in $$$ no doubt the judgment of this court in $$$ has been relied upon but the said reference and reliance was for a different purpose and not to equate the structure of entry of $$$ i with entry of $$$ i. the court referred $$$ kedia for the limited purpose as in both cases the denudation of states ' power is only to the extent of control while $$$ dealt with entry of $$$ $$$ $$$ dealt with entry of $$$ $$$. the subject matter of other entries was not in issue. it would therefore be a fallacy to contend that $$$ relied upon $$$ to hold that the entire field is occupied by the central legislation though the majority view in itc case holds so and that must be held to be not correctly decided in view of the series of decisions starting from tikaramji already referred to mr. $$$ in this connection relies upon the constitution bench decision in $$$ company $$$ / sc/0$$$$/$$$$$$$ / sc/0$$$$/$$$$ air$$$$sc air$$$$sc wherein in paragraphs and the cases under mines and mineral regulation and development $$$ had been noticed and the court ultimately held that his scheme of the legislative entries is entirely different from the scheme of entry of $$$ i read with entry of $$$ $$$ with which the court was concerned in $$$. according to mr. $$$ the ratio in $$$ would support the contention on the question of competence of parliament to enact tobacco board $$$ covering the field of growing and raw -material prior to any manufacturing process. mr. $$$ strongly relied upon the full bench decision of allahabad high court in siel 's case $$$ / up/00/99$$$ / up/00/99 air99all air99all and submitted that the full bench had considered all the relevant decisions and has come to the right conclusion. according to mr. $$$ tikaramji principles enunciated therein having been approved in the subsequent cases and even in $$$ case $$$ j. having negatived a similar contention as we urged in the present appeal as a desperate plea and belsund 's case have approved tikaramji irresistible conclusion would be that the majority view in itc judgment is incorrect and necessarily therefore the parliament did not have the legislative competence while enacting the tobacco board $$$ after declaring tobacco industry to be taken over as a controlled industry to make any provision therein relating to growing of tobacco or sale of tobacco within the market area prior to its curing or any subsequent process of manufacturing. dr. a.m. $$$ appearing for the agricultural produce market committee $$$ on an analysis of different entries made in $$$ i $$$ $$$ and $$$ of the schedule submitted that there are as many as entries in $$$ $$$ out of entries which are specifically made subject to $$$ i. of the entries in $$$ $$$ are subject to list. entry of list $$$ however is subject to entry of list i. according to the learned counsel wherever the constitution intended that the entries in list $$$ were to be made subject to entries in list i it was specifically and clearly so provided. where however an entry in list $$$ is not subject to list i or list then the power of the state legislature to legislate with regard to that matter is supreme. the bihar agriculture markets $$$ being relatable to entries to of list $$$ which is not subject to any entry either in $$$ i or $$$ $$$i the same must be held to be supreme and there would be no fetter on the power of the state legislature to make the agricultural produce markets $$$. with reference to the expression subject to $$$ i in mcdowell 's case $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/99 supreme court had itself observed that the power to make a law with respect to industries ' lies with the states under entry of $$$ $$$ but the said entry is made expressly subject to the provisions of entries and in $$$ i. if the parliament declares by law that it is expedient in the public interest to take over the control of a particular industry then such industry gets transplanted to $$$ i. according to the learned counsel the industry in respect of which parliament makes a declaration contemplated under entry of $$$ i the states are denuded of the power to make any law with respect to them under entry of $$$ $$$. but making of a declaration by parliament does not have the effect of transplanting the industry from the state $$$ to the union $$$. entry of $$$ i since governs only entry of $$$ $$$ but not other entry like entry as was the case for discussion in mcdowell 's case the power of the state legislature can not be denied to make a law referable to entry. this being the correct position as enunciated by this court and the founding fathers of the constitution having taken due care by expressly stating when a particular entry in $$$ $$$ is subject to an entry in $$$ i or $$$ $$$i thereby demarcation being made in respect of other entries in $$$ $$$ the power of the state legislature is exclusive and therefore it would be prohibited field for the union to make any law. reiterating the argument advanced by mr. $$$ dr. $$$ also contends that the question of occupied field is only relevant in the case of laws made with reference to entries in $$$. consequently neither entry nor entry being subject to any of the entries in $$$ i the bihar legislature was fully competent to enact the agriculture produce markets $$$ and once in exercise of the provisions contained in the $$$ tobacco is notified to be of the agricultural produce then the power to levy fee for sale for purchase of tobacco within the market area can not be whittled down by the central legislation. according to dr. $$$ the central legislation to that extent must be held to be invalid. the learned counsel further urged that in case of a seeming conflict of entries of lists the entries should be read together without giving a narrow or restrictive sense to either of them and every attempt should be made to see whether the entries can be reconciled or harmonized. this approach to the interpretation is necessary to uphold and promote the federal structure of the constitution which is a basic structure as held by this court in s.r. bommani v. union of india $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99. the fundamental feature of federalism being that within each list each legislature is supreme. there can be no repugnancy between the matters in list i and list $$$ and repugnancy can only be a concept peculiar to list. it is no doubt true that entry of $$$ i over rides only entry of $$$ $$$ and no other entry under $$$ $$$. it has been held by this court in $$$ scc and $$$ $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/99 that trade commerce production distribution of products of alcohol industry can be regulated both by the center and the state. bihar agriculture produce markets $$$ being relatable to entry and of $$$ $$$ that $$$ must operate on its own and not being affected by law made by parliament under entry of $$$ i. in this connection the learned counsel refers to the judgment of this court in belsund $$$ / sc/0$$$$/999$$$ / sc/0$$$$/999 air999sc air999sc. according to dr. $$$ the tobacco $$$ by providing section indicates the intention of the parliament that the $$$ would not govern the entire field in exclusion to all other $$$s in existence. in this view of the matter there can not be any justification in denying the market committee to levy market fee in respect of the sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area as the market committee $$$ is a duly enacted law by the state legislature within its competence to legislate under entry and. dr. $$$ also urged that mere declaration under entry is not enough but the law in question must be found which actually occupied the field. dr. $$$ urged that mere existence of power is not enough but the power must be exercised and on account of such exercise the field must be occupied so as to hold that the central law would collide with the state law. it was so held in belsund $$$ / sc/0$$$$/999$$$ / sc/0$$$$/999 air999sc air999sc with regard to tea. to the same effect is the ratio in the case of western coal fields $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 and fateh chand scc. according to the learned counsel in the case in hand there is no question of conflict or repugnancy between the tobacco $$$ and the bihar $$$ since both $$$s operate in mutually exclusive and different field and therefore the majority judgment in itc case would not apply to the bihar agricultural produce $$$ dr. $$$ also made an extreme argument to the effect that even if the central legislation is construed to occupy the entire filed under list i yet the state $$$ can still be operative and market fee could be levied by the market committee under the state $$$ for services provided by it on the principle of quid pro quo. it is in this connection he placed reliance on the decision in synthetics and chemicals jt. according to dr. $$$ the expression industry both under entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$ i would not cover subject matters which are mentid sui generis in different entries and separately from entry of $$$ $$$. if a wide meaning to the expression is given it would run counter to the scheme of distribution of powers and the structural inter -relationship between entry of $$$ i and entries and of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$ $$$i and would make the state $$$ redundant qua that industry. in this view of the matter the counsel urged that the decisions relating to mines and minerals would not be relevant because of inter -relationship of entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$ i. once the declaration is made by parliament in terms of entry of $$$ i then both mines and its product minerals get extracted from the state list and get submerged in the entry of $$$ i but that would not be the case when the power under entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ $$$ as well as other relevant entry in $$$ $$$ are considered. consequently the majority view in itc case must be over -ruled. mr. g.l. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for $$$ in madhya pradesh batch of appeals submitted that in the case in hand relevant enquiry should be whether the state $$$ is within the exclusive subject matter of the state legislature under entry of $$$ $$$. according to him there is no irreconcilable clash between the $$$s which is also apparent from the mandate of section of the central $$$. the object and purpose of the state $$$ being establishment of market places and the same object having been achieved by the various provisions providing for large scale infrastructural establishment and provision of a large variety of services the state $$$ rightly requires those who avail these services to pay the requisite market fee and also in order to provide for appropriate control to take licenses wherever a market functionary desires to function within the market bard or market area. the provisions of tobacco board $$$ more specifically section however mandates that the board has to apply its mind to provide appropriate measures including the measure of setting up an auction platform and since the auction platform has to have a location the board can not but think it fit to establish such platform within the market area. such a step will be consistent with the mandate of section and therefore it will not be in derogation of the state $$$. the amendment introduced in tobacco board $$$ according to mr. $$$ is achieved by the enforcement of the amending $$$ which exhausts itself by merely introducing the amending provisions into the parent $$$ so that the requirement of sub -section of section of the parent $$$ namely bringing into force the newly added sections will have to be complied with. thus the amended sections as well as section of the $$$ having not been enforced within the state of madhya pradesh there can not be any inconsistency or repugnancy between the $$$s assuming that bringing into force all the said sections may create some inconsistency. according to mr. $$$ the objects of the tobacco board $$$ being development of tobacco industry more particularly in respect of virginia tobacco is not in any manner defeated by the provisions of the state $$$ and the object of the state $$$ are not defeated by the existing or even non -enforced provisions of the tobacco board $$$. in this view of the matter according to mr. $$$ the minority view in itc case must be held to be correct and both the central $$$ and the state $$$ should be permitted to operate in their own sphere.mr. a.k. ganguli the learned senior counsel appearing for the tamil nadu agricultural marketing board analysed the provisions of article of the constitution and contended that the expression subject to appearing in article has reference to those entries in $$$ $$$ which provides that the subject matter of said entries are subject to the provisions contained in certain specified entries appearing in either $$$ i or $$$ as for example entry in $$$ $$$ provides police including railways and village police subject to the provisions of entry a of $$$ i. similar provisions are found in several entries. in $$$ $$$ like entry and but only entries in $$$ namely entries and do not specify any entry in $$$ i or $$$ subject to which the said entries would remain operative but restrict the scope of these entries by a general reference to the provisions contained in $$$ i or $$$. therefore in respect of all other entries in $$$ $$$ the state legislature enjoys the exclusive power to enact laws and consequently if the state $$$ has been enacted under entry of $$$ $$$ the state $$$ must be allowed to operate. the contention that parliament enjoys superior legislative powers with regard to subject matters enumerated in $$$ $$$ according to mr. ganguli would hold good only in respect of those entries in $$$ $$$ which expressly provide that the subject matter thereof are subject to the matters dealt with in various entries in $$$ i. but that principle can not be extended to the subject matters covered by other entries in $$$ $$$. placing reliance on the provision of section of the government of india $$$ which corresponds to article of the constitution which was interpreted by $$$ j in subrahmanyam chettiyar v. $$$ reported in fcr which has been approved by the constitution bench in the case of kseb v. indal $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/9 the counsel urged that the state legislature enjoys exclusive legislative power under article to make laws with respect to the subject matter enumerated in entry of $$$ $$$ i. market and fairs. this power has not been conditid by any restrictions in so far as the distribution of legislative power between the parliament and the state legislature is concerned and consequently this power can not be curtailed or restricted by the exercise of legislative power of the parliament with reference to any of the entries either in $$$ i or $$$. mr. ganguli further contends that the entry in lists of the constitution are not powers but fields of legislation. the power to legislate is given by article. the entries in different lists demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislature can operate. according to him the concept of federal supremacy can not be invoked to deny the state legislature the power to make laws with respect to such subject matters which are exclusively assigned to it under the state list. if a law made by the state legislature is impugned on the ground of incompetency and on examination of the law it is found that the law in substance is with respect to a matter in $$$ $$$ then the law would be valid in its entirety. it is only in case of a seeming conflict between the law made under any of the entries in $$$ i and $$$ then the principle of federal supremacy could be invoked in view of the opening words in article. so far as the meaning of the expression industry in entry of $$$ i the counsel urged that the said word must have the same meaning as would be ascribed to the word in entry of $$$ $$$. so far as the raw materials are concerned it has been held to be goods and would fall within the subject matter comprised in entry of $$$ $$$. the products of the industry would also be comprised in entry of $$$ $$$ except that in the case of controlled industry they would fall under entry of $$$ $$$i and only the process of manufacture and production would fall under entry of $$$ $$$ and if the concerned industry is a declared industry then the process of manufacture and production would fall under entry of $$$ i. it is therefore logical to hold that the activities relating to production and manufacture which would otherwise come within the purview of the expression industry in entry of $$$ $$$ becomes a subject matter of legislation under entry of $$$ i where the industry is a declared industry. therefore such legislative competence of the parliament would not confer power in relation to raw materials which may be an integral part of the industrial process and thereby denuding the state legislature of its power to make laws with respect to subject matters covered by either entries in $$$ $$$. mr. ganguli contends that this court has consistently taken the view that the subject matter of entry of $$$ i pertains to manufacture and production activities and therefore it would not be appropriate that the word industry should have a wider meaning so as to include also the raw materials within the same. with reference to the decisions of this court in relation to law made by the parliament regulating the mines and minerals development mr. ganguli contends that the subject matter of entry of $$$ i is the same as in entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$ $$$ further provides that it should be further subject to the provisions of $$$ i with respect to regulation and development under the control of the union. in such a case therefore once the parliament makes a declaration in section of the mines and minerals development and regulation $$$ then all aspects of regulations and minerals development even including taxes on minerals are covered by the said declaration and therefore the state legislature is denuded of its power to make laws with reference to the subject matter. this has been so held in baij nath kedia v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0$$$$/99$$$ / sc/0$$$$/99 state of orissa v. m.a. $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 india cement v. state of $$$ / $$$ / sc/009/990 and $$$ ltd. v. state of orissa & ors. $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99. but the subject matter of entry of $$$ i and the subject matter comprised in entry of $$$ $$$ both relate to industry and entry of $$$ $$$ is subject to entry and of $$$ i. the state legislature could not have made a law in exercise of power under entry of $$$ $$$ so as to make other entries redundant. according to mr. ganguli the expression industry can not have a wider meaning. on the question of repugnancy mr. ganguli contends that the said question arises only when both legislatures are competent to enact the respective laws and the laws cover the same field. if the laws are found to be operating in the same field and are also found to be inconsistent with each other only then the law made by the parliament would prevail. but that would apply only when the law made by the parliament and state legislature are both in respect of the same subject matter enumerated in the concurrent list as was held in hoechest pharmaceutical $$$ / sc/09/9$$$ / sc/09/9. even in deep chand 's case the sets of laws made by the state legislature and the parliament with respect to the same subject matter enumerated in entry of $$$ $$$i was under consideration and the court was examining the question of repugnancy. but that will have no application to the question involved in the present case inasmuch as the state $$$ falls within the subject matter comprised under entry of $$$ $$$ in respect of which the state legislature enjoys the exclusive power to make laws. on an analysis of the provisions of tobacco board $$$ and section thereof mr. ganguli contends that the provisions of tobacco $$$ would operate only in addition to other laws and therefore that $$$ can not be pressed into service to give an over -riding effect over other legislation including the agricultural produce markets $$$ which has been enacted by the competent state legislature. according to the learned counsel the $$$ over -lap only as regards sale and purchase of tobacco within the notified area and if auction platform registered with board are held within the market area then the so called conflict in the $$$s can be easily avoided and both $$$s would be allowed to operate. while market committee would be entitled to levy fees in respect of sale and purchase of tobacco in the market area for the services rendered including the entire infrastructure the tobacco board $$$ can yet levy fee as provided under tobacco board $$$ which would be a separate fee for special services rendered by it as determined by the central government under section and according to the learned counsel this is the only harmonious construction which should be and ought to be made of the provisions. according to mr. ganguli the majority decisions in itc case are in conflict with $$$ v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 $$$ gas $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 supp. scr kannan devan hills $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 $$$ $$$ / sc/09/99$$$ / sc/09/99 b. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 and therefore the said decisions must be held to be errous. in fact the minority view expressed by justice mukherjee looking at the object of $$$ allowing both the $$$ to operate in their respective fields should be upheld. mr. ganguli contended that though the competence of the parliament to make tobacco board $$$ covering the field exclusively within the competence of the state legislature had not been assailed in any of these writ petitions but in view of the nature of controversy that has arisen and the arguments advanced in the case leaves no room for doubt that each of the parties including the central government as well as the tobacco board had the opportunity of placing its case and therefore there should be no fetter on the power of the court to decide the legislative competence of the parliament in the case in hand. mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for the tobacco board though initially proceeded with the arguments that both $$$s could be reconciled but later on categorically submitted that the central legislation must prevail. according to him the tobacco industry got lifted from entry of $$$ $$$ to entry of $$$ i and the same must be held to be a special $$$ dealing with tobacco industry right from the stage of growing till it is exported. this being a special $$$ and the market and fairs under entry being a general entry and agriculture under entry of $$$ $$$ being a general entry the special $$$ enacted by the parliament must prevail and there is no question of lack of competence of the parliament to enact the law. in support of this contention reliance was placed on the constitution bench decision of this court in $$$ company limited $$$ / sc/0/999$$$ / sc/0/999 air999sc air999sc. mr. $$$ relied upon several decisions of the federal court and this court and contended that entries in the schedule must be given its widest meaning and it would not be a correct approach to give a restricted meaning to the subject matter of legislation described in an entry. in support of this contention he placed reliance on the decision of the federal court in the united provinces v. atiqa begum and ors. fcr0 the additional income -tax officer mysore v. h.n.s. iyengar -$$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 $$$. $$$ v. the union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 navinchandra mafatlal v. the commissir of income tax bombay city -$$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 and $$$ v. the state of bombay -$$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9. the learned counsel also contended that it is a cardinal rule of interpretation that words in an entry should be given their ordinary natural and grammatical meaning subject to the rider that legislative entries are required to be interpreted broadly and widely so as to give powers to the legislatures to enact the law with respect to the matters enumerated in the legislative entries. he places reliance on the decision of this court in r.s. $$$ $$$ / sc/0/99$$$ / sc/0/99 air99sc9 air99sc9 $$$ and ors. v. the state of bihar -$$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 and indian aluminium company and ors. v. state of kerala and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99. he also referred to the case of harakchand $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 which had been relied upon by mr. shanti bhushan in his arguments. mr. $$$ contends that the majority decision in itc case therefore must be held to be correct. the learned additional solicitor general mr. $$$ appearing for the attorney general of india placed before us the process of manufacture of tobacco and indicated how tobacco is grown commercially. to emphasise on the issue he contended that the tobacco industry having been notified to be a controlled industry it will be a disaster if the parliament is held to have no competence to make law in relation to growing of tobacco or processing of raw tobacco. according to the learned additional solicitor general the trade and commerce in product of control industry being covered by entry of $$$ i the legislative power of the state is subordinate to the power of the parliament in respect of $$$. he further contended that the constitution itself has specifically put down entries in $$$ $$$ in which the power is expressed in general terms but is made subject to the provisions of entries in either list i or list. consequently no anomaly will arise in holding exclusive power with the parliament in respect of the subject coming under any entry in $$$ i. he further contended that tobacco board $$$ covers the entire field of tobacco industry and is within the competence of parliament under entry of $$$ i. tikaramji was a case which concerned only with a part of the industry namely manufacture of sugar. the observations made in tikaramji $$$ / sc/000/9$$$ / sc/000/9 were in the background of that case as in that case the court was concerned with the entire process as in the present case. according to the learned additional solicitor general it was not necessary for the court to examine the ambit of the expression industry in entry of $$$ i. if the ordinary principle of construction of an entry in the legislative list is that the entry should be given wide meaning as has been held in several cases of this court there is no reason why on the basis of the said observations made in tikaramji the court would give a limited meaning to the expression industry in entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$ i. with reference to the judgment of this court in h.r. banthia $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 the learned additional solicitor general stated that for the purposes of that case it was not necessary for the court to make an attempt to define the expression industry. the court was merely concerned with the question whether manufacture of gold ornaments would be a process of systematic product so as to fall within the expression industry in the appropriate legislative entry. the court did come to that conclusion. the learned additional solicitor general also contended the case of harakchand $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 is in consonance with the principle of interpretation of an entry and should be applied to the case in hand. the learned addl. solicitor general contends that the constitution being an organic document has to be interpreted in its widest amplitude. according to the learned addl. solicitor general the majority decision in itc case must be held to be the correct law. the counsel states that the validity of the tobacco board $$$ was also not under challenge in the itc case which stood disposed of by the judgment of this court since reported in $$$ / sc/000/$$$$$$$ / sc/000/$$$$ and therefore it would not be appropriate for this court to examine the legislative competence of the parliament in relation to the enactment of the tobacco board $$$. though several counsel have raised contentions in different forms as indicated earlier but essentially the following questions arise for our determination:-. whether the tobacco board $$$ enacted by the parliament under entry of $$$ i can be held to be constitutionally valid and within the legislative competence of the parliament so far as the provisions contained in the same in relation to the growing of tobacco and sale of raw -materials and this in turn would depend upon the question whether the word industry used in entry of $$$ i should be given a restricted . even if the tobacco board $$$ is held to be constitutionally valid and the agricultural produce market $$$ is also held to be constitutionally valid and within the powers of the state legislature so far as purchase and sale of tobacco within the market area is concerned whether both the $$$s can be allowed to operate as was held by the minority judgment in itc case;. if there is a repugnancy between the then whether the central $$$ would prevail as was held by the majority judgment in itc case. but before considering several elaborate arguments advanced on these issues it may be noticed that the constitution of india itself defines the political authority locates the sources of political power and also indicates how the power has to be exercised setting out the limits on its own use. the rules relating to the distribution of legislative power by providing the legislative heads for the parliament to make law in respect of subjects enumerated in $$$ i and similarly enumerating the subjects in $$$ $$$ with respect to which the state legislature can frame law in fact constitutes the heart of the federal scheme of the constitution. but the constitution makers having found that the need for power sharing devices between the central and the state must be subordinated to the imperatives of the state 's security and stability propelled the thrust towards centralization and by using non obstante clause under article the federal supremacy is achieved. article of the constitution deals with the distribution of legislative powers as between the union and the state legislature with reference to the different $$$s in the schedule. the various entries in $$$s of the schedule are not powers of legislation but the fields of legislation. the entry in the $$$ and legislative heads and are of enabling character. they are designed to define and limit the respective areas of legislative competence of the union and the state legislature. it is a well recognised principle that the language of entry should be given a widest scope and each general word should be interpreted to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it. the entries in the $$$s should be read together without giving a narrow or restricted meaning to any of them. powers of the union and the state legislatures are both expressed in precise and in definite terms and therefore there can be no reason in such a case in giving broader interpretation to rather than to the other. it is only when an apparent overlapping occurs the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to find out the true nature of legislation and the entry within which it would fall. when different entries in the same $$$ crop up for consideration the usual principle followed is that each particular entry should relate to a separate subject or group of subjects and every attempt should be made to harmonise different entries and to discard a construction which will render any of the entries ineffective. coming to the case in hand the relevant entries which arise for our consideration are entries of $$$ i entry of $$$ $$$ and entry of $$$. under entry of $$$ tobacco board $$$ has been enacted by parliament and under entry of $$$ $$$ the agricultural produce market $$$ has been framed by the state legislature. incidentally also entry of $$$ and entries and of $$$ crop up for consideration. it would therefore be appropriate to indicate those entries hereunder:"list -ientry -industries declared by parliament by law to be necessary for the purpose of defence or for the prosecution of war.entry -industries the control of which by the union is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.list -$$$entry -industries subject to the provisions of entries and of $$$ i.entry -production supply and distribution of goods subject to the provisions of entry of $$$ $$$i andentry -markets and fairs. though the state legislature has power to make law in relation to any industry under entry of $$$ $$$ but the said entry itself being subject to the provisions of entries and of $$$ i once parliament makes a declaration by law identifying an industry the control of which is taken over by the union in the public interest then the state legislature is denuded of its competence to make any law in respect of that industry notwithstanding its competence under entry of $$$ $$$. the industry in question having been identified and necessary declaration to that effect being made in terms of entry of $$$ i then over that subject the parliament gets exclusive power to make laws under article of the constitution. the tobacco board $$$ having been enacted by the parliament under article of the constitution and the law in question being referable to entry of $$$ i the moot question that arises for adjudication is what is the extent and ambit of the expression industry used in entry. as has been stated earlier the expression industry has been used in entry of $$$ $$$ and entry and entry of $$$ i. in deciding the legislative competence of the parliament in enacting tobacco board $$$ and in making provision therein in relation to the growing of tobacco as well as sale of tobacco in the places specified therein and on terms and conditions mentid therein the moot question is whether the word industry would be given a wide meaning so as to bring within its ambit all that is necessary for the industry including the raw material as well as the growing of the raw material as contended by mr. shanti bhushan or a restricted meaning would be given to the same on the basis of the observations made by this court in tikaramji 's case and followed in several other authorities as contended by mr. $$$. in the majority judgment of this court in itc case $$$ / sc/0007/$$$$$$$ / sc/0007/$$$$ supp. scr the majority view expressed by $$$ j. came to hold that the center having taken over an industry under entry of $$$ i and having passed the $$$ to regulate the legislation and the said legislation having covered the entire field the state legislatures ceases to have any jurisdiction to legislate in that field and if it does so then the state legislation would be ultra vires of the powers of the state legislature. even the minority view expressed by hon'ble justice sabyasachi mukherjee also accepts the recognised principle of parliamentary supremacy in the field of legislation engrafted in article. the learned judge also held that the words in a constitutional document conferring legislative powers should be construed most liberally and in their widest amplitude following the judgment of this court in $$$ v. cit bombay $$$ / sc/0070/$$$ / sc/0070/. the minority view also was not to the effect that the tobacco board $$$ was beyond the legislative competence of the parliament. on the other hand having held the tobacco board $$$ to be constitutionally valid and the agricultural market $$$ enacted by the state legislature to be a valid piece of legislation the learned judge came to hold that the said $$$ essentially dealing with the object to regulate marketing of agricultural produce and the control of coffee for tobacco industry would not be defeated if the marketing of coffee for tobacco is d within the provisions of marketing $$$ the state legislatures ' power to make marketing $$$ ought not to be denuded and must avoid corroding the state 's ambit of power of legislation which will ultimately lead to erosion of india being a union of states. the minority view appears to have been influenced by the fact that the states must have the power to raise and mobilize resources in their exclusive fields. thus all the learned judges did not doubt the competence of the parliament to enact tobacco board $$$. while the majority view was to the effect that the marketing $$$ will not operate so far as dealing with the sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area as the field is fully occupied by the central $$$ namely the tobacco board $$$ the minority view proceeded on a finding that both $$$s can be permitted to operate in their respective sphere. in the constitution bench decision of this court in harakchand $$$ and ors. etc. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ the legislative competence of the parliament under entry of $$$ i came up for consideration while dealing with validity of the provisions of the gold control $$$ which $$$ included within its ambit the gold ornaments. of the contention that had been advanced was that the goldsmith 's work was handicraft requiring application of skills and the art of making gold ornaments was not an industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ i. it had been contended on behalf of the union government that the legislative entry must be construed in a large and liberal sense and goldsmith 's craft was an industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ $$$ as well as entry of $$$ i and therefore parliament was competent to legislate in regard to the manufacture of gold ornaments. having considered the relevant entries namely entry of $$$ i and entry and of $$$ $$$ the constitution bench had observed that -it is well established that the widest amplitude should be given to the language of the entries. the court in that case did not think it necessary to attempt to define the expression industry precisely or to state exhaustively of its different aspects but considered the question whether the manufacture of gold ornaments by goldsmith in india falls within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entries. the court unequivocally rejected the contention raised by mr. daphtary that if the process of production was to constitute industry a process of machinery or mechanical contrivance was essential as in the opinion of the court there is no reason why such a limitation should be imposed on the meaning of the word industry in the legislative lists. the court also rejected the argument advanced on behalf of mr. $$$ that manufacture of gold ornaments was not an industry because it required application of individual art and craftsmanship as in the opinion of the court mere use of the skill or art is not a decisive factor and it was held that the said factor will not take the manufacture of gold ornaments out of the ambit of the relevant legislative entries. it is in this connection the court observed it is well settled that the entries in the lists are only legislative heads or fields of legislation and they demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislature can operate. the legislative entries must be given a large and liberal interpretation the reason being that the allocation of subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but is a mere enumeration of broad and comprehensive categories. the court ultimately came to the conclusion that the manufacture of gold ornaments by goldsmith in india is a process of systematic production for trade or manufacture and so falls within the connotation of the word industry in the appropriate legislative entries. at page of the aforesaid judgment while construing as to what is the meaning of the word industry in entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ $$$ it referred to the definition of industry in shorter oxford english dictionary as well as the meaning of the said word in $$$ 's new international dictionary and the contention raised on behalf of the applicant that if the word industry is construed in this wide sense then entry of $$$ $$$ will lose all meanings and contents was not accepted by the court. it is thus clear that the court did apply the theory that widest amplitude and meaning should be given to the entries in the legislative lists. further the contention of the applicant that the legislation in fact is a legislation under entry of $$$ $$$ dealing with production supply and distribution of goods and being a special entry the contents of entry should be excluded from the expression industry in entry was not accepted and rejected. in chaturbhai m. $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/00/9$$$ / sc/00/9 a constitution bench of this court was construing the entries under the government of india $$$ and of the contention raised in that case was sections and of the central excise & salt $$$ and the $$$s made thereunder were beyond the legislative competence of the central legislature. the relevant entries which came up for consideration in that case were entry of $$$ i and entries and of the state $$$ which are as under:-". duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in india except:-(a alcoholic liquors for human consumption(b opium indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics non -narcotic drugs;(c medical and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub -paragraph b of this entry.item. trade and commerce within the province markets and fairs my lending and my lenders.item. production supply and distribution of goods development of industries subject to the provisions in $$$ i with respect to the development of certain industries under federal control. a bare look at those entries and on being compared with the entries in list of the schedule of the constitution of india it appears that entry of the state $$$ under the government of india $$$ now comprises of entries and of $$$ $$$ of the schedule and entry of the state $$$ in the government of india $$$ is now combined in entry of the state $$$ relating to production supply and distribution of goods and also entry of $$$ $$$ namely development of industries. in the aforesaid constitution bench decision a passage from the judgment of the federal court reported in $$$ / $$$ / fe/000/$$$$ f.c.r. was quoted which may be extracted hereunder:"it must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation though purporting to deal with a subject in list touches also on a subject in another list and the different provisions of the enactment may be so closely intertwined that blind adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation would result in a large number of statutes being declared invalid because the legislature enacting them may appear to have legislated in a forbidden sphere. the constitution bench approved the aforesaid if judgment of the federal court and referring to the judgment of this court in the state of rajasthan v. g. chawla $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ the court held.it is equally well -settled that the power to legislate e on a topic of legislation carries with it the power to legislate on an ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included in the power given. the court ultimately held that the federal legislature did have the competence to make provisions in sections and of the central excise & salt $$$ under entry of $$$ of the government of india $$$ and observed thus:"it is within the competence of the central legislation to provide for matter which may otherwise fall within the competence of the provincial legislature if they are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the central legislature on a subject of legislation expressly within its power. this indicates that the court has all along been construing a particular legislative entry to give wide connotation possible and in that case it was held while legislating upon an industry parliament would be entitled to legislate also on the raw materials of that industry which is an ancillary to the industry and there should not be any limitation in interpreting the expression industry to denude the power of the parliament and thereby make the law ineffective. in the aforesaid judgment of this court it has been held:"looking at the scheme of the $$$ its object and purpose its true nature and character and the pith and substance the conclusion in inevitable that the $$$ was within the legislative competence of the central legislature and although there may be certain matters otherwise within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature they are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the central legislature. the various provisions of the $$$ and the $$$ made thereunder were in our opinion essentially connected with the levying & collection of excise duty and in its true nature and character the $$$ remains that falls under item of $$$ i and the incidental trenching upon the provincial filed of items or would not affect its constitutionality because the extend of invasion of the provincial filed may be a circumstances to determine the true pith and substance but once that question is determined the $$$ in our opinion would fall on the side of the central field and not that of the provincial field. in synthetics and chemicals ltd. and ors. v. state of u.p. and ors. $$$ / sc/06/0$$$ / sc/06/0 it was held that the constitution must not be construed in any narrow or pedantic sense and that construction which is most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its power must be adopted. in the said case after noticing the principle of construction in relation to a constitutional provisions providing division of power and jurisdiction in federal constitutional scheme it was held:"it is well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of the entries in $$$s but some of these entries in different lists or in the same list may override and sometimes may appears to be in direct conflict with each other then and then only comes the duty of the court to find the true intent and purpose and to examine the particular legislation in question. each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it. in interpreting an entry it would not be reasonable to import any limitation by comparing or contrasting that entry with any other in the same list. in express hotels private ltd. v. state of gujarat and anr. $$$ / sc/079/9$$$ / sc/079/9. the court was no doubt interpreting some entries providing for taxes on luxuries but dealing with the general principles of an entry in a legislative list the court held:"we are dealing with an entry in a legislative $$$. the entries should not be read in a narrow or pedantic sense but must be given their fullest meaning and the widest amplitude and be held to extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in them. as has been stated earlier even in his minority judgment in itc case justice mukherjee had observed:"it is well settled that the cardinal rule of interpretation is that the words should be read in their ordinary natural and grammatical meaning. but words in a constitutional document conferring legislative powers should also be construed most liberally and in their widest amplitude. in view of the aforesaid rules of interpretation as well as the constitution bench decision referred to above it is difficult for us to accept the contention of mr. $$$ that the word industry in entry of $$$ i should be given a restricted meaning so as to exclude from its purview the subject of legislation coming within entry or entry of $$$. bearing in mind the constitutional scheme of supremacy of parliament the normal rule of interpretation of an entry in any of the list in the schedule of the constitution the object of taking over the control of the tobacco industry by the parliament on making a declaration as required under entry of $$$ i and on examining the different provisions of the tobacco board $$$ we see no justification for giving a restricted meaning to the expression industry in entry of $$$ i nor do we find any justification in the contention of the counsel appearing for the states and also different market committees that the provisions contained in tobacco board $$$ dealing with the growing of tobacco as well as making provisions for sale and purchase of tobacco must be held to be beyond the legislative competence of the parliament as it does not come within the so -called narrow meaning of the expression industry on the ground that otherwise it would denude the state legislature of its power to make law dealing with market under entry dealing with agriculture under entry and dealing with goods under entry of $$$. such an approach of interpretation in our considered opinion would be against the very scheme of the constitution and supremacy of the parliament and such an approach towards interpreting the power sharing devices in relation to entries in $$$ i and $$$ would be against the thrust towards centralization. in our considered opinion therefore the word industry in entry of $$$ i should not be given any restricted meaning and should be interpreted in a manner so as to enabling the parliament to make law in r elation to subject matter which is declared and whose control has been taken over to bring within its sweep any ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included within the power and which may be incidental to the subject of legislation so that the parliament would be able to make an effective law. so constructed and on examining different provisions of the tobacco board $$$ we do not find any lack of legislative competence with the parliament so as to enact any of the provisions contained in the said $$$ the $$$ in question having been enacted by the parliament on a declaration being made of taking over of the control of the tobacco industry by the union and the $$$ the intended for the development of the said industry. the main prop of the argument advanced by mr. $$$ is the decision of this court in tikaramji which was followed in $$$ gas kanandevan and $$$ corporation all of which are constitution bench decisions. in tikaramji no doubt the constitution bench of this court held that the raw materials which are integral part of the industrial process can not be included in the process of manufacture or production and thus industry within the meaning of entry of $$$ i under which the parliament makes a law would not bring within its sweep the raw materials. the aforesaid observations had been made in connection with sugar industry and sugar -cane. according to mr. $$$ the majority decision in itc case can not be sustained since the earlier constitution bench decision of this court in tikaramji $$$ gas kanandevan and $$$ corporation have not noticed. mr. $$$ 's further contention is that a legislative entry in any $$$ should be so interpreted so as not to denude another entry in the same list or in any other list and therefore it is necessary to give a restricted meaning to the expression industry occurring in entry of $$$ as well as entry of $$$. according to mr. $$$ while examining the constitutionality of the market committee $$$ referable to entries and of $$$ vis -a -vis the sugar -cane $$$ referable to entry of $$$i in $$$ this court has held that the market committee $$$ should be subject to $$$. applying the same principle it would be logical to hold that the raw tobacco which would be a produce of agriculture and consequently a raw material for the tobacco industry would continue to be with in the exclusive domain of the state legislature and the parliament is incompetent to make any legislation in relation to either growing to tobacco or sale and purchase to tobacco. it would therefore be necessary to examine what really this court in tikaramji has held. at the outset it may by noticed that in n of these cases relied upon by mr. $$$ namely tikaramji calcutta gas kanandevan and $$$ the competence of parliament to make any law referable to entry of $$$ i had not been questid. in tikaramji the question for consideration was whether the at passed by the state legislature and notification issued thereunder is repugnant to the parliament $$$ and notification issued thereunder. on examining the provisions of the state $$$ namely the$$$ $$$ the court held that the said law concerns solely with the regulation of supply and purchase of sugarcane and in no way trenched upon the jurisdiction of the center with regard to sugar and on scrutiny of section of the industries development and regulation $$$ the court held that the $$$ more specifically section -g did not cover sugarcane nor even the parliament 's intention to cover the entire field could be inferred. the court was required to find out the meaning of the expression any article or class or articles relatable to any scheduled industry used in section and it held that it did not refer to the raw materials but only to the finished products. the court went into the object to the central $$$ which was equitable distribution and availability of manufactured articles at fair prices. the argument that had been advanced in that case was that the$$$ $$$ enacted by the state legislature though appears to be a legislation in regard to sugarcane required for use in sugar factory but in pith and substances and its true nature is a legislation in regard to sugar industry which had been declared under the industries development and regulation $$$ and control of the industry had been taken over by the union. negativing that contention and on examining the contents of entry of $$$nd entry of the said $$$ the court observed that the controlled industries were relegated to entry of $$$ i which was the exclusive province of parliament leaving the other industries within entry of $$$. in that case the court was not required to examine the content and scope of the expression industry in entry of $$$ i and in fact the court observed that it was concerned with as to whether the raw materials of an industry which form an integral part of the process are within the topic of industry which form the subject matter of item of $$$ i. the central legislation which was under consideration in that case as well as the notifications issued by the central government were held to have been enacted by the parliament in exercise of the legislative power conferred upon it by entry of $$$ $$$i and was an exercise of concurrent jurisdiction and once the law is made by the parliament in the exercise of its concurrent jurisdiction then it would not deprive the provincial legislature of similar powers which they had under he provincial legislative $$$. it is important to notice the findings of the court in that case:"it follows as a necessary corollary that even though sugar industry was a controlled industry n of these $$$s enacted by the center was in exercise of its jurisdiction under entry of $$$ i. whatever observations the court made on which mr. $$$ placed strong reliance therefore can not be made use of indicating the ambit and contents of the expression industry under entry of $$$ i. when the court observed that the terms industry which would be capable of comprising different aspects i raw materials which are an integral part of the industrial process the process of manufacture or production and the distribution of the products of the industry and held that raw materials should be goods which would be comprised of entry of $$$ $$$ and the process of manufacture or production would be comprised in entry of $$$ $$$ except where the industry was a controlled industry when it would fall under entry of $$$ i the court was obviously not examining the contents of the expression industry under entry of $$$ i and that is why the court observed that the legislation which was enacted by the center in regard to sugar and sugarcane could fall within entry of $$$ i. when the legislation in question that was under consideration was held not to be legislation under entry of $$$ i the question of applying the ratio in the case of tikaramji in the context of parliament 's power to make a law under entry of $$$ i and the content and scope of such law or the scope and content of the expression industry under entry of $$$ i can not have any application and consequently on the basis of the judgment of this court in tikaramji it can not be contended that the expression industry in entry of $$$ i must have a restricted meaning. it is further apparent from the conclusion of the court in that case when it refused to import the pith and substance argument holding that the same can not be imported for the simple reasons that both the center as well as the state legislatures were operating in the concurrent field and therefore there was no question of any trespass upon the exclusive jurisdiction vested in the center under entry of $$$ i. in other words in tikaramji neither this court was called upon to examine the content of the expression industry under entry of $$$ i nor the relevant central law which was under consideration had been enacted with reference to power under entry of $$$ i. this being the position we do not find much force in the submission of mr. $$$ that the conclusion recorded by the majority view in itc case is vitiated as it had not noticed observations of the constitution bench decision in tikaramji. in our opinion it would be wholly inappropriate for this court to apply the observations made in tikaramji 's case with regard to raw materials of industry. the court in tikaramji 's case having not been called upon to determine the question whether the expression industry in entry of $$$ i should be given a restricted meaning at all is contended by mr. $$$ it would be wholly inappropriate to import the observations in tikaramji for construing the ambit and content of the subject head of legislation industry under entry of $$$ i. since the court was examining the provisions of industries development and regulation $$$ which regulated the manufacturing process until section was brought in amendment in the year and the industries development and regulation $$$ did not purport to regulate the trade and commerce in the raw materials namely sugarcane and the court n fact was scrutinizing whether the state $$$ enacted by the state legislature could be held to be repugnant to the central legislators it found that there exits no repugnancy and the $$$s cover different fields and would co -exists. in this view of the matter any observations or conclusion of the court in tikaramji will be of no assistance to us arriving at a decision as to whether the term industry in entry of $$$ i would have a restricted meaning or would have a wide meaning which is the normal interpretation of every entry in the respective lists. in calcutta gas case no doubt tikaramji had been followed and the court was examining the competing entries in list $$$ itself of the schedule of the constitution namely entry and. while entry of $$$ ii is industry entry is gas and gas works and the question therefore was whether law made by the state legislature on the subject head gas and gas works would prevail over a law made by the state legislature over the subject industry and the court held that gas works being a special subject head law made thereunder would prevail over any law made under the general head industries. it may be observed that in the calcutta gas case supp. s.c.r.at page it has been held it is not necessary in this case to attempt to define the expression industry precisely or to state exhaustively all its ingredients.in view of the aforesaid observations we fail to understand how this decision can be pressed into service for ascertaining the true import and content of the expression industry which is the subject head under consideration in the case in hand. coming to the decision of this court in kanandevan hills produce v. state of kerala $$$ / sc/0/197$$$ / sc/0/197 as has been stated earlier it is the validity of state legislation namely resumption of lands $$$ which was under challenge on the ground of lack of legislative competence of the state legislature. the validity of the $$$ was upheld on a conclusion that the law was referable to the legislative head under entry of $$$ ii relating to land and legislative entry of $$$ iii relating to acquisition and requisitioning of property. it is in that context it was observed that the power of the state legislature to make the law under the aforesaid entries could not be denied merely on the ground that it had some effect on the industry the control of which has been taken over under entry of $$$ i. but the court was careful to hold that the effect was not the same thing as subject mater. in other words the subject matter of industry under entry of $$$ i really was not under consideration. in paragraph of the said judgment referring to the case of baijnath kedia v. state of bihar where the court had construed entry of $$$ i and entry of $$$ i it observed that the scope of entry of the union $$$ is slightly different and once it is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in public interest to control an industry parliament can legislate on that particular industry and the states would lose their power to legislate on the industry. necessarily therefore if the law made by the parliament in relation to a controlled industry the control of which has been taken over by a declaration in the law then there can not be any limitation on the power of the parliament to make any provision having a reasonable and direct nexus with the industry. but at the same time the parliament can not make a law which would have no connection at all with the concerned industry. this in our opinion is what has been expressed in paragraph of the aforesaid judgment but by no stretch of imagination the aforesaid judgment of the court in kanan devan can be constructed to be an authority for interpreting the expression industry in entry of $$$ i by giving it a restricted meaning as contended by mr. $$$. in kanan devan the petitir therein had assailed the competence of the state legislature to enact the legislation in question and had relied upon tikaramji which has been referred to in paragraph of the judgment. but the court in paragraph holds that n of these cases assist the petitirs. in the aforesaid premises we fail to understand how the decision in kanan devan will be of any assistance to the respondent -state of bihar in support of the contention that the parliament had no legislative competence to enact the tobacco board $$$ under entry of $$$ i so as to include within the same the provisions relating to growth of tobacco as well as sale and purchase of raw tobacco within the market area. the observations of this court in the constitution bench decision of $$$ corpn. case $$$ / sc/097/1979$$$ / sc/097/1979 on which mr. $$$ strongly relied upon though facie appears to be supporting the contention of the learned counsel for the state of bihar but a deeper scrutiny of the same would make it crystal clear that the said observation is of no consequence either in the matter of deciding the ambit of the expression industry in entry of $$$ i or in deciding the legislative competence of parliament to make law like the tobacco board $$$ in relation to a controlled industry and making provision therein in respect of the growing of tobacco and purchase and sale of raw tobacco. in $$$ 's case the levy of purchase tax on sugar -cane purchased by a factory owner under section of the u.p. $$$ purchase tax $$$ was under challenge on the ground that the legislation in question being in respect of a controlled industry the power belongs exclusively to parliament under entry of $$$ i. the court repelled this contention on the ground that entry in $$$ ii of the schedule empowers the state to legislate for taxes on purchase of goods and therefore it can not be said to have invaded entry of $$$ i. the composed the question as to whether the purchase tax $$$ is bad because it is a legislation with respect to a controlled industry namely the sugar industry and answered the same in the negative following the observations of the earlier constitution bench decision in tikaramji 's case. thus the extreme argument that the state legislature is incompetent to make any law with regard to a controlled industry the control of which has been taken over by the union government by making a declaration was negatived and it is in that context the observations on which mr. $$$ relied upon had been made. we are unable to accept the submission of mr. $$$ to hold that the decision of this court in $$$ can be pressed into service for a contention that the parliament had no legislative competence to make a legislation in respect of a controlled industry like tobacco and enacting the tobacco $$$ and making provision therein in relation to growing of tobacco as well as sale and purchase of raw tobacco. in our considered opinion this decision is of no assistance to support the contention of mr. $$$ appearing for the state of bihar that the expression industry in entry of $$$ i must be given a narrow meaning so as to include only the process of manufacture or production and nothing further. we also reiterate that in n of these aforesaid constitution bench decisions of this court relied upon by mr. $$$ appearing for the state of bihar the true import and meaning of the expression industry under entry of $$$ i was for consideration nor the competence of the parliament to make a legislation in respect of a controlled industry so as to include within itself the provisions relating to the stage prior to manufacture or production was an issue and consequently these decisions will be of no assistance so as to strike down the provisions of the tobacco board $$$ so far as the provisions contained therein relating to growing of tobacco / or sale and purchase of raw tobacco. it is no doubt true that in ishwari khetan 's case $$$ / $$$ / sc/0069/190 while construing entry of $$$ i and the effect of the declaration made thereunder by the parliament the court has relied upon also the legislation made under entry of $$$ i which was held to be in pari materia with entry of $$$ i and the earlier decision of this court in baij nath kedia 's case has been followed as contended by mr. shanti bhushan but we need not embark upon an inquiry in that respect in view of our conclusion on the question as to what would be the ambit and extent of the expression industry occurring in entry of $$$ i. in ishwari khetan 's case the court was construing the scope and ambit of entry of $$$ ii and entry of $$$ i and had observed that the state 's power under entry of $$$ ii would get eroded only to the extent the control is assumed by the union pursuant to a declaration made by the parliament in respect of declared industry as spelt out by legislative enactment and the field occupied by such enactment is the measure of erosion and subject to such erosion on the remainder the state legislature will have power to legislate in respect of declared industry without in any way trenching upon the occupied field. applying the aforesaid ratio to the case in hand and having examined the provisions of the tobacco board $$$ the answer is irresistible that the state legislature is denuded of its power to make any law in relation to growing of tobacco or sale and purchase of raw tobacco when such a provision has already been made in the tobacco board $$$.the other decisions which require to be noticed by us are the case of viswanathiah & co. v. state of karnataka $$$ / sc/060/1991$$$ / sc/060/1991 and $$$ $$$ / sc/07/1999$$$ / sc/07/1999 air1999sc1 air1999sc1. so far as viswanthiah 's case is concerned mr. $$$ relied upon the observations made in paragraph of the said judgment wherein the court had observed:-"it is true the silk board $$$ purports to control the raw silk industry in the territory of india. but as pointed out by the high court inn the light of the earlier decisions of this court therein referred to the control of the industry vested in parliament was only restricted to the aspect of production and manufacture of silk yarn or silk. it did not obviously take in the earlier stages of the industry namely the supply of raw materials. according to mr. $$$ this decision lends support to his contention that the industry in entry of $$$ i will have to be given a restricted meaning and as such it would not cover either the growing of tobacco or dealing with sale and purchase of raw tobacco. as has been held by us earlier the power of the state legislature gets denuded to the extent the central legislation occupies the filed in respect of the controlled industry the control of which has been taken over by the parliament on a declaration being made. if after taking over the control of the industry in exercise of its legislative competence under entry of $$$ i the parliament while making a law did no make any provision in relation to the supply of raw material then merely because the control of the industry has been taken over the state 's power to make legislation in relation to the supply of raw -material would not get denuded. but that does not mean that the parliament can not make any law in relation to any other aspect other than the aspect of production and manufacture of the industry. in other words the contention of mr. $$$ that the parliament 's competence to make any law in respect of the legislative head industry in entry of $$$ i would entitle the parliament to make a law only with respect to the production and manufacture and not any earlier stage can not be accepted to be correct and the aforesaid decision of this court can not be held to have laid down the law in that way. so far as $$$ company 's case is concerned the question for confederation was whether the provisions of the bihar agricultural produce markets $$$ would at all be applicable for levy of market fee in respect of sale and purchase of sugar cane in view of the special provisions contained in the bihar sugar cane regulation of supply and purchase $$$. the market committee act was also a state legislation purported to have been enacted under entries and of $$$ ii. the sugar cane regulation of supply and purchase $$$ purported to be a legislation enacted in entry of $$$. the court held that in view of the special $$$ dealing with sale and purchase of sugar cane the general $$$ namely the market committee $$$ will have no application at all and therefore the levy of market fee by the market committee was held to be invalid. on examining different provisions of the $$$s the court also held that there consists direct conflict between the $$$s and that conflict could be avoided only if it is held that the market $$$ being a general $$$ covering all types of the agricultural produce and the sugar cane $$$ which also deals with an agricultural produce like sugar being a special enactment laying down an independent exclusive machinery for regulating sale purchase and storage of such a commodity under a special $$$ then the special $$$ would prevail over the general $$$ for that commodity and by necessary implication will take the said commodity out of the sweep of the general $$$. this decision in our considered opinion is not an authority for the proposition that the expression industry in entry of $$$ i should be given a restricted meaning as contended by mr. $$$. in that case also the extreme contention that there exists possibility of issuance of control order by the central government would denude the state legislature of its authority to make a law in respect of any matter coming under any of the entries in $$$ ii was not accepted. but at the same time it is difficult for us to construe the aforesaid decision of having laid down a ratio that in dealing with a central legislating in relation to a controlled industry the control of which has been taken over by a declaration made by law enacted by parliament would not clothe the central legislature to make any law other than production or manufacture of the industry in question. $$$ supra by no stretch of imagination can be construed to have even remotely held that he word industry ought to receive a restricted meaning. the said decision therefore does not support the contention of mr. $$$ appearing for the state of bihar as well as for the state of karnataka. mr. shanti bhushan learned senior counsel no doubt argued with vehemence that the principle enunciated in hingir -rampur coal co. ltd. and ors. v. the state of orissa and ors. $$$ / sc/007/1960$$$ / sc/007/1960 $$$ $$$ / sc/07/1999$$$ / sc/07/1999 air1999sc1 air1999sc1 and state of orissa v. m.a. tulloch & co. $$$ / sc/001/196$$$ / sc/001/196 should equally apply to the case in hand while interpreting the scope and extent of the legislative competence of the parliament under entry of $$$ i but we do not think it necessary to apply the ratio in the aforesaid cases inasmuch as in all those cases the court was considering the competing power of the state legislature under entry of $$$ ii and the power of the central legislature under entry of $$$ i. both the entries are on the subject regulation of mines and minerals development. entry of $$$ itself is subject to the provision of $$$ i with respect to the regulation and development under control of the union and necessarily therefore when union takes over the control of the mines and minerals development by legislation under entry of $$$ i the state legislature would be denuded to make any law in relation to the mines and minerals development under entry of $$$ ii. but in the case in land we are concerned with the legislation made by the parliament under entry of $$$ i which is the tobacco board act and the legislation made by the state legislature under entry or any other ancillary entry like entry or entry of $$$ ii namely the bihar agricultural produce market act. in such a case the focus for consideration of the court would be as to what is the scope and content of entry of $$$ i and once it is held that the expression industry can not be given any restricted meaning and the law enacted by the parliament the tobacco board act is held to be intra vires then the state legislation namely the bihar agricultural produce market act so far as it deals with the commodity tobacco will go out of the general sweep of all agricultural produce notified under the state act as the provisions in respect thereof have been made by the central legislating and by application of article of the constitution the central act would prevail. mr. $$$ placed reliance on the full bench decision of allahabad high court in siel 's case supra but in view of our conclusions already arrived at the aforesaid full bench decision must be held not to have been correctly decided. it is also difficult for us to accept the submission of dr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the market committee of monghyr that if the subject head of legislation in $$$ ii is not subject to the corresponding entry in $$$ i then the power of state legislature to legislate with regard to that matter is paramount and supreme and therefore the market committee act being relatable to entries and of $$$ ii which are not subject to any of the entries of $$$ i the market committee act must be allowed to prevail. in out considered opinion the aforesaid approach to consider the validity of a law made by the parliament or a law made by the state legislature is not a correct approach. the entries merely being the subject head of the legislation and the power to make law having emanated from article if a particular law made by parliament comes within the legislative competence of the parliament with reference to any of the entries in $$$ i then the state legislature would not have the competence to make law with respect to that subject with reference to some other entries in $$$ ii. it is of course true that courts while examining the competing legislations would make an attempt and see whether both the legislations could operate and that question we will deal later. but the contention that entries and of $$$ ii not being subject to any entry under $$$ i and the market committee act being relatable to entries and of $$$ ii the same should be allowed to operate notwithstanding the wide meaning to the word industry in entry of $$$ i and the parliament has already taken over the control of the industry and has made law in that respect can not be sustained. in the context of our conclusions on the question of he import and extent of expression industry in entry of list i it is not necessary to examine the other contentions of dr. $$$ that whether the theory of occupied field is relevant only in case of law made with reference to entries in list. we are also not persuaded to agree with the submission of dr. $$$ that the market committee act can still be operative and the market fee could be levied by the market committee under the state act for services provided by it on the principle of quid pro quo even if the court comes to the conclusion that the tobacco board act is a valid piece of legislation enacted by the parliament and that act also has made necessary provision of r growing of tobacco as well as purchase and sale of tobacco. we are also unable to sustain the argument of mr. sanghi learned senior counsel appearing for $$$ in the madhya pradesh batch of appeals that the enquiry in the case should be whether the state legislature had the legislative competence to enact the market committee act under of list ii. his other submission on the question that there is no irreconcilable clash between the acts and the meaning of section of tobacco board act will be considered while considering the different provisions of the acts. mr. ganguli learned senior counsel appearing for the tamil nadu agricultural marketing board also submitted in the same manner as dr. $$$ and relied upon article of the constitution. but in our considered opinion article itself being notwithstanding anything in clauses and of the said article the submission of mr. ganguli is devoid of any force. the elaborate submissions of mr. ganguli in relation to the decisions of this court in baij nath kedia m.a. tulloch india cement and $$$ all of which dealt with mining legislations are not necessary to be dealt with inasmuch as we have not relied upon the principles enunciated in those decisions even though mr. shanti bhushan pressed those decisions in support of his contention. in the aforesaid premises we are of the considered opinion that the tobacco board act enacted by the parliament under entry of list i is constitutionally valid and all the provisions therein including the provisions relating to growing of tobacco and sale and purchase of tobacco are within the legislative competence of the parliament. we are also further of the opinion that the word industry in entry of list i can not be given a restricted meaning particularly when a conspectus of all the decisions interfering entry in any of the lists of the constitution including he minority view of mukherjee j. in itc case is to the effect that the entries in the list should be given liberal and generous construction and it is well accepted cardinal rule of interpretation that the words in constitutional document conferring legislative powers should be construed most liberally and in their widest amplitude. coming to the question it is no doubt true as a matter of principle of construction that in the event there are competing legislations by the parliament and by the state the court would make an endeavour if both the legislations could be allowed to be operated upon. but on examining the provisions of the acts if it is found that the central legislation and the state legislation come in collision with each then question of allowing both of them to operate would not arise. in such an event the central legislation would prevail provided the said legislation is otherwise constitutionally valid namely the parliament had the legislative competence to enact the legislation in question. from the aforesaid stand point if we examine the different provisions of the tobacco board act more particularly sections and and the provisions of the agricultural produce markets act more particularly section thereof as well as section which is said to be the heart and soul of the markets act in belsund 's case the conclusion is irresistible that the acts come in direct collision with each other and it is difficult to reconcile the provisions of both the acts. necessarily therefore the tobacco board act having been enacted by the parliament and making all provisions in relation to the tobacco industry including the provisions for growing of tobacco as well as sale and purchase of raw tobacco in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the said act the provisions of the agricultural produce markets act entitling the market committee to levy fee for sale and purchase of raw tobacco within the market area will not be operative so far as the produce tobacco is concerned. in other words central act would prevail and would govern the entire gamut of tobacco industry. it is also important to bear in mind that when parliament decides to take over the control of a particular industry in the interest of the said industry as well as in the national interest the control should be effective and should be in such a manner that the desired object can be achieved. necessarily therefore legislation ought to be made providing control over the growing of tobacco as well as on its sale and purchase which alone would subserve the very purpose for which the control of the industry has been taken over by the parliament. in this view of the matter we hold that the tobacco board act and the agricultural produce markets act collide with each other and can not be allowed to be operated simultaneously. necessarily therefore the tobacco board act would prevail and the agricultural produce markets act so far as it relates to levy of fee for sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area must be held to go out of the purview of the said act. coming to the question posed by us in view of the inconsistency and repugnancy between the acts as already stated it is the central act that would prevail and in our opinion the majority judgment in the itc case has been correctly decided though the reasons for the same given by us may be slightly different than the reasons which persuaded the learned judges to have the conclusion in the itc case. in view of our conclusion on the issues the impugned judgment of the patna high court remitting the matter to the market committee for passing a fresh assessment order is set aside and it is held that the sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area of any market committee would not be subjected to the provisions of the bihar agricultural produce markets act. civil appeal no. of is accordingly allowed. civil appeal no. of filed by the krishi utpadan mandi samiti against the division bench judgment of allahabad high court stands dismissed. we also set aside the full bench decision of the allahabad high court and the appeal filed by the tobacco merchant 's association assailing the legality of the full bench decision of the allahabad high court is allowed. similarly the judgment of the division bench of the high court of madras which follows the majority view of this court in itc case is upheld and the appeals filed by the state of tamil nadu as well as the tamil nadu agricultural marketing board are dismissed. civil writ petition filed by the jayalakshmi tobacco company under article registered as civil writ petition no. of challenging the validity of the provisions of karnataka agricultural produce marketing regulation act stands disposed of and the said act enacted by the state legislation of karnataka must be held to be invalid so far as the provisions authorising levy of fee on sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area is concerned. the appeals filed against the judgment of madhya pradesh high court are dismissed and the judgment of the division bench of madhya pradesh high court is upheld. in different appeals arising out of the judgment of the madhya pradesh high court interim stay had been granted by different $$$ on...and.. by these orders the court had stayed the operation of the judgment without any condition. all these orders stood modified by order dated.when the court passed the following order...there will no recovery of arrears due. there will also be no stay of the refund collected if any. the amount collected may be refunded within months from this date. in future there will be no stay of recovery of market -fee found due and payable from the date of the high court 's judgment. it is however made clear that if the parties have filed objection against the levy the objection shall be disposed of in accordance with law before the recovery is restored. in case ultimately if the respondents succeed then the amount collected will be refunded by the appellants along with the interest @ % per annum. in case the appellants succeed then the respondents undertaken to pay the arrears of market -fee along with the interest @ % per annum from the date of the payment. now that the judgment of the high court is being upheld and the appeals are being dismissed the question for consideration would be as to whether the said order of stay dated.should be modified or the order should be allowed to operate and the collected market -fee would be sic to be refunded with interest @ % per annum in accordance with the order dated.. having regard to the facts and circumstances and the resources of the market committee we think it appropriate to modify the said order dated.and direct that the market -fee already collected from the sale and purchase of tobacco within the market area by $$$ need not be refunded. but at the same time the market committee will not be entitled to collect the same even for $$$$ if the same has not already been collected.
