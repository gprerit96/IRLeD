this court expressed its anguish as under:4. it is deeply regrettable that in our country often litigations between the landlord and the tenant are fought up to the stage of the supreme court and when the tenant loses in this court then he starts a innings through someone claiming to be a co -tenant or as a sub -tenant or in some other capacity and in the round of litigation the matter remains pending for $$$$ and the landlord can not get possession despite the order of this court. the time has come that this malpractice must now be stopped effectively. in view of law laid down by this court as above and considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and conduct of respondents whereby persons in large number inducted unauthorisedly by them without any allotment order civil appeal no. of filed by the landlord deserves to be allowed and civil appeal nos. -of filed by the respondents contemnors before the single judge of the high court are liable to be dismissed. we order accordingly. we further direct the competent authority additional district magistrate city east lucknow to execute the form -d. however keeping in mind that there are several occupants inducted unauthorisedly without any allotment order on humanitarian ground they are allowed months ' time from $$$$ to vacate the premises voluntarily whereafter they or anyone occupying in their place along with respondent nos. to in civil appeal no. of shall be forcibly dispossessed within hours in compliance of this order as directed above. the district magistrate and the senior superintendent of police lucknow are directed to provide every assistance in execution of the order of release affirmed by the high court in writ petition r / c no. of on.. needless to say that this court has already dismissed special leave petition c nos. -of on.challenging the order passed in the writ petition by the high court. we also clarify that the landlords are not allowed to let out the released building in the existing condition and they shall demolish the building for reconstruction for which the building has been released by the authority concerned. with the directions as above civil appeal no. of is allowed and civil appeal nos. -of stand dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs.
