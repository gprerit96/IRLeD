$$$ j. this court by its judgment in union of india and ors. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc hereinafter $$$ approved a policy with some modification framed by government of india for the registration of private tour operators $$$s for haj hereafter referred to as approved policy. this court opined that such a policy avoids creation of any monopoly and makes provision for entry of fresh players. the modified and approved policy is appended to the judgment as appendix-'i'. it can be seen from the said judgment that though the policy as framed by the government of india was meant only for year i. for $$$ this court directed that it would be the policy for private tour operators for $$$ -for $$$$. under the approved policy the $$$s were categorised into groups. category -i consists of $$$s who were registered with the ministry of external affairs and facilitated $$$is at least for or more $$$$ by conducting $$$ tour operations. the category consists of classes of $$$s. $$$ -i consists of $$$s who had facilitated $$$is for less than $$$$ and $$$ -$$$ consists of the $$$s who had facilitated at least umrah pilgrims in $$$$ for any $$$$. obviously the requisite experience for a $$$ to be categorized in of the abovementid categories must be anterior to $$$. it is to be noticed that though the approved policy stipulated experience of conducting a $$$ operation for $$$$ for category -i and $$$$ experience of conducting umrah operation in class of category -$$$ the $$$ did not stipulate that $$$$ should be consecutive $$$$ or that they should be the immediate past $$$$ or $$$$ as the case may be. the consequences of classification are also specified in para of the scheme;. % of the overall quota of seats will be allocated to eligible $$$s under category and % to eligible $$$s under category. distribution of seats among qualified $$$s will be d as follows:(a % of the $$$ $$$ seats will be allocated to eligible $$$s under category at the rate of seats per $$$. in case the number of $$$s exceeds the allocation of seats will be d on draw of lots. if the number of qualified $$$s is less than each $$$ will be allocated seats and surplus seats if any will be distributed equally among them.% of $$$ $$$ seats will be allocated to eligible $$$s under category at the rate of seats per qualified $$$. if the number of qualified $$$s exceeds the allocation of seats will be d by draw of lots. in case the number of $$$s is less than each $$$ will be allocated seats. balance seats if any will be transferred to category i and distributed equally among them. a qualified $$$ which fails to get selected under the draw of lots in $$$$ will be allocated seats in the ensuing year without qurrah if it remains a qualified $$$. there is no separate scheme or statute regulating the $$$s conducting umrah operations. however we are informed by the learned additional solicitor general that the government of saudi arabia would not permit any pilgrim for umrah through a $$$ unless such $$$ has a contract with of the agencies authorized by the government of saudi arabia for the purpose. we are informed that as of $$$$ there are some such agencies in saudi arabia. we are informed at the bar by the learned additional solicitor general that existence of such a restriction emanates from the law of saudi arabia and the government of india 's knowledge of such restriction is based on the information provided by the diplomatic mission of the government of india at saudi arabia. there are annexures to the above scheme. annexure -a specifies the conditions required to be satisfied by a pto and prescribes the documents which are required to be produced to establish the facts necessary to prove that the pto satisfies the conditions for registration of private tour operators $$$ $$$. for the purpose of the present controversy we are concerned with only stipulations and vii which read as follows:(iv minimum $$$$ turnover of inr crore during the financial year -or -along with balance sheet and profit and loss account -duly audited by the statutory auditors tax audit report and income tax return itr for financial $$$$ -and -.vii proof of payment made through banking or other authorised channels towards purchase of tickets and hiring of accommodation in makkah / madinah. payments towards purchase of tickets hiring of accommodation for pilgrims in makkah / madinah by any other means would not be accepted. this batch of writ petitions are filed by the ptos falling either under category -i or of the classes of category -$$$. we take writ petitions as representative cases of the entire batch i. $$$ c no. of $$$ c no. of and $$$ c no. of. the $$$ in $$$ c no. of claims to be a pto who is duly registered with the ministry of external affairs and was allotted a quota of $$$is for $$$$ to and also in the year in all $$$$. the $$$ in $$$(c no. of claims to be a registered pto since to and also for the year but it is not very clear from the writ petition whether $$$ was allotted any quota in any of $$$$ except a vague statement at para.of the writ petition. coming to $$$ c no. of the $$$ apparently belongs to $$$ of the category -$$$ i. somebody who claims experience of having conducted umrah programme for $$$$ and seeks registration for conducting $$$ programme for the year. the prayers in these writ petitions insofar as they are relevant read as follows prayer in $$$ c no. of issue a writ order or direction in the nature of $$$ and directing the respondents restore paragraph of press release dated.by withdrawing para of para of press release dated.issue a writ order or direction in the nature of $$$ and directing the respondents to exempt the $$$ to furnish documents required under $$$ vii xi & xii of annexure a of the pto policy for $$$-$$$$ and $$$-.prayer in $$$ civil no. of issue a writ order or direction in the nature of $$$ and directing the respondent to grant registration to the $$$ as $$$ conducting $$$ insofar as the $$$ i. writ petition c no. of is concerned the relevant prayers are prayers a and c. $$$ a and are similar prayers to the prayer in the writ petition c no. of and prayer c is as follows:(c issue a writ direction or order in the nature of $$$ commanding and directing the respondent not to seek copy of contract which the respondent has sought vide paragraph of press release dated.as per annexure p-. the background in which the present litigation arises is as follows the ministry of external affairs mea issued a clarification dated th may by which a pto seeking registration for consideration of allotment of quota for $$$ programme is required to furnish documents;as regards $$$ vii of annexure a to pto $$$ policy it is clarified that the ptos will have to submit the documents required under $$$ vii of annexure a to pto $$$ policy for a period of at least $$$$. some of the ptos challenged the said document on the ground that such a clarification was unwarranted and does not find any support from the text of stipulation no. vii. their case is that in view of the fact that stipulation no. of annexure a prescribes a condition that a pto seeking registration should have a minimum $$$$ turnover of rs. crore during the financial year -or -and calls upon the ptos to submit balance sheet and profit and loss account duly audited and other documents specified therein for the abovementid financial $$$$ stipulation no. vii also must be understood in the light of stipulation no. and resultantly the pto is obligated to furnish the documents referred to therein only for $$$$. this court accepted the submission of the $$$ in $$$ & jeddah $$$j group v. union of india and directed that the case of the $$$ be considered in accordance with the decision of this court. $$$ a number of press releases came to be issued significant of them are on...and.. mea issued another press release dated.. from the said press note it appears that number of ptos who approached this court challenging the mea 's clarification dated.was. further in purported compliance with the direction of this court given in $$$ supra government examined and found more ptos under category -i and under category -$$$ to have been qualified for registration for $$$ apart from various other ptos who had otherwise been found qualified. it appears from the said press note that a total number of ptos under category -i and under category -$$$ were found to have been qualified for registration for $$$. it is stated in the said press note as follows:. this policy will remain valid from to for registration purpose for the new private tour operators who wish to be registered with the ministry on the basis of $$$ pilgrims taken by them as per details mentid in $$$ above. the policy will not be changed unless there are substantive developments which affect it. the policy envisages cross category upward movement of ptos from category -$$$ to category -i. a qualified pto shall remain qualified for registration purpose till $$$- unless it is otherwise disqualified either by government of india or by government of saudi arabia for valid reasons. the allocation of seats to the ptos qualified for registration in each category will be d $$$$ on the basis of the overall quota of seats for ptos specified in the $$$$ india -saudi arabia bilateral $$$ and the number of qualified ptos in each category. this court passed an order dated.in a batch of writ petitions similar to the s on hand the operative portion of which reads as follows: in the light of aforesaid discussion and keeping in view the statement made by the additional solicitor general on behalf of the respondent -union of india we dispose of these writ petitions finally by granting liberty to each writ $$$ to make a fresh application with all the necessary details with the documents as prescribed for grant of permission to take the pilgrims for $$$ for the year on or before.to the prescribed authority.on such application s being made the concerned authority would examine consider and decide each such application on its merit strictly in accordance with law and keeping in view the law laid down in the decisions of this court in union of india and ors. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc order dated.passed in special leave petition c no. entitled union of india and ors. v. all india $$$ $$$ tour organizers association and ors.order dated.passed in writ petition civil no. 0/ etc. etc. entitled $$$ & jeddah $$$j group v. union of india order dated.passed in i.a. no. of in special leave petition c no. entitled union of india v. $$$ bhikan and ors. and order dated.in w.p. civil no. / entitled alban $$$j $$$ service v. union of india.let the applications be decided by the concerned authority by passing a reasd order on each application on or before.and the order so passed be communicated to each applicant writ $$$ immediately. we are of the opinion that it is not necessary to examine in detail the content of these various press releases issued by the mea. they only indicate the government of india 's understanding of the approved policy as interpreted by orders of this court in $$$ supra. these press notes are professedly meant to be clarificatory of the approved policy. but they created more confusion than really clarifying the approved policy. the net result emerging from these various press notes and the orders of this court is that as a matter of fact some of the ptos falling under either category i or $$$ who should have been registered by the ministry of external affairs for consideration of their cases for allotment of $$$ quota for the year were wrongly denied registration and therefore they were not allotted any quota in $$$$. the ultimate question in this batch of matters is -what are the documents which are required to be submitted for registration as a pto qualified for being considered for allotment of quota for $$$. there is no dispute between the parties regarding the obligation of a pto to furnish various documents referred to in various stipulations of annexure a of the approved policy. the dispute revolves only around the stipulation vii. it is the common understanding of the government of india and petitirs / ptos insofar as stipulation no. is concerned though the text of the stipulation speaks about submission of balance sheet and profit and loss account for $$$$ -and -that stipulation is to be understood as the balance sheet and profit and loss account pertaining to $$$$ -and -for the purpose of registration for the haj. on the only contentious stipulation that is stipulation no. vii according to the government of india when the approved policy imposes an obligation on a pto seeking registration to produce proof of the payments made through banking or other authorized channels towards purchase of tickets and hiring of accommodation in makkah / madinah obviously such an obligation is with reference to $$$$ preceding haj in view of the orders of this court in $$$ supra. the learned addtl. solicitor general submitted that they are not only bound by the orders of this court in $$$ supra and $$$ supra but also are under a constitutional duty to be satisfied that an applicant $$$ registration for $$$ programme has the necessary ability and capacity financial and infrastructural to conduct such a programme because the safety and comfort of the $$$ pilgrims eventually depends upon the ability and the capacity of the ptos. it is submitted that some of the ptos did not in the past really provide the necessary services which they ought to have provided to the pilgrims. past performance of the ptos is of the factors by which the government of india makes an assessment of the capacity of the ptos under the approved policy. the past performance of a pto is to be assessed on the basis of the documentary evidence indicated in stipulation no. vii. such evidence proves the facts that ptos after having secured the allotment of quota did in fact conduct $$$ programme by actually purchasing tickets and providing appropriate accommodation for the pilgrims in makkah / madinah. therefore any pto seeking consideration for allotment of a quota for $$$ must necessarily supply the documents for $$$$ of and $$$. on the other hand the learned counsel for the petitirs argued that some of the petitirs who were otherwise eligible to be considered for allotment of quota for $$$ were wrongly denied registration and consequently they did not get any quota. therefore calling upon them to produce proof of the fact that they had made appropriate arrangement for $$$$ is not only illogical but would be asking them to perform an impossibility apart from being an arbitrary exercise of power. therefore their cases must be considered without insisting upon the documents for $$$$ -and -. in our opinion stipulation no. vii does not impose a substantive obligation on a pto seeking consideration for allotment of quota by the government of india for $$$ programme of $$$$. it only incorporates a rule of evidence to establish the fact whether a particular pto had in fact conducted $$$ programme in the past. ptos had been in existence and conducting $$$ operations without any intervention by the government of india even prior to the coming into existence of the approved policy under the orders of this court in $$$ supra. it is a different matter as to how well they had conducted the $$$ programmes. sometime in after the government of saudi arabia decided that only those ptos which are approved by the government of india could be given group visas to perform $$$ operations this whole process of the government of india considering allotment of quota to ptos started because the government is under a constitutional obligation to consider the cases of all the eligible ptos without discrimination. to decide upon the eligibility of ptos certain criteria was required. therefore the approved policy stipulated that those ptos who had conducted at least $$$ operations or more would be considered in category -i and ptos who had conducted less than $$$ operations would be treated as category -ii ptos. the consequence of the division of ptos into categories is that the total number of visas to be provided by the government of saudi arabia for the pilgrims going through ptos would be distributed among the categories in the ratio indicated in para which is already taken note of. ptos which had conducted greater number of $$$ programmes would get a larger chunk of visas. to determine whether a particular pto falls either under category -i or category -ii some evidence to establish the number of tours conducted by such a pto prior to the formation of the scheme is required. the best proof as rightly identified by the government in stipulation no. vii of annexure a is the evidence of payments for the air tickets and hiring of accommodation through banking or other authorized channels. we must note it here that stipulation vii is relevant only for those ptos who are seeking registration either under category i or category ii as ptos eligible for consideration for allotment of quotas for $$$ for the time. when an application is received from any $$$ the time as was rightly contended by the learned additional solicitor general before this court in the jeddah travels supra the proof by documents specified in stipulation vii is required. unfortunately the said submission was rejected by this court. with respect we may say that we are unable to agree with the conclusion of this court in jeddah travels supra in this regard. be that as it may but once the pto is registered either under category i or category ii insisting upon the pto to produce proof for $$$$ or to produce documents contemplated under stipulation vii in our opinion is not supported either by the text of the approved policy or logic. the scheme was not confined only to $$$ and made applicable till by orders of this court. there is always a possibility of some new ptos who were qualified to fall under category -ii in to acquire a qualification to fall in category -i in $$$$. for example a pto who successfully conducted $$$ operations prior to would fall under category -ii for the purpose of allotment of quota in $$$. if it did in fact secure a quota for $$$ and did in fact conduct $$$ operations for successfully for a $$$ operation for any subsequent year during the currency of the approved policy a pto would be entitled to be considered as a category -i pto as by then it had conducted $$$ operations. similarly the ptos who facilitated umrah pilgrims in $$$$ for $$$$s prior to would be eligible for being considered in category -ii and for allotment of quota of $$$ and if it is successful in securing the quota and in conducting $$$ operations in $$$$ it would be entitled to be considered for quota under $$$ -i of category -ii as a pto who has conducted $$$ operation. we have already noticed the relevant portion of the approved policy which dealt with the categorization of the ptos. the approved policy did not stipulate a condition that experience of having conducted $$$ programmes is an experience of consecutive $$$$ etc. therefore if a pto is once registered in any of $$$$ either as a category -i or category -ii pto to call upon such ptos to furnish the documents contemplated under stipulation no. vii for $$$$ in our opinion would not be in tune with the text of the approved policy. we are conscious of the fact that some ptos who had successfully undertaken a number of $$$ programmes may subsequently derelict their responsibility to the pilgrims. the government of india has ample power under the approved policy to deregister such ptos. this aspect is amply born out of the text of the policy itself. para of the policy insofar as it is relevant reads as follows:..the policy envisages cross -category upward movement of ptos from category to category i. a qualified pto shall remain qualified unless it is otherwise disqualified either by the government of india or by the government of saudi arabia for valid reasons. it is to be noted that the ptos who do not wish to take a minimum of $$$is or are unable to do so need not apply. therefore in our opinion understanding of the government of india that even those ptos who had been registered either in category -i or category -ii would also be required to furnish the documents specified in stipulation no. vii $$$$ when they are seeking consideration for allotment of quota of $$$ pilgrims is wholly illogical and contrary to the text of the approved policy. a registration for pto once made under the scheme should be valid till subject to fulfillment of other relevant stipulations under the scheme. ultimately documents specified in stipulation vii not only go to prove a fact that a pto had in fact conducted a $$$ programme in $$$$ but also prove that the pto has necessary information and contacts in saudi arabia to organize an appropriate accommodation both at makkah / madinah. another submission of the learned additional solicitor general is required to be examined at this stage. the submission is that in the absence of such documents for the minimum preceding $$$$ relevant to the $$$ programme in consideration the government would have no means of assessing the continued ability and capacity of the pto to undertake a $$$ operation and therefore the government should be permitted to insist upon the production of such documents. this argument is to be rejected for reason under para of the approved policy it is stipulated that a qualified pto which fails to get selected under the draw of lots in $$$$ will be allocated seats in the ensuing year without umrah if it remains a qualified pto obviously such a pto would not be able to produce such documents with reference to $$$$ when it failed to secure allotment of quota for $$$. therefore the assessment of its ability on the basis of $$$$ performance as is sought to be argued by the learned additional solicitor general is not possible in such cases. still the government is obliged under the approved policy to grant a quota to such ptos. lastly it is argued by the learned additional solicitor general based on the decision of this court in union of india and ors. etc. v. $$$ and anr. etc. $$$ / mh//0$$$ / mh//0 scc that this court may not interfere with the policy of the government unless it is demonstrated before us that the condition(s was purely subjective or designed to exclude any individual or group of private operators / travel agents i. bordering on malice. we reject the submission as the statement relied upon by the learned additional solicitor general is not an exhaustive statement of law on the subject when it is demonstrated that the administrative action of the government of india is inconsistent with the text of the law approved policy in this case or that the government is making an irrational application of the law this court is bound to interfere. it is submitted by the learned asg that the prime consideration in this matter should not be the individual rights of these ptos whose only motive is to secure economic benefits from the allotment of $$$ quota but the safety and comfort of the $$$ pilgrims. government of india must have the necessary freedom to make its own assessment regarding the suitability of the pto in this regard. we do not dispute the proposition the text of the scheme itself makes it abundantly clear that any pto once qualified shall remain qualified unless it is otherwise disqualified.. by the government of india.. for valid reasons.therefore it is always open to the government to disqualify any registered $$$ subsequent year if there is rational complaint against the service rendered by that pto in $$$$ from any of the pilgrims of $$$$ or any other legally tenable information or material which calls for disqualification of such a pto. we are left with the writ petitions of those ptos who are seeking consideration for allotment of quota for haj in the category -ii class i. their claim is that earlier that is in for the year they were allotted a quota on the ground that they were ptos falling under class -ii of category -ii i. ptos which had the experience of having conducted umrah operations prior to. the learned additional solicitor general submitted that under the laws of saudi arabia ptos are not permitted to conduct umrah operations unless they have a clear contract with of the agencies duly authorised by government of saudi arabia for the purpose of conducting umrah operations and some of these ptos did not have any such contract. according to the learned asg the $$$ ptos were only sub -contractors under some ptos which were already classified as ptos falling under category -i or class -i of category -ii. they did not have any independent contract for conducting umrah operations however by some oversight some of them had been granted registration and quota under class -i of category -ii for the year. the learned asg submitted that it does not create any right in favour of such ptos. whatever be the basis on which quota was allotted to these ptos for haj the fact remains that if anyone of those ptos did in fact conduct a haj programme pursuant to the quota they would be entitled for being considered even for unless there is any other good ground for not considering their cases such as inefficient or bad service rendered to the pilgrimage during haj programme their claims now can not be rejected. if the respondent decides to de -register such ptos on any ground tenable in law it is open for the respondent to de -register after giving reasonable opportunity to such ptos but until such de -registration takes place their cases must be considered for allotment of quota for haj if they are otherwise eligible. it is a settled principle of international law that a law of a foreign country is a pure question of fact insofar as municipal courts are concerned we do not see any reason to doubt the statement the government of india and therefore we do not see any reason to grant any relief for those ptos. all these writ petitions are disposed of directing the respondents to consider the cases of all the ptos for allotment of quota in the light of these orders insofar as stipulation vii of annexure a is concerned subject to the fact that ptos are otherwise eligible in accordance with the approved scheme.$$$ no. 559/$$$$taken on board.in view of the order passed in w.p.c no. 5/$$$$ this petition also stands disposed of. having heard the attorney general and the counsel appearing for the different private tour operators we approve the policy presented by the attorney general with some slight modifications. the policy approved after modifications by this court is enclosed as appendix i and forms part of this order. the approved policy will be called policy for private tour operators for $$$ -. it shall remain valid for $$$$ and shall not be questioned before any court or authority.pto should establish that it is a genuine and established tour operator having experience in sending tourists / pilgrims abroad for which he should produce the following documents.-that on.the respondent after scrutinizing the application submitted by the $$$ selected the $$$ as a pto for $$$j and the certificate of registration of private tour operators for $$$j was issued by the respondent to the $$$. the $$$ conducted service for hajj without any complaint.scc para hereinafter jeddah travels. $$$ vii of annexure a referred to above not having stipulated any period of time during which the requirement contemplated thereunder is required to be satisfied by a private tour operator and $$$ which relates to the turnover of a tour operator being confined to a period of year out of the available calendar $$$$ mentioned thereunder and both the clauses being relatable to a determination of the suitability of a tour operator from a similar perspective the requirement under $$$ vii can be reasonably understood in the light of what is contained in $$$ i. financial years -or -. admittedly the private tour operators before us have been disqualified by taking into account periods of time other than what is mentioned above. that apart if the government of india was of the view that $$$ vii had to be understood with reference to a period of years really this court ought to have been approached for an appropriate clarification. the lists of the ptos under category i & ii who were qualified for $$$-$$$$ may be seen at annexure i ii & of the press releases of.and.available at the ministry 's website www.mea.gov.in link $$$ press release for ptos for $$$ dated.list of ptos qualified for allocation of quota for $$$ dated.and iii list of qualified ptos who did not get quota for $$$ due to draw of lots dated.. the ptos who still remain eligible as per this list may apply for registration for $$$ as per the laid down guidelines further in compliance of hon'ble supreme court order on the writ petition no. /$$$$ dated.ptos as per enclosed list at annexure -x may also apply for registration following the laid down guidelines. these lists are subject to any further order / directions of hon'ble supreme court. all the terms and conditions laid down in annexure a & b will also apply on ptos that qualify under category -ii by virtue of facilitating a minimum of $$$ pilgrims in $$$$ for any years but with the exception of the terms and conditions contained under $$$ vii xi and xii of annexure a. in addition these ptos are also required to submit the proof of payment made through banking or any other authorised channels towards purchase of tickets and hiring of accommodation in makkah and madinah in respect of $$$ pilgrims facilitated by them in support of their claim. the ptos who have been qualified for registration for $$$-5 is enclosed at annex -a.para. in addition the hon'ble supreme court vide its judgment dated 7th august in the writ petitions filed by ptos has directed the ministry that clause vii of annexure a of the ptos policy should be read with clause. the hon'ble court directed the ministry to do self -correction in this regard. therefore the documents of the non -qualified ptos for minimum $$$$ turnover of rs. crore or above and purchase of air tickets and hiring of accommodation for $$$ pilgrims through banking or other authorised channels for the year -$$$ or -$$$ needed to be re -verified in addition to other documents as indicated in annexure a and b of the ptos policy.para. in order to comply the directions of the hon'ble supreme court the documents of those ptos who were given opportunity for personal hearing but were not considered qualified during have been re -verified with the assistance of the chartered accountant firm m / s s.p. chopra & co hired through bidding process. the documents like annual turnover of rs. crore or more minimum capital of rs. lakh and documents regarding transaction through proper banking channel for purchase of air tickets for the $$$ pilgrims and hiring of accommodation for them in makkah / madinah pertaining to the year -or -$$$ of the ptos were verified. as a result more ptos under category -i and under category -ii have been qualified for registration for $$$. a list of the ptos qualified for registration after re -verification of the documents is enclosed at annexure b. thus a total of ptos under category -i and under category -ii have been qualified for registration for $$$.of india and ors. etc. v. $$$ and anr. etc. $$$ / mh/1222/2011$$$ / mh/1222/2011 scc. in this judgment the following paragraphs are to be noted-5. in order to clearly understand the context in which the dispute arises a few facts are required to be taken into account. under a bilateral agreement signed between the government of india and the kingdom of saudi arabia $$$$ the latter government assigns a fixed number of pilgrims that are permitted to visit saudi arabia for performing $$$. out of the overall number a relatively small portion is specified for the ptos and the rest for the $$$ committee of india. before the ptos were allocated $$$ seats directly by the kingdom of saudi arabia and there was therefore no involvement of the government of india in the allocation of any $$$ quota to the ptos. after $$$ the kingdom of saudi arabia made it mandatory for the ptos to come through their respective governments. from therefore the government of india was obliged to evolve a system under which private operators / travel agents would be registered as ptos and following the registration would be allocated quotas from the overall number of pilgrims specified for ptos. it is thus to be seen that a private operator / travel agent needs first to get registered as pto and it would then get a fixed number of pilgrims for carrying for $$$. $$$ learned additional solicitor general has vehemently contended that the requirement under the order of the court dated --f / n union of india v. $$$ bhikan manu / sc/0382/$$$$manu / sc/0382/$$$$ scc is really for a year period which is evident from a reading of appendix i which is to be found in para of the aforesaid order of this court.
