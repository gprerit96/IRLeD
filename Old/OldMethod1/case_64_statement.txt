$$$ wife of $$$ and the appeal insofar as other $$$s are concerned is not being pressed and the appeal qua those $$$s stands dismissed as such. according to the prosecution the incident which occurred on 0th june has genesis in rival claims set up in respect of agricultural land khasra no. and of village dassusar of $$$ in district churu rajasthan. this land originally belonged to $$$ who died issueless leaving behind his widow $$$. $$$ claimed to have been adopted by said $$$. the fact of adoption was being denied by the said $$$. $$$ sold this land in dispute to $$$ and $$$ by registered sale deed and according to her she had delivered possession to the purchasers. the aforesaid sale by $$$ was challenged by $$$ by filing a civil suit in the court of the sub -divisional magistrate ratangarh in which an interim order was passed on november restraining the purchasers from interfering with the possession of the land in question. it further appears that $$$ had filed a counter suit. in this scenario when both the parties had filed civil litigation claiming the right to and possession of the land in question the incident on 0th june occurred. according to the prosecution in the morning of 0th june the accused party came on a camel cart and finding that the complainant party was ploughing the agricultural land members of the accused party exhorted that they be taught a lesson. in the fight that ensued thereafter persons from the complainant side namely $$$ $$$ narayana tiku and gordhan sustained various injuries and succumbed to their injuries. additionally witnesses namely p.w. $$$ p.w. $$$ p.w. $$$ p.w. -girdhari ram and p.w.  ram also suffered injuries. according to the prosecution all accused persons were variously armed and had come to the agricultural land in question by forming an unlawful assembly. the reporting of the incident was made by p.w. $$$ at a. at government hospital ratangarh pursuant to which the crime in question namely fir no. of was registered. a cross case was also registered at the instance of the accused party who contended that it was in fact the complainant party who had come to the field in question to dispossess them. it may be noted that some of the accused persons had also suffered injuries in that transaction which injury reports are available at exhibits d0 to d and insofar as the $$$ herein is concerned the injury report exhibit d- shows that she had suffered a punctured wound though described as simple. the post -mortem report in respect of $$$ exhibit p77 shows that he suffered injuries out of which -and -were caused by a blunt weapon while injuries -were caused by a sharp -edged weapon and that he died due to the said injuries. the post -mortem report exhibit p7 shows that $$$ had suffered injuries caused by blunt weapon sharp -edged weapon piercing object and that he suffered fractures and damage to liver. the post -mortem report exhibit p7 in respect of gordhan reveals that he sustained punctured wounds on vital parts lacerated wounds and abrasion and that he died due to injury to his vital organ namely left lung. post -mortem report exhibit p0 shows that $$$ suffered injuries including incised wounds fractures piercing wounds crushed wounds and abrasions including injuries to his lungs. lastly the post -mortem exhibit p1 shows that deceased $$$ suffered injuries inflicted by blunt weapons sharp -edged weapons and piercing object resulting in his death. these post -mortem report were proved by p.w. dr. $$$. the eye witness account given by p.ws. and specifically shows the presence of the $$$. the eye witness account further shows that she was armed with a weapon namely lathi. it is true that none of the witnesses have specifically alleged any role to the $$$ in causing any injury to any of the deceased. the trial court after considering the material on record by its judgment dated 1th november convicted and sentenced accused as mentioned hereinabove. according to the trial court p.ws. and being interested witnesses could not be relied upon. the trial court however found the case against accused persons being proved by the prosecution. the fact that the accused had suffered injuries in the transaction according to the trial court fully established their presence. the trial court found that the agricultural land in question was actually in possession of the accused party and thus acquitted the accused of the charges under section$$$$$$$$7 indian penal code. however the trial court recorded that the accused had completely exceeded their right of private defence and as such were guilty of the offences as alleged. the high court has confirmed the conviction and sentence as recorded by the trial court. mr. v.j. $$$ learned advocate appearing for $$$ submitted that the trial court having not relied upon the version of p.ws. and there being no specific allegation against the $$$ the possession of the disputed land having been found with the accused and they having been acquitted under section indian penal code the conviction and sentence as recorded against the $$$ was completely erroneous. it was further submitted that the incident in question was a case of free fight and there was no room to conclude that the $$$ was an active participant in the transaction so as to warrant her conviction with the aid of section indian penal code. the learned advocate appearing for the state however submitted that the presence and participation of the $$$ was proved beyond any doubt and the fact that all persons had come prepared to open an assault actually shows the satisfaction of the ingredients under section indian penal code. we have considered the matter and the rival submissions. the fact that the $$$ was present at the time of occurrence has not been seriously disputed or questioned. her presence is spoken to by pws. and who say that she was present and was also armed with a lathi. exhibit d19 the injury report further establishes the presence of the $$$. it is true that as affirmed by the trial court the land in question was actually in possession of the accused and as such it was pleased to acquit the accused of the charges under section indian penal code. however that would not in any manner justify the assault and the intensity in which persons lost their lives. the finding that the accused exceeded the right of private defence and as such would be guilty of the offence with which they were charged is absolutely correct. the presence participation and the preparedness on part of the accused stands fully established. being member of the unlawful assembly which openly assaulted the $$$ is definitely guilty of the offence with which she was charged and convicted. we have seen the evidence of p.ws. and and the criticism adopted by the trial court in our view is not correct. they may be interested but that by itself does not diminish the value of their testimony. their testimony as well as that of other eyewitnesses is quite cogent and consistent and corroborated by the materials on record. we find no reason to differ from the view which has weighed with the trial court and the high court. we therefore dismiss the present appeal.
