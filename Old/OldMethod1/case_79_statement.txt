police station transferred the case to the jurisdiction police.the case was then re -registered in crime no. at rural police station and pw- located the lorry bearing registration no. cno and from the lorry he found out that it belongs to pws and and contacted them over the ph intimating them that the lorry had met with an accident near $$$ village and persons named $$$ $$$ and manjunath had received injuries in the accident and that they were being treated at wenlock hospital at $$$.j on receipt of the information pws and went to wenlock hospital and on inquiry came to know that the injured got themselves discharged against the advice of the doctor pw- and g to kmc hospital $$$. in kmc hospital they found that injured person by name $$$ was serious and was admitted in intensive care unit and unable to talk. pw- left behind pw- to get the particulars.k sometime in the evening pw- noticed that persons along with a young boy came to the kmc hospital $$$ and when the persons went to icu leaving behind the boy pw- out of curiosity made enquiry and learnt from the boy that all the persons and the juvenile were injured in the lorry which met with an accident at $$$. the boy further alleged to have revealed that he was working as a coolie and on.the accused brought him to hotel at $$$ at . when the lorry stopped at the hotel they requested the driver to take them as passengers. all of them sat in the cabin and after some distance of them got the lorry stopped on the pretext of attending calls of nature and then $$$ a- tried to strangulate the driver with a plastic rope and when the driver and the cleaner tried to run away they were hit with the wooden block called as $$$ and killed both of them. the boy further alleged to have revealed that after taking the my from the person of the driver as well as the wrist watch accused a- and other took the vehicle towards the forest in order to dispose of the dead bodies. the boy further alleged to have disclosed that when they kept the body of the driver in a culvert near jenugudde and before they could dispose of the body of the cleaner in the same way they heard the sound of approaching vehicle and they proceeded ahead in the lorry and thereafter the body of cleaner was also kept under a culvert. the boy further alleged to have disclosed that thereafter the lorry was driven to the estate of rajegowda pw- and after unloading the fertilizer bags while they were proceeding towards $$$ the lorry met with an accident and all of them got injured. this is how the accused were roped in with the crime by the circumstances as recited above. after the accused were arrested they were interrogated. accused nos. and made the voluntary disclosure statements vide $$$. p.and leading to the discovery and seizure of bags of fertilizer from the estate of pw-3 rajegowda and the wrist watch belonging to the deceased $$$ from pw-$$$$ the taxi driver. the disclosure statement led to the recovery of wooden $$$. mo-0 alleged to have been used by the accused for the murder of deceased $$$ and deceased $$$. in course of the trial accused no. manjunath is stated to be a juvenile offender and his case was split up and only accused were tried in sessions case. to establish the guilt of the accused the prosecution has examined as many as pws to $$$s. p.to p.and m.os. to. in their examination under section i.p.c.the accused totally denied the prosecution story. they however declined to lead any dws. it is contended by mr. $$$ learned amicus curiae that the prosecution case rests entirely on the circumstantial evidence and the prosecution in such a case is required to prove all the links in the chain of circumstances which would lead to unerringly conclusion and that is the guilt of the accused. according to him the chain of circumstances linking to the guilt of the accused has not been discharged by the prosecution. as already noticed there is a concurrent finding of facts by both the courts and this court would be slow to interfere with the concurrent finding of facts unless there is some perversity in the finding. it is also established principle of law that in a case resting on circumstantial evidence the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn must unerringly lead to conclusion consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. keeping in view this principle we now to proceed to find out whether the finding arrived at by the courts suffers from any infirmity. before we advert further we may point out that all the prosecution witnesses were independent witnesses and there is no allegation of malice or rancour towards the accused. the witnesses were also subjected to lengthy cross -examination but their testimony remained unimpeached. it is not disputed that on.the lorry bearing no. cno loaded with $$$ urea bags driven by deceased $$$ accompanied by cleaner deceased $$$ left $$$ towards balehonnur. the said lorry belongs to pws and of kiran transport company. the said lorry met with an accident near $$$ when the accused were injured in the same accident. this is borne out from the witnesses of pws and who are the persons who were immediately approached by the accused after the accident and their help was sought to go to hospital. the evidence of pws and has also been corroborated by the evidence of medical officers p.ws. and. it is the evidence of pw-7 $$$ a group d ' employee of health unit at $$$ that on.all the accused along with a boy came to health unit and informed him that they had sustained injuries in an accident to the lorry in which they were travelling. as there was no medical officer available he directed the accused to approach the general hospital at . he stated that of the accused had serious injury on his head. the statement of pw-7 is corroborated by the evidence of pws and. as noticed pw-7 was a d class employee of phu $$$ and residing near the place of accident it is quite natural that the accused would go to the nearest place where medical aid is available. further the evidence of pw-7 is corroborated by the evidence of pw who is a coffee estate owner of $$$ village. it is in the statement of pw-7 that in at about.a. on.accused nos. to came to his estate out of whom was seriously injured and sought his help to go to hospital at $$$. it is also stated that after seeing the condition of the injured he telephd to a relative who is also proprietor of hilal coffee works at $$$ and requested him to arrange for sending a taxi to take the injured to the $$$. at about.a. a taxi came and injured were taken in taxi towards $$$. the evidence of pw- is further corroborated by the evidence of ferozkhan pw- the taxi driver. pw- stated that he is a taxi driver driving a taxi bearing registration no. mex. on receipt of communication from the proprietor of hilal coffee works that there was a ph call from $$$ stating that an accident had happened at $$$ and the injured were required to be shifted to a hospital he took the taxi went to $$$ and reached the outskirts by about.or.a. and saw some persons standing and of them was seriously injured. he took them to government hospital $$$ and received the taxi charges of rs. from them. the accused were identified by pws and. the evidence of p.w. that he took the accused from $$$ to $$$ $$$ to $$$ has been corroborated by the evidence of dr. prakash inamdar . it is stated in the evidence of that he was a medical officer in the govt. hospital at $$$ and on.he had examined injured persons who disclosed their names as $$$ / o $$$ $$$ s / o $$$ and manjunath s / o r. $$$. the accused also informed him that they were victims of a motor vehicle accident near $$$ village.  not only treated the accused but also noted down the injures in the medico legal register and the same is marked vide $$$.p-3 and the relevant entries at p-3 a b & c. it is consistent that the accused were injured in a lorry accident at $$$ village and later came to $$$ government hospital with the help of pws and. in the light of the facts recited the following circumstances are clearly established against the accused. the circumstantial evidence connecting with the accused is again the evidence of pw- the taxi driver. it is noticed in the evidence of pw-7 medical officer who had advised the accused to take the seriously injured to a major hospital at $$$. according to the prosecution case the accused again came back to the taxi stand and met pw- and asked him to take the injured to $$$ in his taxi. pw- agreed to the request on the condition that they would pay his taxi charges of rs. the charges were stated to be settled at rs. and they left towards $$$. it is in the evidence of pw- that while they were proceeding near uppinangadi some mechanical defect developed in the taxi and he asked the accused to make alternative arrangement. it is further stated that on being demand of taxi charges the accused expressed their inability to pay the whole amount and paid rs. and on being insisted by pw- for full payment a sum of rs. along with ceiko writ watch had been given stating that they would come back and take the writ watch back after or days after paying the balance amount. as already stated pw- met with all the accused persons on occasions. he was well acquainted with the accused and clearly recognised them in the court. there is no malice or ill -feeling of pw- towards the accused. he was subjected to lengthy cross examination but nothing could be elicited to discredit his testimony. the statement of pw- has also been corroborated by the seizure of mo-. this again further strengthened the prosecution story connecting the accused with the crime. pw- the employer of the deceased $$$ and pw- $$$ the younger brother of the deceased had specifically and positively identified that mo- a wrist watch belongs to the deceased $$$. pw- being the younger brother of the deceased $$$ is quite natural that he had sufficient and occasion to see the wrist watch ceiko company being worn by the deceased $$$. pw- the employer of $$$ also clearly stated that he had seen the deceased wearing mo- whenever he comes for duty. from the evidence disclosed above it is apparently clear that the accused received injures on their bodies in a lorry accident at $$$ and went from $$$ to $$$ has been well established by the prosecution. the circumstantial evidence against the accused is that they were being treated by the doctors of the injuries sustained by them in an accident involving the lorry in question. dr. vasanthkumar pw-6 has stated that he examined injured named $$$ a- brought by sunil established as $$$ from $$$ and noticed injuries on his body and recorded the wound certificate $$$.p-. according to him it was a case of injury of lorry accident. he has stated that the person accompanying the injured had given his name as sunil. this doctor in his examination -in -chief produced $$$.and stated that while attending to the injury he has noted identifiable marks on the body of the both the injured george and sunil. he has found a black mole in front of the neck of $$$ and in the court with the help of birth mark. he has identified the accused no. as the person who was brought by sunil in the injured condition. in regard to sunil he again noted the injuries on him and issued the wound certificate vide $$$.p-. he has stated before the court that he noted the identification mark on said sunil as having brown mole of below the right nipple in front of chest. this witness identified accused no. established as $$$ as the person who brought a- to the hospital and gave his name as sunil and the identification is d after seeking the birth mark in $$$.p-. identification marks of accused nos. and by pw-6 in the court with physical identifiable mark noted in $$$.and tallying with the actual birth marks in the courts clearly establish beyond any reasonable doubt that it was accused nos. and who went to the wenlock hospital in injured condition on.with the history of road accident. this apart as already noticed a- also lodged a complaint of the accident vide $$$.p-4. pw-3 b. vasudeva psi of $$$ south police station recorded the statement of a- as $$$.p- wherein he stated his name as sunil. in $$$.p- statement a- stated that on.he along with his brother -in -law a-4 travelled in a lorry towards $$$ and when the lorry came near $$$ due to rash and negligent driving of the driver at about.am the lorry capsized and the inmates received the injures and the driver and the cleaner ran away from the place. it is seen thus a- had admitted that a- and a-4 traveled in the truck and met with an accident at $$$ and both of them received injuries and they were brought to $$$ by car for treatment and from there to wenlock hospital mangalore. a- however disowned his statement and even denied of receiving any injures or there was any lorry accident in his statement under section cr.p.c. the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution connecting the accused with the guilt is the various recoveries made at the disclosure of the accused. at the time of interrogation accused nos. to made disclosure statements leading to the discovery of incriminating materials. a-3 gave a voluntary disclosure statement $$$.p-14 which led to the discovery of wrist watch m- of deceased $$$ from pw-30 the taxi driver. as already noticed $$$.m- wrist watch belongs to the deceased $$$ has been proved by pws and. the other recovery is of fertilizer from the estate of pw-13. this recovery has been made on the basis of the voluntary statement vide $$$.p-39 made by a-1. pursuant to the disclosure statement pw-34 recovered bags of $$$ urea which were found stored in the godown of pw-13. the said urea bags were carried by the deceased in the lorry from mangalore to balehonnur. pw-13 was declared hostile and did not support the prosecution story. pw-13 however admitted that a-3 serial $$$ was working as a servant in his estate. he has also admitted that around 3rd or 4th february the police party came to his estate and seized bags of fertilizer from his estate. he has also admitted that he has put his signature on the seizure panchanama $$$.p-. although pw-13 did not support the prosecution story but facts were established by the prosecution that a-3 was his servant and bags of fertilizer which did not belong to him were seized from his estate by the police on a voluntary disclosure statement made by a-3 bags which were part of bags of $$$ urea which were carried by the said lorry from mangalore to balehonnur. the seizure has been proved by the iq and the panch witness. the fertilizer bags belong to m.c.c.w. of ballehonnur has been proved by pw-8 as being purchased by the pennabur factory. the circumstantial evidence appearing against the accused is the recovery of mos. and at the instance of a-3. m-0 is the wooden katte alleged to have been used for murdering both the deceased. both the courts below did not place much reliance on mo-1 the side mirror of the lorry and sun mica piece fixed at the lorry. however both the courts relied upon m-0 the assaulting weapon. further m-0 was stained with blood and it was sent to forensic science lab and it is confirmed to have been stained with human blood. the last and probably the most formidable circumstantial evidence against the accused is their own conduct. it appears that the accused were entangled in their own cob -web. as already noticed a- lodged the complaint ex.p-45. in the complaint a- has stated that they were the occupants of the lorry which met with an accident on.near $$$ vis $$$ due to rash and negligent driving of the driver. their lorry fell down reversibly and due to the accident the complainant and his cousin $$$ suffered severe injuries and they are being treated in government hospital. on the basis of the complaint a case was registered under section ipc. in the complaint a-2 gave his name as sunil farnandis which later on proved to be false and established as $$$ as noticed earlier. there is also enough evidence on record that accused have been treated at various hospitals which is borne out from the evidence of dr. prakash inamdar p-28 and dr. vasanthkumar pw-26 and pw-29 dr. $$$ as noticed earlier. this would go to show that the accused had admitted the boarding of the lorry and the lorry met with an accident and they sustained injuries on their bodies out of the lorry accident. in their examination under section cr.pc the accused denied the prosecution story in toto. they denied that lorry accident had taken place. they also denied to have received any injuries. in short in their statement they completely denied the established facts and offered false answers. by now it is well established principle of law that in a case of circumstantial evidence where an accused offers false answer in his examination under against the established facts that can be counted as providing a missing link for completing the chain. in $$$ v. state of west bengal this court said that in a case of circumstantial evidence when the accused offers an explanation and that explanation is found not to be true then the same offers an additional link in the chain of circumstances to complete the chain. the same principle has been followed and reiterate in state of maharashtra v. $$$ / sc/0765/99manu / sc/0765/99 where it has been said that a false answer offered by the accused when his attention was drawn to a circumstance renders that circumstance capable of inculpating him. this court further pointed out that in such a situation false answer can also be counted as providing a missing link for completing the chain. the aforesaid principle has been again followed and reiterate in kuldeep singh and ors. v. state of rajasthan manu / sc/0303/00manu / sc/0303/00 . in our view therefore the chain of circumstances as recited above coupled with the law laid down by this court unerringly lead to conclusion and that is the guilt of the accused. however error has been committed by the high court by converting the conviction from section read with section i.p.c. to under section in aid of section i.p.c. it is in the evidence of $$$ castolina that the juvenile accused manjunath had disclosed to him that all the accused participated in the murder of deceased $$$ and $$$. as already noticed the trial of juvenile accused manjunath has been splitted. the trial court therefore was right in convicting the appellants under section ipc read with section ipc. in the result this appeal is dismissed being devoid of merit. we record our appreciation of mr. $$$ learned amices -curiae for his able assistance.
