are as on the basis of specific information air customs officers preventive at igi airport new delhi on.recovered and seized from meal trolleys of the aircraft of lufthansa airlines flight from

seizure of gold and named other persons involved in the incident. $$$ inter alia disclosed the name of $$$ i.the respondent herein who invested the my with him in the seized gold as well as the gold smuggled on earlier occasions.b $$$ further stated that on.$$$ and he went to dubai where the respondent delivered packets of gold that they went to frankfurt that in the flight from frankfurt to delhi with the help of $$$ he put both the packets in dry ice trays and as per pre -arrangement these packets were to be removed and delivered to him near $$$ by the catering staff and that he had agreed to pay for this job to that person that he had to hand over this gold to the respondent and in return he was to get out of the profit that his share of investment in the gold seized on.was lacs and that the balance was invested by the respondent. he admitted that earlier he had g to frankfurt via dubai and came back to delhi on occasions and brought gold in the same manner. the authorities recorded the statements of all the persons involved. however the statement of the respondent could not be recorded as in spite of numerous summons he did not cooperate with the investigating authorities and remained in hiding.c the commissir of customs delhi accorded sanction on.for the prosecution of the respondent $$$ ranbeer singh and others and accordingly complaint no. was filed in the court of acmm new delhi. the respondent was declared proclaimed offender by the ld. acmm new delhi in the subject case.d in the meantime adjudicating proceedings were initiated pursuant to the show cause notice to the respondent. order in original no. dated.was passed by the additional commissir of customs igi airport new delhi imposing penalty of lacs on the respondent. following observations in the said order are noteworthy:"in response to summons $$$ appeared before the customs authorities and he in his further voluntary statement dated.recorded under section of the customs act stated that he was shown the record of details of call charges of mobile ph number obtained from essar cell ph mobile ph services that on.and.teleph calls were made to teleph number that he had been told that teleph number belonged to $$$ and was his residence number and who had been arrested for smuggling of gold biscuits. on being asked about that he stated that neither did he know any person by name of $$$ nor his teleph number on being asked about as to how teleph calls were made to teleph number on.times and time on.from his mobile ph he stated that he did not know the exact date but in the month of april his younger brother $$$ came to delhi from dubai as his mother was seriously ill it might be possible that $$$ had made calls from his $$$ mobile ph to teleph number belonging to $$$ as he did not know $$$ and his teleph number.e the aforesaid order dated.was carried in appeal and the commissir of customs appeal vide his order dated.set aside the penalty imposed on the respondent. the appellate authority was of the view that there were persons having same name i.$$$ in dubai and the being the respondent and that beyond the statement of the co -accused there was no material on record. during the course of this order it was observed as under:"if the investment was made by shri pramod kumar of dubai then it can not be linked to the $$$. the department has not made shri pramod kumar of dubai a party in the case and nothing is on record to suggest that efforts were made to trace and identify shri pramod kumar of dubai and how the telephone number in dubai i.is linked to the $$$.thus there is only the lone statement of shri varyam singh alleging the involvement of the $$$ and is not corroborated by the statement of any other person or by any documentary evidence. on the other hand the claim of the $$$ that he had left india on.and since then he has not visited india again is corroborated by the statements of various persons tendered under section of the customs act and also by documentary evidence i.copies of his passports. no other person involved in the case has mentioned anything about the $$$. thus the statement of shri varyam singh who himself accepted as evidence whereas the claim of the $$$ is supported by way of corroborative statements under section of the customs act and documentary evidence is acceptable as credible evidence in his favour. moreover the $$$ has not laid any claim on the impugned gold under seizure in this case.keeping the above in view the finding of the adjudicating authority about the $$$ are not fair legal and based on facts and hence the penalty imposed on the $$$ is hereby set aside.f based on the observations and findings rendered in the aforesaid order dated.a petition under section of the code of criminal procedure being crl. m.c. no. of was filed on behalf of the respondent in the high court of delhi at new delhi. it is relevant to note that in the petition itself addresses of the respondent were given of dubai and the other of delhi. the affidavit in support of the petition was filed by none other than shri $$$ the brother of the respondent. it was submitted on behalf of the department that the respondent had not joined investigation and as such the instant petition did not deserve any consideration and that there were not $$$ but only person having addresses. the high court by its judgment and order under appeal allowed the petition and quashed complaint no.  pending before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate new delhi. it was observed by the high court as under:"the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the respondent department against the $$$ is the same that was before the appellate authority and since the appellate authority had considered the entire evidence and come to above conclusion i consider that no useful purpose would be served by continuing with the prosecution against the $$$ before the trial court. the exoneration of the respondent in the adjudication proceedings was the basis for petition under section code of criminal procedure and such exoneration certainly weighed with the high court. in collector of customs v. l.r. melwani $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ scr question nos. and posed before the constitution bench of this court were as $$$ whether the prosecution from which these criminal revision petitions arose is barred under article of the constitution as against accused and in that case by reason of the decision of the collector of customs in the proceedings under the sea customs act?(ii whether under any circumstance the finding of the collector of customs that the st and nd accused are not proved to be guilty operated as in issue estoppel in the criminal case against those. the observations of the court in respect of aforesaid questions were as under:"...the rule laid down in that decision was adopted by this court in pritam singh v. state of punjab and again in n.r. ghose v. state of w.b. but before an accused can call into aid the above rule he must establish that in a previous lawful trial before a competent court he has secured a verdict of acquittal which verdict is binding on his prosecutor. in the instant case for the reasons already mentioned we are unable to hold that the proceeding before the collector of customs is a criminal trial. from this it follows that the decision of the collector does not amount to a verdict of acquittal in favour of accused and. a subsequent -judge bench in k.g. premshankar v. inspector of police $$$ / sc/01/$$$$$$$ / sc/01/$$$$ scc acc sc considered the effect of the decision of a civil court on criminal proceedings and it was concluded as . what emerges from the aforesaid discussion is.the previous judgment which is final can be relied upon as provided under sections to of the evidence act in civil suits between the same parties principle of res judicata may apply in a criminal case section code of criminal procedure makes provision that once a person is convicted or acquitted he may not be tried again for the same offence if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied if the criminal case and the civil proceedings are for the same cause judgment of the civil court would be relevant if conditions of any of sections to are satisfied but it can not be said that the same would be conclusive except as provided in section. section provides which judgment would be conclusive proof of what is stated therein. further the judgment order or decree passed in a previous civil proceeding if relevant as provided under sections and or other provisions of the evidence act then in each case the court has to decide to what extent it is binding or conclusive with regard to the matter(s decided therein.. in the present case the decision rendered by the constitution bench in m.s. sheriff case would be binding wherein it has been specifically held that no hard -and -fast rule can be laid down and that possibility of conflicting decision in civil and criminal courts is not a relevant consideration. the law envisages.such an eventuality when it expressly refrains from making the decision of court binding on the other or even relevant except for limited purpose such as sentence or damages '. the exoneration in related adjudication proceedings and the effect thereof on criminal proceedings again came up for consideration before a -judge bench of this court in radheshyam kejriwal v. state of west bengal and anr. $$$ / sc/014/$$$$$$$ / sc/014/$$$$ scc. in his dissenting opinion p. sathasivam j.as the learned chief justice then was concluded that there was nothing in foreign exchange regulation act to indicate that a finding in adjudication is binding on a court in prosecution under section of act or that the prosecution under section depended upon the result of the adjudication under the act. c.k. prasad j.speaking for the majority summed up as under:"8. the ratio which can be culled out from these decisions can broadly be stated as follows:(i adjudication proceedings and criminal prosecution can be launched $$$$ decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating criminal prosecution;(iii adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in nature to each other;(iv the finding against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication proceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution;(v adjudication proceedings by the enforcement directorate is not prosecution by a competent court of law to attract the provisions of article of the constitution or section of the code of criminal procedure;(vi the finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person facing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding if the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and not on merit prosecution may continue in case of exoneration however on merits where the allegation is found to be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent criminal prosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances can not be allowed to continue the underlying principle being the higher standard of proof in criminal cases. the majority judgment in radheyshyam kejriwal v. state of west bengal and anr. $$$ / sc/014/$$$$$$$ / sc/014/$$$$ scc is relied upon by the respondent in support of the submission that the exoneration in the present case being on merits criminal prosecution on the same set of facts ought not to be allowed to continue. ms. ranjana nara -yan learned advocate appeared for the appellant while mr. naveen malhotra learned advocate appeared for the respondent. we have considered rival submissions and gone through the record which brings out following crucial facets:(a the order in original dated.referred to the statement of $$$ the brother of the respondent which clearly suggests that the respondent had come down to delhi in april. this statement is not even referred to in the appellate order dated.but a finding is rendered that the respondent had not visited india after september.the respondent was declared a proclaimed offender and had not participated in any of the proceedings personally. in the circumstances no weightage could be given to copies of the passport submitted in support of the assertion that he had not visited india after september.the appellate order further discloses that the statement of varyam singh did allege the involvement of the respondent. in law if such statement is otherwise admissible and reliable conviction can lawfully rest on such material.the finding in the appellate order that there were $$$ is completely incorrect and unstatable.in the back drop of these facts it can not be accepted that the exoneration of the respondent in the adjudication proceeding was on merits or that he was found completely innocent.considering the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the high court was not right and justified in accepting the prayer for quashing of the proceedings. we therefore allow this appeal and set -aside the view taken by the high court. case no.  on the file of the acmm new delhi shall be proceeded with in accordance with law.
