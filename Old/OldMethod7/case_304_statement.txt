final orders in terms of the settlement. mr. malegam submitted his valuation report with his covering letter dated.. after assessing the intrinsic worth of the companies as going concerns the value of.% shares was arrived at at rs.crores. a brief reference to the salient features of valuation may be appropriate. the valuer considered methods of valuation. asset based earning based market based. while working out the earning based valuation the value on the basis of capitalization of past earnings was adopted. the discounted cash flow method which is the commonly used methodology for future earnings based valuation was eschewed from consideration. the reasons given by the valuer are no independent party projections have been provided both parties have provided projections which differ substantially as illustrated in tables.and.. the basic principle and method of evaluation has been stated thus:"the intrinsic value of the share would be based on the asset and earnings based value with appropriate weight ages given to the methods. since the value of a company business would be more influenced by its earnings value a higher weightage is given to the earnings value as compared to its asset value. the asset value is considered as an integral part of the intrinsic value as it has a persuasive impact. thus i have considered the following weight ages for determining the intrinsic value asset based value weightage earnings based value weightagethe market for listed company its market price based value indicates the value ascribed by the buyer / seller of the share at a given point in time. this is influenced by the floating stock and the supply and demand which gets reflected in the volume and price of market transactions market perceptions related to-- the overall market-- the industry-- the companythe recommended value is the higher of the intrinsic value or the market based value. though rationally speaking the recommended value should be the intrinsic value it may be possible that the market based value at a given point of time is higher than the intrinsic value which is indicative of a bullish phase / perception of the market and/or industry and/or the company. therefore to take into account this practical reality i have suggested the higher of the. the intrinsic worth of the companies and the value of.% shares in the companies are set out at para.. as already stated the value of.% shares has been worked out as.crores. it was made clear that the above value has been determined on the basis that.% shareholding carries no special rights. in this context the valuer has referred to the claim of the petitirs that the value of.% holding should be higher than the value derived by applying the percentage to the intrinsic worth of the companies. in other words the contention of the petitirs was that the shares are to be valued on the basis that.% forms part of the combined holding of % of the indian promoters ' shareholding. the respective contentions in this regard have been analysed by the valuer as follows the shares are to be valued on the basis of a holding of.% then this holding does not give any special advantage to the holder or in this case even to the purchaser since the respondents collectively hold in the companies.% of the share capital of each company. on that consideration the value of the shares can only be.% of the intrinsic worth of the companies.on the other hand if the shares are to be valued on the basis that the.% forms part of the combined holding of % and therefore carries special rights then there has to be a premium attached to the value of the shares. accordingly the value of the.% shareholding would be the value determined by taking.% of the intrinsic worth of the companies and adding thereto a control premium. the valuer concluded that he was not competent to decide upon this controversial legal issue and therefore the valuation was d without adding the element of control premium. another aspect debated before the valuer was whether the value of the $$$ and $$$ brands which are the original research products of the foreign promoter should be considered in the valuation of the.% shares in dil. it was contended by the petitirs that dil was legally entitled to carry on its business in $$$ and $$$ along with other brands. the rights over these brands were transferred to dupen laboratories private ltd. and such transfer according to the petitir was in breach of contractual obligations under the trademark license agreement dated.etc. the valuer after referring to the contentions observed thus..the brands $$$ and $$$ have been purchased by solvay pharmaceuticals bv from dupen laboratories private limited. as such these are not the assets of dil. dil also has no investment in dupen laboratories private limited. whatever may be the claims of the petitirs in this matter against the respondents this is not a matter which should affect the valuation of the shares of dil. the petitirs have objected to the valuation by filing ia nos. and of wherein a prayer has been made to submit a supplementary valuation report after adding control premium to.% shares and by adopting the dcf method of valuation and including therein the value of $$$ and $$$ brands. in other words the main objections are. that the control premium has not been $$$$. the value of the brands $$$ and $$$ which according to the petitirs continued to be the property of dil has not been included;$$$$. discounted cash flow method has not been adopted though it is a generally accepted method even according to the valuer. the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitirs relying on the decisions in $$$ v. prince and ors. all er and burgess v. purchase & sons all er has contended that notwithstanding the finality attached to the decision of the valuer the court can intervene if the valuation was made on a fundamentally errous basis or a patent mistake has been committed by the valuer. even accepting this principle we are unable to hold that the valuation is vitiated by a demonstrably wrong approach or a fundamental error doing to the root of the valuation. the and foremost contention has focused itself on the non addition of control premium. it is the contention of the petitirs that.per cent shareholding which the respondents mr. vasant kumar and another have agreed to purchase is part of the promoters ' shareholding of % and they consciously avoided buying the other shares which were acquired by the petitirs from the market. certain special rights and privileges were attached to these promoters ' shareholding and therefore the intrinsic worth of the shares should have been assessed by adding the control premium. as already noticed the valuer has adverted to the respective contentions in this regard and indicated the implications of treating or not treating.per cent shares as part of the combined shareholding of the promoters. the valuer rightly refrained from going into this contentious issue. however the court has to necessarily address itself to this issue canvassed before us. in answering this question the terms of settlement must be kept uppermost in the mind. it may be that the respondent $$$ agreed to purchase only.per cent shares of the petitirs on account of these shares forming part of the promoters ' shareholding and in that sense they may have some additional value. but the court has to go by the terms of settlement which is the last word on the subject. the terms do not either in express terms or by necessary implication contemplate the valuation by determining the intrinsic worth of.% shares having due regard to their special or distinctive characteristics. the terms of the settlement as already noticed contemplate the valuation of the intrinsic worth of the companies dil and dpil as going concerns and the value of.per cent shareholding by the petitirs has to be worked out on that basis. as rightly contended by the learned senior counsel for the respondents if the parties wanted a special treatment to be given to these shares and a control premium or the like has to be added it should have been specifically and expressly mentid in the terms of settlement. such an important aspect would not have been omitted while framing the terms of settlement if the parties had agreed to the valuation on that basis. what has not been said in the terms of settlement in specific and clear terms can not be superimposed by the court while interpreting the terms of settlement. the language employed in the terms of settlement which we presume would have been drafted after obtaining expert legal advice does not even necessarily imply that special weightage in the form of control premium has to be given to these.per cent shares. if the petitirs had insisted on the incorporation of such a provision it could very well be that the other party or parties would not have agreed to such stipulation. the court can not therefore give any direction in regard to control premium. the next objection is directed against the non -inclusion of vertin and colopsa brands while valuing the intrinsic worth of the company dil. in our view the learned valuer has given relevant reasons for non -inclusion of the said brand of drugs which stood transferred to solvay pharmaceuticals bv from $$$. ltd. they are not the existing assets of dil. in fact the petitirs have put in issue in of the suits filed by them the legality of transfer and sought for a declaration that dil continues to be the proprietor of the brands. the petitioners have agreed to withdraw various suits. in any case the petitioners can not be permitted to thwart the terms of the settlement by inviting the valuer or this court to go into the extraneous issue as regards the validity of the transfer or incidental matters. the assets as per the relevant records have to be taken into account by the valuer and that has been done. we therefore find no apparent error in excluding those brands. the other objection is about dcf method of valuation which the valuer has described as a commonly accepted method in adopting future earning based valuation. this involves discounting the net free cash flow of a business at an appropriate discount rate. we have already adverted to the reasons given by the valuer for not adopting this method of valuation. those reasons can not be said to be irrelevant. it is contended that if the data and projections furnished by the parties is not reliable the valuer should have secured the relevant data from independent sources or could have called for further particulars. we find no merit in this argument. the dcf method is adopted while resorting to valuation based on future earnings. it is not the case of the petitioners that the future earning based valuation is the only reliable method of earnings based valuation. moreover the petitioners have not placed any facts and figures to show that such method of valuation would result in a definite increase in the share value going by independent projections. when there are vast discrepancies between the projection given by the parties and independent projections have not been provided the valuer has chosen the best possible method of evaluation by capitalizing the past earnings. in doing so the future maintainable profits based on past performance is also an element that has gone into the calculation. no prejudice whatsoever is shown to have been caused to the petitioners by the earnings based valuation. the petitioners have relied on the decision of this court in commissioner of gift tax bombay v. smt. kusumben d. mahadevia manu / sc/0$$$$00/979manu / sc/0$$$$00/979. after referring to mahadeo jalan 's case manu / $$$ / sc/0$$$$/97 wherein certain principles regarding valuation of shares were laid down it was observed thus:"it is clear from this decision that where the shares in a public limited company are quoted on the stock exchange and there are dealings in them the price prevailing on the valuation date would represent the value of the shares. but where the shares in a public limited company are not quoted on the stock exchange or the shares are in a private limited company the proper method of valuation to be adopted would be the profit -earning method this method may be applied by taking the dividends as reflecting the profit -earning capacity of the company on reasonable commercial basis but if it is found that the dividends do not correctly reflect the profit -earning capacity because only a small proportion of the profits is distributed by way of dividends and a large amount of profits is systematically accumulated in the form of reserves the dividend method of valuation may be rejected and the valuation may be made by reference to the profits. the profit earning method takes into account the profits which the company has been making and should be capable of making and the valuation according to this method is based on the average maintainable profits. we do not think that the valuation in the instant case runs counter to the principles laid down therein. as seen from enclosures.and.to the valuation report the valuer had arrived at market based valuation in addition to the other modes of valuation and observed that the recommended value is the higher of the intrinsic value or the marked based value. thus the petitioners had the benefit of higher valuation. the principle laid down in the above decision has been kept in view. moreover the profit earning method which has been referred to in the above decisions in the context of valuation of shares of a private limited company has also been applied though future earnings based valuation has not been done in the absence of reliable figures. as observed by us earlier the profit earning capacity of the company has not been excluded from consideration thus the valuer 's mode of valuation does not in anyway infringe the principles laid down in the said decisions to the extant they are applicable. in final analysis we are of the view that the valuer approached the question of valuation having due regard to the terms of settlement and applying the standard methods of valuation. the valuation has been considered from all appropriate angles. no case has been made out that any irrelevant material has been taken into account or relevant material has been eschewed from consideration by the valuer. the plea that the valuation is vitiated by fundamental errors can not but be rejected. in the result ia nos. to are liable to be rejected. however there is direction concerning the interest which we consider it appropriate to give in the given facts and circumstances of the case. though the grant of interest as prayed for by the petitioners from.--the stipulated date of submission of valuation report is not called for we feel that the ends of justice would be adequately met if the respondents concerned are directed to pay the interest at the rate of per cent on.crores which is the value of shares fixed by the valuer for a period of months. true the petitioners contested the valuation and thereby delayed the implementation of settlement however having regard to the bona fide nature of the dispute and the fact that the respondents have retained the money otherwise payable to the petitioners during this period of months and could have profitably utilized the same we have given this direction taking an overall view. in the result ias and of are dismissed subject to the above direction as to payment of interest. the slp(c nos. -of shall stand disposed of in terms of the settlement on record coupled with the direction to pay the sum of rs.crores representing the value of.% shares together with interest @ per cent for a period of months within a period of weeks from $$$$ subject to the receipt of share transfer forms and the fulfillment of other formalities by the petitioners. the suits which have given rise to these slps and other suits and proceedings mentioned in the memorandum of settlement shall stand dismissed as withdrawn. accordingly the slps are disposed of. no order as to costs.
