$$$ j. leave granted. an appeal under section of the securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest act hereinafter referred to as sarfaesi act before the debt recovery appellate tribunal hereinafter referred to as drat can be entertained only if the borrower deposits per cent of the amount in terms of the order passed by the debt recovery tribunal hereinafter referred to as $$$ under section of the act or per cent of the amount due from the borrower as claimed by the secured creditor whichever is less. the appellate tribunal may reduce the amount to per cent. what is the fate of such deposit on the disposal of the appeal is the question arising for consideration in this case. being a pure legal issue it may not be necessary for us to refer to the factual position in detail. the respondent being a borrower and aggrieved by the steps taken by the secured creditor filed securitisation application no. of before the debt recovery tribunal ahmedabad. though initially an interim relief was granted the same was vacated by order dated.. therefore the respondent moved the debt recovery appellate tribunal mumbai under section of the sarfaesi act. in terms of the proviso under section the respondent made a deposit of rs. lakhs before the appellate tribunal. during the pendency of the appeal before the drat securitisation application itself came to be finally disposed of before the debt recovery tribunal at ahmedabad setting aside the sale. realising that the appeal did not survive thereafter the respondent sought permission to withdraw the same and also for refund of the deposit of rs. lakhs. permission was granted however making it subject to the disposal of the appeal. as the appeal itself was being withdrawn the respondent moved the high court of gujarat at ahmedabad by way of $$$ special civil application aggrieved by the observation that the withdrawal would be subject to the result of the appeal. the same was disposed of by order dated.by the learned single judge setting aside the said condition and permitting the respondent herein to withdraw the amount unconditionally. aggrieved the $$$ -bank filed an intra -court appeal. that appeal was dismissed by order dated.by a division bench and thus aggrieved the bank has come up in appeal before this court. heard learned senior counsel shri c.u. singh appearing for the $$$ -bank and learned counsel prashant pandit appearing for the respondents. the learned senior counsel appearing for the $$$ -bank submits that the respondent has no right to get back the deposit made by it as a pre -condition for entertaining the appeal. the said amount has to be set off against the dues of the respondent which has actually been quantified and for which section recovery steps have been permitted. it is submitted that the $$$ -bank has to secure the entire debt by proceeding against the secured assets and therefore the deposit is liable to be appropriated by the bank. reference is also made to section of the sarfaesi act and rule of the security interest enforcement rules which read as $$$$ where dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied with the sale proceeds of the secured assets the secured creditor may file an application in the form and manner as may be prescribed to the debts recovery tribunal having jurisdiction or a competent court as the case may be for recovery of the balance amount from the borrower. procedure for recovery of shortfall of secured debt.an application for recovery of balance amount by any

by under $$$ -rule.an application under $$$ -rule shall be accompanied with fee as provided in rule of the debts recovery tribunal procedure rules. $$$ further submits that the bank has a lien on the amount under section of the indian contract act. the decision of the high court of gujarat in $$$ ganesh $$$ v. union of india and $$$. $$$ / gj/00/00$$$ / gj/00/00 air guj. which has been followed by the division bench in the impugned judgment does not reflect the true legal position it is further submitted. $$$ supra was a case involving a challenge on the vires of the proviso under section of the sarfaesi act on the mandatory pre -deposit. while upholding the provision at paragraphs- and it was observed that in case the appeal is dismissed the amounts deposited for entertaining the appeal would be refunded. to quote:. right of appeal is a creature of the statute. legislature can impose conditions under which it is to be exercised. without a statutory provision creating such a right a person aggrieved is not entitled to prefer an appeal. legislature while granting right of appeal can impose conditions which it thinks reasonable. such conditions merely regulate the exercise of right of appeal so that the same is not abused by a recalcitrant party and there is no difficulty in the enforcement of the order appealed against in case the appeal is ultimately dismissed. imposition of such a condition is essential so that frivolous appeals would not be filed. ultimately if the appeal is dismissed the aggrieved party can always seek refund of the amount deposited and therefore he is not in any way aggrieved. further the proviso to section of the securitization act also enables the appellate tribunal for the reasons to be recorded in writing reduce the amount to not less than % of the debt referred to in the proviso. we are not prepared to accept the contention that conditions imposed in the and proviso to section of the securitization act are rous in nature so as to make the right of appeal illusory. delhi high court in r.v. saxena 's case supra also upheld the validity of proviso to section of the securitization act with which we fully concur. we have also not come across any provision in the statute enabling the secured creditor to adjust or appropriate the amount deposited by the borrower to prefer an appeal under section of the act. on dismissal of the appeal the amount deposited as a pre -condition for filing the appeal will be refunded to the $$$ and therefore he is no way prejudiced. we therefore find no merit in the contention raised by the $$$ that the proviso to section of the act is discriminatory or violative of article of the constitution of india. petitions lack merit and the same are dismissed. at this juncture it may be necessary to refer to the scheme of the sarfaesi act. the act was intended to facilitate easy and faster recovery of loans advanced by banks and financial institutions. the ordinary recovery mechanism contemplated in the code of civil procedure was not considered sufficient. thus the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act was introduced for a special and speedier mechanism for the recovery. $$$$ of experience proved that the recovery process was not achieving the intended objects and hence the sarfaesi act to regulate securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest was enacted. the act incorporates a system whereby direct action for recovery of secured debt may be initiated against the secured assets of a borrower after the debt is declared to be a non performing asset npa. borrower is defined under section which reads as follows:()(f borrower means any person who has been granted financial assistance by any bank or financial institution or who has given any guarantee or created any mortgage or pledge as security for the financial assistance granted by any bank or financial institution and includes a person who becomes borrower of a securitisation company or reconstruction company consequent upon acquisition by it of any rights or interest of any bank or financial institution in relation to such financial assistance;0. secured asset under section is defined as:()(zc secured asset means the property on which the security interest is created. section provides for definition of secured creditor which reads as follows:()(zd secured creditor means any bank or financial institution or any consortium or group of banks or financial institutions and includes--(i debenture trustee appointed by any bank or financial institution securitisation company or reconstruction company whether acting as such or managing a trust set up by such securitisation company or reconstruction company for the securitisation or reconstruction as the case may be or any other trustee holding securities on behalf of a bank or financial institution in whose favour security interest is created for due repayment by any borrower of any financial assistance;. section defines secured debt to mean a debt which is secured by any security interest. security interest is defined under section security interest means right title and interest of any kind whatsoever upon property created in favour of any secured creditor and includes any mortgage charge hypothecation assignment other than those specified in section. the mechanism for enforcement of security interest is contemplated under section of the act. $$$ -sections a and of section are relevant for the purposes of the present case and they are extracted below:. enforcement of security interest( notwithstanding anything contained in section or section of the transfer of property act of any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the intervention of court or tribunal by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this act.where any borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security agreement makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any installment thereof and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non -performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor within days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under $$$ -section.the notice referred to in $$$ -section shall give details of the amount payable by the borrower and the secured assets intended to be enforced by the secured creditor in the event of non -payment of secured debts by the borrower.a if on receipt of the notice under $$$ -section the borrower makes any representation or raises any objection the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable he shall communicate within week of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for non -acceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower $$$ that the reasons so communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons shall not confer any right upon the borrower to prefer an application to the debts recovery tribunal under section or the court of district judge under section.in case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in $$$ -section the secured creditor may take recourse to or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt namely:-(a take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset;(b take over the management of the business of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset $$$ that the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale shall be exercised only where the substantial part of the business of the borrower is held as security for the debt.$$$ further that where the management of whole of the business or part of the business is severable the secured creditor shall take over the management of such business of the borrower which is relatable to the security for the debt.appoint any person hereafter referred to as the manager to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor;(d require at any time by notice in writing any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any my is due or may become due to the borrower to pay the secured creditor so much of the my as is sufficient to pay the secured debt. a conspectus of the aforesaid provisions shows that under the scheme of the sarfaesi act a secured creditor is entitled to proceed against the borrower for the purpose of recovering his secured debt by taking action against the secured assets in case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in the notice issued under section of the act. it is the mandate of section of the act that the notice issued under section should contain details of the amount payable by the borrower and also the secured assets intended to be enforced by the secured creditor in the event of non -payment of the dues as per section notice. thus the secured creditor is entitled to proceed only against the secured assets mentid in the notice under section. however in terms of section of the act the secured creditor is also free to proceed against the guarantors or sell the pledged assets. to quote:( without prejudice to the rights conferred on the secured creditor under or by this section the secured creditor shall be entitled to proceed against the guarantors or sell the pledged assets without taking any of the measures specified in clauses a to d of $$$ -section in relation to the secured assets under this act. section of the act provides for a right to appeal to the drt in respect of the grievances on the measures taken by the secured creditor under

from the date on which such measure had been taken $$$ that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower.explanation for the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the communication of the reasons to the borrower by the secured creditor for not having accepted his representation or objection or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of communication of reasons to the borrower shall not entitle the person including borrower to make an application to the debts recovery tribunal under $$$ -section.the debts recovery tribunal shall consider whether any of the measures referred to in $$$ -section of section taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security are in accordance with the provisions of this act and the rules made thereunder.if the debts recovery tribunal after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence produced by the parties comes to the conclusion that any of the measures referred to in $$$ -section of section taken by the secured creditor are not in accordance with the provisions of this act and the rules made thereunder and require restoration of the management of the business to the borrower or restoration of possession of the secured assets to the borrower it may by order declare the recourse to any or more measures referred to in $$$ -section of section taken by the secured creditors as invalid and restore the possession of the secured assets to the borrower or restore the management of the business to the borrower as the case may be and pass such order as it may consider appropriate and necessary in relation to any of the recourse taken by the secured creditor under $$$ -section of section.if the debts recovery tribunal declares the recourse taken by a secured creditor under $$$ -section of section is in accordance with the provisions of this act and the rules made thereunder then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor shall be entitled to take recourse to or more of the measures specified under $$$ -section of section to recover his secured debt.any application made under $$$ -section shall be dealt with by the debts recovery tribunal as expeditiously as possible and disposed of within days from the date of such application $$$ that the

specified in sub -section any party to the application may make an application in such form as may be prescribed to the appellate tribunal for directing the debts recovery tribunal for expeditious disposal of the application pending before the debts recovery tribunal and the appellate tribunal may on such application make an order for expeditious disposal of the pending application by the debts recovery tribunal.save as otherwise provided in this act the debts recovery tribunal shall as far as may be dispose of the application in accordance with the provisions of the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act and the rules made thereunder. though section of the act is titled as a right to appeal the liberty granted to the aggrieved person is to make an application to the drt and the parties are at a liberty to lead evidence before the tribunal. and thus it is actually a trial before the drt on the grievances of the aggrieved persons in the respect of the measures taken by the secured creditor for recovery of dues of the borrower in proceeding against the secured assets. see mardia chemicals v. union of india $$$ / sc/033/$$$$$$$ / sc/033/$$$$ scc. the actual appeal is contemplated under section of the sarfaesi act. the provision reads as follows:18. appeal to appellate tribunal.any person aggrieved by any order made by the debts recovery tribunal under section may prefer an appeal alongwith such fee as may be prescribed to the appellate tribunal within days from the date of receipt of the order of debts recovery tribunal $$$ that different fees may be prescribed for filing an appeal by the borrower or by the person other than the borrower $$$ further that no appeal shall be entertained unless the borrower has deposited with the appellate tribunal per cent of the amount of debt due from him as claimed by the secured creditors or determined by the debts recovery tribunal whichever is less $$$ also that the appellate tribunal may for the reasons to be recorded in writing reduce the amount to not less than -per cent. of debt referred to in the proviso.save as otherwise provided in this act the appellate tribunal shall as far as may be dispose of the appeal in accordance with the provisions of the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act of and rules made thereunder. any person aggrieved by the order of the drt under section of the sarfaesi act is entitled to prefer an appeal along with the prescribed fee within the permitted period of days. for preferring an appeal a fee is prescribed whereas for the tribunal to entertain the appeal the aggrieved person has to make a deposit of per cent of the amount of debt due from him as claimed by the secured creditors or determined by the drt whichever is less. this amount can at the discretion of the tribunal in appropriate cases for recorded reasons be reduced to per cent of the debt. this court in lakshmi rattan engineering works limited v. assistant commissir sales tax kanpur and $$$. $$$ / sc/0309/1967$$$ / sc/0309/1967 air sc had the occasion to consider the meaning of the expression entertain in the context of a similar provision in the uttar pradesh sales tax act where it was held that in such context the expression has the meaning of admitting to consideration. the relevant discussion is available at paragraphs-9 and. the word entertain is explained by a divisional bench of the allahabad high court as denoting the point of time at which an application to set aside the sale is heard by the court. the expression entertain it is stated does not mean the same thing as the filing of the application or admission of the application by the court. a similar view was again taken in dhoom chand jain v. $$$ and $$$. $$$ / up/0132/1962$$$ / up/0132/1962 air all. in which the learned chief justice $$$ and mr. justice $$$ gave the same meaning to the expression entertain. it is observed by $$$. that the word entertain in its application bears the meaning admitting to consideration and therefore when the court can not refuse to take an application which is backed by deposit or security it can not refuse judicially to consider it. in a single bench decision of the same court reported in $$$ and $$$. v. $$$ a.i.r. all. of us bhargava j.had to consider the same rule. there the deposit had not been made within the period of limitation and the question had arisen whether the court could entertain the application or not. it was decided that the application could not be entertained because proviso debarred the court from entertaining an objection unless the requirement of depositing the amount or furnishing security was complied with within the time prescribed. in that case of the word entertain is not interpreted but it is held that the court can not proceed to consider the application in the absence of deposit made within the time allowed by law. this case turned on the fact that the deposit was made out of time. in yet another case of the allahabad high court reported in haji $$$ and sons and ors. v. firm samiullah and sons manu / up/0091/$$$$manu / up/0091/$$$$ a.i.r. all. a division bench consisting of chief justice $$$ and mr. justice s.d. singh interpreted the words of order rule by saying that the word entertain meant not receive or accept but proceed to consider on merits ' or adjudicate upon. in our opinion these cases have taken a correct view of the word entertain which according to dictionary also means admit to consideration. it would therefore appear that the direction to the court in the proviso to section is that the court shall not proceed to admit to consideration an appeal which is not accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the admitted tax. this will be when the case is taken up by the court for the time. in the decision on which the assistant commissioner relied the learned chief justice desai c.j.holds that the words accompanied by showed that something tangible had to accompany the memorandum of appeal. if the memorandum of appeal had to be accompanied by satisfactory proof it had to be in the shape of something tangible because no intangible thing can accompany a document like the memorandum of appeal. in our opinion making an appeal the equivalent of the memorandum of appeal is not sound. even under order of the code of civil procedure the expression appeal and memorandum of appeal are used to distinct distinct things. in wharton 's $$$ the word appeal is defined as the judicial examination of the decision by a higher court of the decision of an inferior court. the appeal is the judicial examination the memorandum of appeal contains the grounds on which the judicial examination is invited. for purposes of limitation and for purposes of the rules of the court it is required that a written memorandum of appeal shall be filed. when the proviso speaks of the entertainment of the appeal it means that the appeal such as was filed will not be admitted to consideration unless there is satisfactory proof available of the making of the deposit of admitted tax. we are also conscious of the fact that such a precondition is present in several statutes while providing for statutory appeals like the income -tax act the central excise act the consumer protection act the motor vehicles act etc. however unlike those statutes the purpose of the sarfaesi act is different it is meant only for speedy recovery of the dues and the scheme under section of the act permits the secured creditor to proceed only against the secured assets. of course the secured creditor is free to proceed against the guarantors and the pledged assets notwithstanding the steps under section and without exhausting the recovery as against secured assets referred to in the notice under section. but such guarantor if aggrieved is not entitled to approach drt under section. that right is restricted only to persons aggrieved by steps under section proceeding for recovery against the secured assets. the appeal under section of the act is permissible only against the order passed by the drt under section of the act. under section the scope of enquiry is limited to the steps taken under section against the secured assets. the partial deposit before the drat as a pre -condition for considering the appeal on merits in terms of section of the act is not a secured asset. it is not a secured debt either since the borrower or the aggrieved person has not created any security interest on such pre -deposit in favour of the secured creditor. if that be so on disposal of the appeal either on merits or on withdrawal or on being rendered infructuous in case the $$$ makes a prayer for refund of the pre -deposit the same has to be allowed and the pre -deposit has to be returned to the $$$ unless the appellate tribunal on the request of the secured creditor but with the consent of the depositors had already appropriated the pre -deposit towards the liability of the borrower or with the consent had adjusted the amount towards the dues or if there be any attachment on the pre -deposit in any proceedings under section of the act read with rule of the security interest enforcement rules or if there be any attachment in any other proceedings known to law. we are also unable to agree with the contention that the bank has a lien on the pre -deposit made under section of the sarfaesi act in terms of section of the indian contract act. section of the indian contract act on general lien is in a different context:. general lien of bankers factors wharfingers attorneys and policy -brokers.--bankers factors wharfingers attorneys of a high court and policy -brokers may in the absence of a contract to the contrary retain as a security for a general balance of account any goods bailed to them but no other persons have a right to retain as a security for such balance goods bailed to them unless there is an express contract to that effect. section of the indian contract act provides for retention of the goods bailed to the bank by way of security for the general balance of account. the pre -deposit made by a borrower for the purpose of entertaining the appeal under section of the act is not with the bank but with the tribunal. it is not a bailment with the bank as provided under section of the indian contract act. conceptually it should be an argument available to the depositor since the goods bailed are to be returned or otherwise disposed of after the purpose is accomplished as per the directions of the bailor. in the case before us the first respondent had in fact sought withdrawal of the appeal since the $$$ had already proceeded against the secured assets by the time the appeal came up for consideration on merits. there is neither any order of appropriation during the pendency of the appeal nor any attachment on the pre -deposit. therefore the deposit made by the first respondent is liable to be returned to the first respondent. though for different reasons as well we endorse the view taken by the high court. thus there is no merit in the appeal. it is accordingly dismissed. we make it clear that the dismissal of the appeal is without prejudice to the liberty available to the appellant to take appropriate steps under section of the sarfaesi act read with rule of the security interest enforcement rules. there shall be no order as to costs.
