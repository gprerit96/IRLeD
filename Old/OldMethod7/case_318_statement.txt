beverages ' falling under sub -heading.in the customs tariff act -and -not being alcoholic beverages ' and not being covered by the exceptions mentid in the said proposal at sl. no.  the rate of duty

manufacture of beverages ' clearly explains that it covers compound alcoholic preparations for the manufacture of beverages and that it is a product that precedes the consumable alcoholic beverage and hence it can not by any stretch of imagination be equated to and or termed as alcoholic beverages in itself. if compound alcoholic preparations of a kind used for the manufacture of beverages are sought to be included in the term ' spirits liquors and other spirituous beverages ' and or sought to be treated as $$$ then the statutory term compound alcoholic preparations of a kind used for the manufacture of beverages ' distinctly falling under sub -heading.will be redundant and such a perverse interpretation is not permissible as it will alter the statutory heading.and sub -heading.in the customs tariff act. he would further submit that harmonized system of nomenclature hsn an international regulation evolved in by the customs co -operation council brussels which is adopted by the govt. of india clearly recognizes that $$$ of a kind used in the manufacture of beverages ' are distinct and different products from alcoholic beverage which are intended for immediate consumption and in the said hsn explanatory notes dealing with sub -heading it is expressly stated that these preparations are not intended for immediate consumption and thus can be distinguished from the liquors and other spirituous beverages of this heading. in this connection he places reliance on a judgment of the bombay high court in bussa overseas and properties $$$.ltd. v. union of india reported in manu / ce/00/0manu / ce/00/0 elt bom.wherein the bombay high court while dealing with classification has held that goods falling under sub -heading.namely $$$ of a kind used in the manufacture of beverages

any authority of law and deprived the $$$ of profits of the said amount of rs. since -and -and thereby put an unreasonable restriction on the $$$ 's fundamental right as guaranteed by article of the constitution to carry on his trade and business since -and -. in support of this contention he places reliance on a judgment of this court in $$$ v. town area committee jabalpur and anr. reported in manu / $$$/00/manu / $$$/00/ air $$$. per contra learned senior counsel for respondents would submit that the speech of the finance minister while presenting the $$$ proposals only highlights the more important proposals of the budget $$$ changes are in fact enacted by the parliament as contained in the finance $$$ or ratified by parliament or implemented through notifications. the legal force for charging a particular rate of customs duty on import of goods is derived from the first schedule of the customs tariff act read with notifications issued under section of the act. if any changes in the rates were intended by parliament it would have been reflected in the respective finance $$$s. he further submits that there was no error or discrepancy between the budget proposals announced by the finance minister and the finance $$$. according to him the high court has rightly held that the $$$ did not dispute the fact that the goods imported by him fell within $$$.and the position under the finance act of was that the rate of duty prescribed for tariff sub -heading.was rs. per liter or % whichever is higher and the high court thus rightly held that budget proposals and the speech of the finance minister in parliament may or may not accept the proposal as held in b.k. industries v. union of india reported in manu / $$$/0/$$$$manu / $$$/0/$$$$ elt $$$ and once parliament has duly legislated and a rate of duty is prescribed in relation to a particular tariff heading that constitutes the authorities ' expression of the legislative will of parliament the speech of the finance minister and the financial / budget proposals duly passed by parliament are separate and distinct documents the law as enacted is what is contained in the finance act after it is legislated upon by the parliament. $$$ proposals constitute legislative material antecedent to the enactment of law. the rates of tax are those which are prescribed by legislation once it is enacted by parliament. it is the law as enacted which gives expression to legislative will and it is the law as enacted which prescribes the rate of tax which parliament has duly imposed. consequently as a matter of principle it would be impermissible for the court to undertake the exercise of entering upon a scrutiny of the correctness of the collective expression of legislative will which finds expression in the legislation as adopted by the parliament. in his submission the court can not undertake a scrutiny of whether there was an error on the part of the parliament in legislating to provide a particular rate of duty. the power to issue a notification under section of the act has been conferred upon the central government where it is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do. under sub -section of section the central government may where it is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do by special order in each case exempt from the payment of duty under circumstances of an exceptional nature to be stated in such order any goods on which duty is leviable and this court has observed in the case of union of india v. $$$ reported in manu / sc/00/manu / sc/00/ elt sc that the parliament can not constantly monitor the needs of and the emerging trends in the economy and is in no position to engage itself in day -to -day regulation and adjustment of import -export trade. accordingly the power is conferred upon the central government to provide for exemption from duty of goods either wholly or partly and with or without conditions as may be called for in public interest. we see no warrant for reading any limitation into this power. according to him the government of india i. the tru is fully empowered to decide the quantum of levy of duty on a particular commodity and to define it. therefore no wrong was committed by the tru when it held that the commodity imported by the $$$ did not enjoy the peak duty structure of % but fell under the exceptions and replied to the $$$ accordingly. the court therefore would not be justified in directing the central government to issue a notification in this case. he would further contend that the goods imported by the $$$ were cleared provisionally on payment of duty prescribed in the customs tariff act the imported compound alcoholic preparation was known as concentrated extracts. compound alcoholic preparations are used in the manufacture of various beverages and are not for immediate consumption. the claim of the $$$ -importer that duty should have been imposed at the rate of % for -and % in -and the claim that he had paid excess duty of rs. can not be sustained since all these consignments were assessed provisionally and the goods were classified under chapter $$$ no.of the first schedule to the then custom tariff and accordingly the goods were assessed provisionally and cleared on payment of appropriate duties. according to him the further contention of the $$$ -importer that exclusion in peak rate covers alcohol beverages but his imported goods are compound alcoholic preparation of a kind used for manufacturing of beverages which is not alcohol beverage and therefore not hit by the exclusion clause can not also be sustained. according to him the contention of the importer that during the impugned period the peak rate of duty was % as announced by the fm in his budget speech also can not be sustained because the proposed rate of maximum % was applicable to goods other than alcoholic beverages and passenger baggage. the speech of the fm in this regard was very clear and there is no ambiguity in the speech. alcohol beverages and passenger baggage have been taken out of the cover of maximum % rate duty. hence the contention of the $$$ -importer that the impugned imported goods were covered by fm speech for % rate duty is incorrect and in fact this is contrary to what was contemplated in the customs tariff act and the hsn explanatory notes. we have considered the extensive arguments submitted by the $$$ / party -in -person and g through the voluminous record placed before us and the respective submissions of the learned senior counsel for respondents. before adverting to the various arguments advanced by both sides and the findings recorded by the court below we deem it appropriate to extract the relevant tariff entry.under the customs tariff -and -which $$$. though it was already discussed in the preceding paragraphs about the reliefs sought by the $$$ before the high court we deem it appropriate to extract the same hereunder:( a writ of $$$ directing the and respondents to issue a notification under section of the customs act in order to exempt goods falling under $$$.so as to give effect to the budget proposal announced by the finance minister in parliament for financial years -and -a direction to the chief commissir of customs to finalize assessment of the bills of entry after a notification is issued by the and respondents under section of the customs act a writ of $$$ directing the respondent to issue a notification under section of the customs act for granting exemption from customs duty for goods falling under $$$.for financial years -and -an order to refund after assessments are finalized and an order for the payment of interest at the rate of % p.a. on the refund that is ordered. the high court of bombay after giving a thorough consideration dismissed the writ petition on the ground that once a particular $$$ is prescribed that constitutes the authoritative expression of the legislative will of parliament and the high court can not exercise its power of judicial review and go beyond the law enacted by the parliament and it is not permissible for the court to undertake a scrutiny of whether there was an error on the part of the parliament in legislating a particular rate of duty. further the high court observed that there is no discriminatory conduct which would compel the interference of the court. the $$$ unsatisfied with the order has preferred a revision before the high court which ended up in dismissal as no error apparent on record has been made out. in those circumstances the $$$ is before us by way of these appeals arising out of the original order and against the order passed in review. before this court the $$$ has amended the reliefs and sought for the following reliefs direct the respondents to perform their duty to issue suitable notification to rectify the erroneous rate of duty prescribed on sub -heading.and to implement and execute the tariff rate already legislated direct the respondents to return the excess amount of rs. collected without any authority of law direct the respondents to pay % simple interest for having willfully and deliberately refused to rectify the error. the $$$ has come up before this court with a voluminous record and made submissions at length. the gist of the and foremost grievance of the $$$ appears to be that he was charged with the duty @ rs. per litre or % which was already paid by him for the goods he imported as per the provisional assessment. according to him the finance minister has presented the budget proposals before the parliament which were duly approved by the parliament. as per the approved budget proposals the goods imported by him attracts reduction in duty % to % advalorem for -and % to % ad valorem for the year -and he does not fall under the exception of alcoholic beverages. the tariff he was charged and the tariff rates in the finance bill are contrary to the approved budget proposals. the grievance appears to be that whenever the tariff rates are erroneously prescribed the respondent is issuing notification and in fact they have issued notifications for $$$$ -and notifications for $$$$ -. the respondent is discriminating the $$$ by refusing to issue a circular in respect of his goods as such their action is discriminatory and violative of article of the constitution of india. in view of the aforesaid rival submissions the issues that fall for consideration are: whether the budget proposals as alleged by the $$$ are duly passed and approved by the parliament and whether the tariff rates fixed by the tru are contrary to the legislative mandate? whether this court can direct the central government to issue a notification under section of the customs act?3 whether the compound alcoholic preparations of a kind used for the manufacturing of beverages fall under the category of alcoholic beverage?4 whether there is any discrimination on the part of the central government in issuing a notification under section of the customs act in respect of other goods and contrary to article of the constitution of india?3. in re issue no. whole thrust of the $$$ is that the proposals of the finance minister were duly approved by the parliament. no doubt the $$$ has placed before this court the proposals of the finance minister which discloses the intention of the government but there is no material placed before us to demonstrate that the budget proposals are duly accepted by the parliament. it is an admitted fact that pursuant to the proposals the finance act was passed by the parliament wherein for the goods specified under tariff sub -heading.particular tariff was specified. we are unable to agree with the argument advanced by the $$$ for the reason that he is unable to make note of the difference between a proposal moved before the parliament and a statutory provision enacted by the parliament because the process of taxation involves various considerations and criteria.every legislation is done with the object of public good as said by $$$. taxation is an unilateral decision of the parliament and it is the exercise of the sovereign power. the financial proposals put forth by the finance minister reflects the governmental view for raising revenue to meet the expenditure for $$$$ and it is the financial policy of the central government. the finance minster 's speech only highlights the more important proposals of the budget. those are not the enactments by the parliament. the law as enacted is what is contained in the finance act. after it is legislated upon by the parliament and a rate of duty that is prescribed in relation to a particular $$$ that constitutes the authoritative expression of the legislative will of parliament. now in the present facts of the case as per the finance bill the legislative will of the parliament is that for the commodities falling under tariff head.the tariff is rs. per litre or % whichever is higher. even assuming that the amount of tax is excessive in the matters of taxation laws the court permits greater latitude to the discretion of the legislature and it is not amenable to judicial review.in view of the foregoing discussion we are unable to concur with the submission of the $$$ that the budget proposals are duly passed and approved by the parliament and moreover if the $$$ is aggrieved by the particular tariff prescribed under the finance act and the same is contrary to the approved budget proposals he ought to have questioned the same if permissible. hence this issue is answered against the $$$. in re issue no. is the case of the $$$ that in respect of other categories of the budgetary proposals several notifications were issued by the respondent altering the tariff rates but whereas in his case the respondent refused to issue such a notification and it is nothing but mala fide and corrupt practice on the part of the respondents. according to him the budget proposals passed and approved by the parliament are paramount and the executive or central government can not prescribe tariff rates contrary to the budget proposals and he finds fault with the way the respondent officials are functioning. a thorough look at the relevant provisions reveals that the source of power to issue notification by the central government relates to section of the customs act which reads as under power to grant exemption from duty.if the central government is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do it may by notification in the official gazette exempt generally either absolutely or subject to such conditions to be fulfilled before or after clearance as may be specified in the notification goods of any specified description from the whole or any part of duty of customs leviable thereon.if the central government is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do it may by special order in each case exempt from the payment of duty under circumstances of an exceptional nature to be stated in such order any goods on which duty is leviable.section of the act delegates power to the central government i. the executive branch to grant exemption generally from duty whenever it finds that it is necessary to do so in the larger public interest either absolutely or subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification or by a special order in each case under exceptional circumstances.as per section of the act any notification issued under section shall be placed before the parliament and the parliament may amend or reject the same. this clearly demonstrates that the ultimate law making power is vested with the legislature. hence the allegation of the $$$ that the notifications are issued basing on the whims and fancies of the respondent is misconceived. whereas notifications are issued generally in the larger public interest the legislature has given the power to exempt duty to the respondent subject to the amending power.in these circumstances it is not appropriate on our part to issue any orders directing them to issue a notification under section of the act except on the grounds of discrimination. in the matter of taxation the court gives a greater latitude to the legislative discretion. accordingly the issue is answered. in re issue no. regard to this issue whether the compound alcoholic preparations of a kind used for manufacturing of beverages fall under the category of alcoholic beverages ' the $$$ has relied upon a judgment of the bombay high court which was confirmed by this court and the learned senior counsel for respondents made several contra submissions relying on some judgments. according to us it is not for us to do this exercise. it is always open to the parties to settle the dispute before the appropriate forum if they choose to do so. the issue is accordingly answered. in re issue no.  to the $$$ the central government has issued notifications under section and he is also entitled to such a notification in respect of the commodities falling under the category. when the $$$ alleges discriminatory action on the part of the respondents he has to establish that there is no rational basis for making classification between the goods which are notified and the goods of the $$$ which are not notified. it is also a firmly established principle that the legislature understands and appreciates the needs of its people. a taxing statute can be held to contravene article of the constitution if it purports to impose certain duty on the same class of people differently and leads to obvious inequality. such a material is not placed before us to come to a just conclusion that the action of the respondents is discriminative. hence the same is held against the $$$. as far as the interest aspect is concerned when the $$$ is not entitled for the relief there is no need for us to express any opinion on the interest aspect. before we conclude we would like to record our appreciation for the strenuous efforts put forth by the $$$ and the kind of efforts he put in to collect the data. we feel that it is not out of place to mention that the $$$ has presented the case like a seasoned professional with utmost skill and knowledge. in view of the aforesaid elaborate discussion we reach to an irresistible conclusion that the appeals being devoid of any merit deserve to be dismissed and are dismissed accordingly. no costs.
