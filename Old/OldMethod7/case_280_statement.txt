n. $$$ j. a -judge $$$ of this court by an or$$$r dated.referred the above noted writ petitions for consi$$$ration by a $$$ of judges by the following or$$$r:"we have heard learned counsel. it appears that a $$$ of learned judges of this court has taken a view dissimilar to that taken by a $$$ of learned judges. it appears therefore that these matters should be heard and disposed of by a $$$ of learned judges and to the extent possible with expedition. $$$ facts necessary for the disposal of this case are as follows in the u.p. provincial medical services p.m.s.for a consi$$$rable length of time regular appointments were not ma$$$ and with a view to meet the need for doctors appointments were being ma$$$ on a temporary basis but in consultation with the state public service commission. these appointments were continued for $$$$ together without any interruption. in the respon$$$nt -state purported to regularize the services of these temporary doctors by the promulgation of u.p. regularization of ad hoc appointments on posts within the purview of the public service commission rules for short the regularization rules and sought to give these appointees seniority only from the date of their such regularized appointment un$$$r the rules. in the meanwhile in the year pursuant to the advertisements issued by the public service commission the said commission ma$$$ selections to fill the vacancies in the p.m.s. and recommen$$$d the names of certain selectees. such selections and recommendations seem to have been ma$$$ in installments between the year and. these selections ma$$$ by the public service commission were originally not acceptable to the state government but when they became acceptable because of certain judicial pronouncements or otherwise the question of inter se seniority arose between the temporary doctors originally appointed and the doctors appointed through the public service commission. it was the stand of the temporary doctors that they were appointed to permanent vacancies in consultation with the public service commission and having continued for a consi$$$rable length of time in service their original appointments ought to be $$$emed as regular and they should be given seniority from the date of their initial appointments. this claim of the temporary doctors being rejected temporary doctors approached the allahabad high court in separate writ petitions civil misc. w. p. no. filed by dr. h. c. $$$ was such petition. the high court of allahabad clubbing the petitions by its or$$$r dated.upheld the claim of the temporary doctors and held that their seniority should be counted from the date of their initial appointment in the p.m.s cadre and that they are also entitled to all the service benefits which are due to them after so fixing their seniority. the state of u.p. selectively filed an s.l.p. against the judgment of the high court in w. p. no. that is in the case of dr. h. c. $$$. the said matter came up before this court in s.l.p. c.no. before a -judge $$$ of this court which by its or$$$r dated.held $$$ have heard mr. d. v. sehgal senior counsel appearing for the state of u.p. the respon$$$nt in this special leave petition has served the state of u.p. for over years and he was regularized after he had put in more than years of service. relying upon the uttar pra$$$sh regulation of ad hoc appointments on posts within the purview of the public service commission rules the state of u.p. $$$clined to give him the benefit of years of service towards seniority. the allahabad high court allowed this writ petition and granted him the benefit of the whole of the period towards seniority. we see no infirmity in the judgment of the high court. we agree with the reasoning and the conclusions reached therein. special leave petition is dismissed. thus the judgment of the high court upholding the right of the temporary doctors to count their seniority from the date of their initial appointment came to be confirmed. it is on record that subsequent to that a number of other similarly situated temporary doctors also filed similar petitions and obtained similar relief out of which some cases were brought to this court by the state of u.p. like in w.p. no. which was $$$ci$$$d by this court in s.l.p. c.c.c. no. wherein the judgment of the high court was again confirmed by a division bench of this court on.. during the pen$$$ncy of some of the above noted petitions it is seen from the record that some of the selectee doctors who were not given letter of appointment by the state government approached the state service tribunal seeking a direction that they will be appointed in service in accordance with the selections and recommendations ma$$$ by the public service commission. the tribunal on those petitions passed the following or$$$r:"the references are allowed the or$$$r of state of u.p. whereby it has cancelled the selection list submitted to it by the public service commission u.p. contained in go. no. -dated.is quashed being illegal inoperative null and void and the petitirs are $$$clared entitled to get appointed subject of course to other consi$$$rations mentid in the body of judgment as medical officers in accordance with the said selection list of the commission and to get all the consequential service benefits. the opposite parties are directed to issue letter of appointment to the petitirs on the basis of selection list of.within months of this $$$cision and also gave all the consequential service benefits. the state of u.p. challenged the said or$$$r of the tribunal by way of w. p. no. which was heard by the high court along with other connected matters and the high court modified the or$$$r of the tribunal in the following terms:"in these circumstances the directions issued by the claim tribunal were totally justified. however in view of fact the recruitment was ma$$$ about years earlier and the persons who were appointed on ad hoc basis have been regularized during the last years it may not be proper to direct the appointment of all the selectees at this stage. however the claim of the petitirs who had been selected and are also working on ad hoc basis shall be $$$emed to have been appointed on the date when the vacancies were filled by the regularization by virtue of being selected by the public service commission and would be entitled to seniority and other benefits accordingly. the relief granted by the tribunal shall stand modified to that extent. it is seen from the above proceedings the basic question involved in those matters before the tribunal as well as before the high court was in regard to the inaction / refusal on the part of the state government in not issuing appointment letters to the petitirs. while consi$$$ring the said inaction of the government in issuing appointment letters to those selectee doctors the tribunal held that those doctors were entitled to the relief sought for by them. however the high court while confirming the said or$$$r of the tribunal confined the relief to only those persons who had approached the tribunal. against this judgment of the high court the state of u.p. came up in a batch of s.l. ps. in c.a. nos. -of. it is in this batch of civil appeals that a $$$ of this court by its or$$$r dated.held it is settled law that all ad hoc appointments ma$$$ $$$ hors the rules do not confer any right to permanency or seniority. they acquire the rights only from the date of their regular appointment according to rules.while so $$$claring the law which affected the seniority of the temporary doctors who were appointed much earlier than the selectee doctors the $$$ though noticed the judgment of the $$$ ma$$$ in s.l.p. c no.  did not further discuss this judgment nor did it in specific terms distinguish / overrule that judgment but procee$$$d to take a view which was directly opposed to the view taken by the $$$. that or$$$r of.came to be further modified by the same $$$ in i.a. nos. -etc. in c.a. nos. -of by its subsequent or$$$r dated.. by this or$$$r the court while holding that the benefits accrued to retired doctors should not be disturbed held that the inter se seniority between the doctors recruited through the p.s.c. and the doctors whose services were absorbed un$$$r the regularization rules should be $$$termined in accordance with rule of the said rules which in effect also ran counter to the judgment of $$$. the $$$ further upheld the contention of the selectee doctors that they could not be treated as junior to the non -selectee temporary doctors and directed the state government to give promotions in accordance with the regularization rules referred to hereinabove. it is imperative to notice the fact that the or$$$rs of the $$$ of this court were ma$$$ in appeals filed against the or$$$r of the high court confirming the directions issued by the service tribunal in regard to appointment of certain selectee doctors and was not in regard to any petition wherein the inter se rights of the temporary doctors and selectee doctors were directly in issue unlike the case of dr. $$$ $$$ci$$$d by a $$$ of this court. it is because of the consequent action taken by the state government based on the directions issued by $$$ of this court in the above -referred case that the petitirs herein have preferred the above noted writ petition un$$$r article of the constitution. this court issued rule in this case on.and during the course of hearing a $$$ of this court on.felt it necessary that all persons who are likely to be affected by the $$$cision in these writ petitions should be intimated of the pen$$$ncy of these petitions hence it directed the state of u.p. to issue a notice in $$$$ newspapers setting out that these writ petitions are being heard before this court and that those whose seniority is likely to be affected are entitled to come before this court and put forth their point of view including all those persons who are governed by earlier court or$$$rs. a similar circular to this effect was also directed to be sent to all district headquarters. pursuant to the above publication and circulars a large number of applications for impalements / intervention were received and the same have been listed for or$$$rs along with the above writ petitions. it is in this context noticing the conflict between the judgments of the $$$ and the $$$ this matter has been referred to a larger bench. even though the writ petitions themselves have been referred to this larger bench for final disposal we are of the opinion that we should initially $$$ci$$$ the question as to the existence of conflict between the judgments of the $$$ and the $$$ and the effect of such conflict if any and then $$$ci$$$ whether the writ petitions should be finally $$$ci$$$d by this bench or not. in that view of the matter we have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties to the limited extent of finding out whether there is any conflict between the judgment of $$$ and that of $$$ and if so what is the effect of judgments dated.and.of the $$$. on behalf of the writ petitirs it was conten$$$d that the issue in regard to date of counting of seniority of temporary doctors having been conclu$$$d by the $$$ $$$cision of this court in dr. $$$ 's case the same could not have been in any manner varied or altered to the $$$triment of that class of doctors who were similarly placed as dr. $$$ because that judgment $$$clared the rights of not only dr. h. c. $$$ but also that of the class of doctors similarly situated. they also contend that application of rule of the regularization rules was consi$$$red in dr. $$$ 's case and was held to be inapplicable by the high court which view was confirmed by the $$$ of this court therefore the $$$ could not have held that the said rule is applicable while counting the seniority of the temporary doctors. this argument is based on the doctrine of binding prece$$$nts which requires that a judgment of a larger bench should not be overruled or differed from by a coordinate $$$ much less by a bench of lesser strength. it is stated that the judicial discipline apart the judgments of this court have clearly laid down that a coordinate bench or a bench of lesser strength can not overrule a $$$cision ren$$$red earlier by another coordinate bench or a bench of larger strength. reliance was placed on the following judgments of this court union of india and another etc. v. $$$ $$$ad by l. rs. etc.manu / $$$/069/$$$$manu / $$$/069/$$$$ awc $$$ $$$c and $$$ and ors. v. pramod chandra patnaik and others manu / $$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc. it is also conten$$$d by the writ petitirs herein that the or$$$r of the bench was ma$$$ without issuing notice to the affected parties. per contra learned counsel appearing for the respon$$$nts -applicants contend that there is no conflict between the views taken by the $$$ and the $$$ supra. they submitted that as a matter of fact the subsequent or$$$rs of the $$$ are more in the nature of clarification than conflicting. they however agree that if there is any conflict then such view of the $$$ can not be sustained. we will now proceed to consi$$$r whether there is in fact any conflict between the sets of judgments. in this process we must bear in mind the fact that the judgment of this court in dr. $$$ 's case was a confirming judgment wherein this court upheld the findings of the high court by a reasd or$$$r though brief. therefore it becomes necessary to notice the basis of the judgment of the high court which was un$$$r appeal before this court in dr. $$$ 's case. in the said batch of writ petitions filed before the high court including that of dr. $$$ the high court held that appointments of temporary doctors were ma$$$ against substantive vacancies which had fallen vacant due to non -availability of doctors. it also held that the eligibility of the writ petitirs therein for being appointed as p.m.s.was not in dispute. it further held that the petitirs therein held the necessary qualification for regular appointment. from the records available before it the high court came to the conclusion that the petitirs therein had been working against substantive vacancies and were never treated as ad hoc appointees. it also held that the mere fact that their services were not regularized would not $$$ny those petitirs the benefit of their continuity in service from the date of their initial appointment and a subsequent regularization would not take away their right to seniority from the date of their initial appointment. it is on the basis of these findings that the high court directed to fix the seniority of the temporary doctors from the date of their initial appointment in the p.m.s. cadre giving them all the service benefits which were due to them after fixing their seniority. it was this judgment when brought before this court a $$$ upheld the same. it also noticed the fact that the regularization rules did not give them that benefit. still this court held that those doctors were entitled to count their service from the date of initial appointment for the purpose of counting their seniority. we have already noticed that this judgment has been successively followed in the subsequent cases of which at least came before this court and the said view of this court was affirmed. in the subsequent judgments of this court as noticed by us earlier the $$$ has held that ad hoc appointments ma$$$ $$$ hors the rules did not confer any right to permanency or seniority and that they acquire the right only from the date of their regular appointment according to the rules. it had further held that while those temporary doctors who had approached the high court and obtained directions from the court can count their seniority from the date of their initial appointment others meaning thereby those temporary doctors who have not approached the court but were similarly appointed could be given the seniority only from the date of their regularization under the rules. it is thus clear from the above referred observations in the judgment of the $$$ that while the $$$ upheld the right of temporary doctors similarly situated as dr. $$$ as a class to be entitled to count seniority from the date of their initial appointment by the subsequent judgment the $$$ has taken a different view by holding that temporary appointees can not claim seniority from the date of their initial appointment but can count the same only from the date of their regularization under rule of the regularization rules. this being the core issue involved in the dispute between the temporary doctors and selectee doctors in our opinion the $$$ has taken a directly conflicting view from that taken by the $$$. the question therefore for our consideration is how far this is permissible?9. the principles of the doctrine of binding precedent are no more in doubt. this is reflected in a large number of cases decided by this court. for the purpose of deciding the issue before us we intend referring to the following judgments of this court. in the case of union of india v. $$$ supra a $$$ of this court speaking through pathak c.j.held that pronouncement of a law by a division bench of this court is binding on another division bench of the same or smaller number of judges. the judgment further states that in order that such decision be binding it is not necessary that it should be a decision rendered by the full court or a constitution bench of the court. to avoid a repetition of the discussion on this subject we think it appropriate to reproduce the following paragraph of that judgment which reads as follows:"what then should be the position in regard to the effect of the law pronounced by a division bench in relation to a case raising the same point subsequently before a division bench of a smaller number of judges there is no constitutional or statutory prescription in the matter and the point is governed entirely by the practice in india of the courts sanctified by repeated affirmation over $$$$ of time. it can not be doubted that in order to promote consistency and certainty in the law laid down by a superior court the ideal condition would be that the entire court should sit in all cases to decide questions of law and for that reason the supreme court of the united states does so. but having regard to the volume of work demanding the attention of the court it has been found necessary in india as a general rule of practice and convenience that the court should sit in divisions each division being constituted of judges whose number may be determined by the exigencies of judicial need by the nature of the case including any statutory mandate relative thereto and by such other consideration which the chief justice in whom such authority devolves by convention may find most appropriate. it is in order to guard against the possibility of inconsistent decisions on points of law by different division benches that the rule has been evolved in order to promote consistency and certainty in the development of the law and its contemporary status that the statement of the law by a division bench is considered binding on a division bench of the same or lesser number of judges. this principle has been followed in india by several generations of judges. we may refer to a few of the recent cases on the point. in $$$ v. state of west bengal manu / sc/06/$$$$manu / sc/06/$$$$ scc a division bench of -judges found it right to follow the law declared in haradhan saha v. state of west bengal manu / $$$ / sc/09/$$$$ scc decided by a division bench of -judges in preference to bhut nath mate v. state of west bengal manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc decided by a division bench of -judges. again in $$$ v. raj narain manu / $$$ / sc/09/9 supp. scc beg. j.held that the constitution bench of judges was bound by the constitution bench of -judges in $$$ v. state of kerala manu / sc/0/9manu / sc/0/9 scc. in ganapati sitaram balvalkar v. waman shripad mage manu / sc/060/$$$$manu / sc/060/$$$$ scc this court expressly stated that the view taken on a point of law by a division bench of -judges of this court was binding on a division bench of -judges of the court. and in $$$ v. $$$ manu / sc/000/$$$$manu / sc/000/$$$$ scc this court specifically observed that where the view expressed by different division benches of this court could not be reconciled the pronouncement of a division bench of a larger number of judges had to be preferred over the decision of a division bench of a smaller number of judges. this court also laid down in acharya maharajshri narandraprasadji anandprasadji maharaj v. state of gujarat manu / sc/00/9manu / sc/00/9 scc that even where the strength of differing division benches consisted of the same number of judges it was not open to division bench to decide the correctness or otherwise of the views of the other. the principle was reaffirmed in union of india v. godfrey philips india ltd.manu / sc/006/986manu / sc/006/986 scc which noted that a division bench of judges of this court in $$$ v. state of haryana manu / $$$ / sc/0/980 scc had differed from the view taken by an earlier division bench of judges in motilal $$$ v. state of u.p.manu / sc/06/198manu / sc/06/198 scc on the point whether the doctrine of promissory estoppel could be defeated by invoking the defence of executive necessity and holding that to do so was wholly unacceptable reference was made to the well accepted and desirable practice of the later bench referring the case to a larger bench when the learned judges found that the situation called for such reference. almost similar is the view expressed by a recent judgment of $$$ of this court in $$$ 's case supra. in that case a bench of learned judges doubted the correctness of the decision of a bench of learned judges hence directly referred the matter to a bench of learned judges for reconsideration. in such a situation the judge $$$ held that judicial discipline and propriety demanded that a bench of learned judges should follow the decision of a bench of learned judges. on this basis the bench found fault with the reference made by the bench based on the doctrine of binding precedent. a careful perusal of the above judgments shows that this court took note of the hierarchical character of the judicial system in india. it also held that it is of paramount importance that the law declared by this court should be certain clear and consistent. as stated in the above judgments it is of common knowledge that most of the decisions of this court are of significance not merely because they constitute an adjudication on the rights of the parties and resolve the disputes between them but also because in doing so they embody a declaration of law operating as a binding principle in future cases. the doctrine of binding precedent is of utmost importance in the administration of our judicial system. it promotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. judicial consistency promotes confidence in the system therefore there is this need for consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in the decisions of this court. it is in the above context this court in the case of $$$ held that a pronouncement of law by a division bench of this court is binding on a division bench of the same or similar number of judges. it is in furtherance of this enunciation of law this court in the latter judgment of $$$ supra held that but if a bench of learned judges concludes that an earlier judgment of learned judges is so very incorrect that in no circumstances can it be followed the proper course for it to adopt is to refer the matter before it to a bench of learned judges setting out the reasons why it could not agree with the earlier judgment. if then the bench of learned judges also comes to the conclusion that the earlier judgment of a bench of learned judges is incorrect reference to a bench of learned judges is justified.emphasis supplied). we are in respectful agreement with the enunciation of law made by this court in the above noted judgments in $$$ and parija supra. applying the principles laid down in the above said cases we hold that the judgment of the bench of this court dated.as modified by the subsequent order dated.by the same bench does not lay down the correct law being in conflict with the larger bench judgment. if that be so the above writ petitions from which this reference has arisen will have to be decided de hors the law laid down by those judgments of the bench of learned judges. therefore having decided the issue that has arisen for our consideration we think it just that these writ petitions should now be placed before a bench of learned judges for final disposal. at this stage it is necessary to record the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents that the writ petitioners before us are not similarly placed as dr. mathur hence the benefit of the judgment of judge bench in dr. mathur 's case is not applicable to the writ petitioners. they also contend that the judgment in dr. mathur 's case runs counter to an earlier judgment of judge bench of this court in the case of state of u.p. and anr. v. dr. m. j. siddiqui and others manu / sc/0455/$$$$manu / sc/0455/$$$$ scc therefore it is contended that the claim of the writ petitioners herein should be considered independent of the judgment of bench in dr. mathur 's case. at this stage it is sufficient for us to say that we are not deciding the inter se rights of the petitioners and other respondents in these writ petitions or the correctness of the judgment of the bench in dr. mathur 's case. if any such argument is raised it will be considered in accordance with law by the bench which will be hearing these petitions. therefore we do not express any opinion on these questions. we also make it clear that we are not passing any orders on the impalement/ intervention applications pending in these petitions and those will be decided by the bench hearing these writ petitions on their merits. for the reasons stated above we hold that the judgments of this court dated.and.delivered by bench in c.a. nos. -do not reflect the correct declaration of law being in conflict with the judgment of the bench dated.in s.l.p. no. of we further direct that these petitions shall now be listed for disposal before a bench of learned judges. ordered accordingly.
