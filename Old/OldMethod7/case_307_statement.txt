$$$ j. this is a petition filed by $$$s invoking article of the constitution of india. they are members of the $$$ legislative assembly representing different constituencies. by a resolution of the assembly dated.members of the assembly including the $$$s have been suspended from the house for the remainder of the period of the then current session. the resolution suspended the members for allegedly obstructing the proceedings of the legislative assembly. $$$sequently a $$$ committee was constituted to inquire into whether the conduct of the members during the incident dated.amounted to a breach of privilege. the $$$ committee held that the actions of the $$$s were a breach of privilege and recommended the action to be taken against the $$$s. such a recommendation was passed by a resolution of the assembly dated.. through this resolution the $$$s were suspended for a period of days of the next session of the house. further it was resolved that the $$$s should not be paid their salaries or given other benefits which are due to them as members of the legislative assembly for the period of suspension. aggrieved by the same the $$$s filed the instant writ petition praying as follows issue a writ of order declaring the impugned resolution dated.passed in the $$$ legislative assembly as unconstitutional illegal null and void.issue a writ of order and strike down the suspension beyond the period.issue a writ of order and permit the $$$s to use the office and their residential premises.issue a writ of order and restore all benefits other than that which is connected with the house.issue a writ of certiorari calling for the records pertaining to the resolution of the $$$ legislative assembly dated.and.in awarding multiple punishments to the $$$s on the file of the respondent so as to quash the same.issue a writ of order declaring the proceedings of breach of privilege against the $$$ herein right from commencement of the proceedings by the respondent herein under rule of the $$$ legislative assembly framed under article of constitution of india to the subsequent proceedings carried out by the privilege committee under rule of the rules including the resolution of the house under rule dated.and.respectively are illegal failure to comply with the principles of natural justice perverse irrational and violative of the petitirs statutory right under the $$$ payment of salaries act.pass such other / further order as this hon'ble court may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the present case. all the petitirs are members of a political party known as $$$. the basic facts leading to the present writ petition are as follows on.the petitirs allegedly resorted to unruly conduct while the session was in progress. when the speaker directed the marshalls to evict $$$$ from the house because of the alleged unruly conduct the remaining petitirs ran to the speaker 's podium allegedly to attack the speaker. however they were prevented by the marshalls. $$$ the speaker passed an order suspending members of the legislative assembly belonging to the $$$ party from the assembly for the remainder of the session with immediate effect. such a decision was taken by the speaker allegedly in exercise of the power under rule of the $$$ assembly rules. the speaker also referred to the $$$ committee of this assembly the incident dated.to identify those members who attempted to assault the speaker and the watch and ward staff. the $$$ committee after an inquiry recorded a conclusion that the conduct of the petitirs was in breach of the privileges of the house and therefore recommended to the house that these petitirs be removed from the assembly for days from the commencement of the next session of the legislative assembly and also that during the said period the petitirs be not paid the salary and be given other benefits to which the members of the house are entitled. hence the writ petition. various submissions are made on behalf of the petitirs which can be summarized as follows:(i that the decision to suspend the petitirs not only for the current session in which the alleged breach of privilege occurred but also for a certain period of the next session is beyond the authority of the house and the speaker under article.the incidents which took place outside the premises of the legislative assembly could not form the basis for taking action on the ground that such incidents resulted in the breach of the privileges of the house.the non -supply of certain material video recording to the petitirs which was relied upon to record the conclusion that the petitirs are guilty amounted to denial of a reasonable opportunity and therefore noncompliance with the principles of natural justice vitiating the assembly resolution dated..the state legislature and the speaker do not have the authority to seize the office and the residential premises in the legislative hostel allotted to the petitirs by virtue of their membership in the legislative assembly. at the very threshold the petitirs were called upon to satisfy this court regarding the maintainability of the instant writ petition as for the maintenance of a writ petition under article the petitirs must demonstrate that there is an infraction of of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitirs under part iii of the constitution. the response of the $$$s is .that the $$$s ' fundamental rights guaranteed under $$$ and article of the constitution have been violated by the impugned resolution;( this court in the case of $$$ v. $$$ $$$ and ors. manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc examined the constitutionality of the proceedings of the speaker of $$$ in exercise of its jurisdiction under article of the constitution of india. therefore the present petition also is maintainable. we shall deal with the submission of the $$$s. the question whether a petition under article is maintainable to determine the legality of the action by legislative bodies against its members on the ground that they indulged in conduct which is in breach of the privileges of the house was never raised either by the respondents nor did the court go into that question in $$$ case. on the other hand it appears from the said judgment that this court was not only dealing with the writ petitions filed under article but certain transferred cases though exact details of those cases and from where they were transferred are not available from the judgment. in our opinion $$$ case is not an authority for the proposition that a writ petition such as the on hand is maintainable under article. the question must be examined independently. article of the constitution guarantees the right to move this court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of rights conferred by part iii of the constitution. article insofar as it is relevant for the present purpose reads as follows:. the right to move the supreme court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part is guaranteed.the supreme court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this part. the jurisdiction of this court under article in contradistinction to the jurisdiction of the high courts under article is limited. while the high courts in exercise of the jurisdiction under article can issue writs for the enforcement of any right conferred by part iii and for any other purpose the jurisdiction under article is only confined to the enforcement of the rights conferred under part iii of the constitution. this distinction is well recognised by this court in number of cases. therefore in order to maintain the present petition the question whether there is any breach of fundamental rights of the $$$s is required to be examined. it is argued on behalf of the $$$s that the impugned action is violative of the $$$s ' fundamental right of speech and expression guaranteed under article a and their fundamental right to carry on an occupation guaranteed under article. it is also the case of the $$$s that the alleged non -compliance with the requirement of the principles of natural justice in the process of enquiry into the alleged unruly conduct of the $$$s and award of the punishment is violative of article. it is also argued that the impugned action insofar as it deprives although for a limited period the $$$s of their salary and other facilities attached to their membership of the house is a violation of their fundamental right under article of the constitution. we proceed to examine the claim of the $$$s that by the impugned action their fundamental rights under $$$ and are violated. it is well settled now that the fundamental rights guaranteed under article are available only to the citizens of this country whereas the other fundamental rights under $$$ and are available to every person who is subjected to the laws of this country. the freedoms enumerated under article of the constitution inhere in all the citizens by virtue of their citizenship without the need for anything further. questions are required to be examined in the context when a member of a state legislature participates in the proceedings of the house is that member exercising a fundamental right of speech and expression under article whether any action either of that legislative body or any other authority acting pursuant to any law disabling either temporarily or otherwise a member from participating in the proceedings of the legislative body amounts to deprivation of the fundamental right to freedom of speech under article of such a legislator?7. to answer the above question a closer scrutiny of some of the provisions of the constitution is required. $$$ and are relevant in the context. these articles deal with the parliament and the state legislature respectively. they declare inter alia that there shall be freedom of speech in the said legislative bodies. $$$ and further declare that no member of either the parliament or the state legislature shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of any thing said in such legislative bodies or any committee thereof. it is clear from the scheme of these articles that the constitutional declaration of freedom of speech in the legislative bodies creates a constitutional right in favour of the members of such legislative bodies. such a freedom had its origin in the privileges of the house of commons. the dimensions and contours of such right are greatly different from the dimensions and contours of the fundamental right of speech and expression guaranteed under article.while the fundamental right of speech guaranteed under article inheres in every citizen the freedom of speech contemplated under $$$ and is not available to every citizen except the members of the legislative bodies though by virtue of the operation of other provisions of the constitution citizenship of this country is a condition precedent for acquiring the membership of the legislative bodies the constitutional right of free speech in the legislative bodies is not inherent to the citizenship but is to be acquired by getting elected to those bodies.the freedom of speech contemplated in $$$ and is available only during the tenure of the membership of those bodies. no citizen can be deprived of its citizenship and therefore the fundamental right under article is inalienable.the constitutional right of free speech under $$$ and is limited to the premises of the legislative bodies. whereas the freedom of speech under article has no such geographical limitations.while the freedom of speech guaranteed under article is subject to reasonable restriction that could be imposed by law which is compliant with the limitations specified under $$$ the right of free speech available to a legislator either under $$$ or is not subject to any such limitation that could be imposed by law. however such a freedom as it appears from the opening clauses of these articles is subject to other provisions of the constitution and to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of the legislative $$$. express limitation on such freedom is found under $$$ and which prohibit in express terms any discussion in the legislative bodies with respect to the conduct of any judge of supreme court or of the high court in the discharge of his duties. further $$$ and authorise the legislative bodies to make rules for regulating their procedure and the conduct of their business;therefore the scope and amplitude of the freedom of speech inhering in a citizen and available to a member of the legislative body are totally different. no citizen has a right to enter the legislative body and exercise his freedom of speech unless he gets elected to such a legislative body in accordance with law. no legislator would continue to enjoy the freedom of speech contemplated under $$$ and after the cessation of the membership of the legislative body. no doubt when a legislator is prevented from participating in the proceedings of the house during the currency of the membership by virtue of some proceedings taken against such a legislator there would be a curtailment of the legislator 's constitutional right of free speech in the house of which such legislator is a member. but such curtailment is sanctid by constitution in view of the fact that such a right is made subject to other provisions of the constitution the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of the legislative bodies. therefore we are of the opinion that though there is a curtailment of the $$$s ' right of free speech in the legislative assembly of $$$ to which they are entitled under article by virtue of the impugned order the said impugned order does not in the context violate the fundamental rights of the $$$s guaranteed under article. our view is fully supported by an opinion of this court in re under article of constitution of india manu / sc/00/manu / sc/00/ air sc which view was reiterated by a constitution bench in raja $$$ v. $$$ $$$ and ors. manu / sc//$$$$manu / sc//$$$$ scc and in p.v. $$$ v. state cbi / spe manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc. according to the $$$s the term occupation under article is of the widest amplitude and includes the office of a member of legislative assembly.for this proposition the counsel places reliance on paragraph of the t.m.a. pai foundation v. state of karnataka manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ scc..article confers on all citizens rights specified in $$$ -clauses a to g. the fundamental rights enshrined in $$$ -clause g of $$$ of article of the constitution are to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business. we are concerned here with the right to establish educational institutions to impart education at different levels primary secondary higher technical professional etc. education is essentially a charitable object and imparting education is in my view a kind of service to the community therefore it can not be brought under trade or business nor can it fall under profession. nevertheless having regard to the width of the meaning of the term occupation elucidated in the judgment of the hon'ble the chief justice the service which a citizen desires to render by establishing educational institutions can be read in occupation. this right like other rights enumerated in $$$ -clause g is controlled by $$$ of article. the mandate of $$$ is that nothing in $$$ -clause g shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes or prevents the state from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of right conferred by the said sub -clause and in particular nothing in the said sub -clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it relates to or prevents the state from making any law relating to the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or the carrying on by the state or by a corporation owned or controlled by the state of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise. therefore it may be concluded that the right of a citizen to run educational institutions can be read into occupation falling in $$$ -clause g of $$$ of article which would be subject to the discipline of $$$ thereof.in our opinion it does not in any way support the claim of the $$$ that the impugned action is violative of their fundamental right under article. to decide the correctness of the submission we need to examine both the etymological and contextual meaning of the expression occupation occurring in article. this court in $$$ v. new delhi municipal committee manu / sc/0/8manu / sc/0/8 scc had an occasion to examine the question and held;the guarantee under article extends to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business. profession means an occupation carried on by a person by virtue of his personal and specialized qualifications training or skill. the word occupation has a wide meaning such as any regular work profession job principal activity employment business or a calling in which an individual is engaged. trade in its wider sense includes any bargain or sale any occupation or business carried on for subsistence or profit it is an act of buying and selling of goods and services. it may include any business carried on with a view to profit whether manual or mercantile. business is a very wide term and would include anything which occupies the time attention and labour of a man for the purpose of profit. it may include in its form trade profession industrial and commercial operations purchase and sale of goods and would include anything which is an occupation as distinguished from pleasure. the object of using analogous and overlapping words in article is to make the guaranteed right as comprehensive as possible to include all the avenues and modes through which a man may earn his livelihood. in a nutshell the guarantee takes into its fold any activity carried on by a citizen of india to earn his living. the activity must of course be legitimate and not anti -social like gambling trafficking in women and the like.it can be seen that the essence of the right is to pursue an activity which enables a citizen to earn livelihood. in t.m.a. pai foundation supra this court held that"article employs expressions viz. profession occupation trade and business.. article uses the expressions so as to cover all activities of a citizen in respect of which income or profit is generated and which can consequently be regulated under article.the amplitude of the term occupation is limited by the economic imperative of livelihood generation. therefore all the activities contemplated under article are essentially activities which enable a citizen to generate economic benefits. the primary purpose and thrust of article is to generate economic benefit and to protect the fruits of 's labour. the right to contest an election to the legislative bodies established by the constitution is held not to be a fundamental right. therefore logically it would be difficult to accept the submission that the right to participate in the proceedings of the legislative bodies can be a fundamental right falling under article. no citizen is entitled as of right either to become or continue for the whole lifetime as member of a legislative assembly. acquisition of the membership depends on the decision of the electorate and is conferred by a process established by law. even after election the tenure is limited. fundamental rights do not come into existence upon the volition of others. they inhere in the citizens and are capable of being exercised independently without the need for any action or approval of others subject only to the restrictions imposed by law. any member of a legislative assembly holds office until such membership comes to an end by some process established by law. constitutional offices commencing from the office of the president of india are meant for and established for securing the goals adumbrated in the preamble to the constitution. each of these offices is a compnt in larger machinery established to make it possible for the people of this country to realise the goals indicated in the preamble of the constitution. any mtary benefit incidental to the holding of such offices is only to compensate for the time and energy expended by the holder of the office in the service of the nation. it is for this very reason that a member of a legislative assembly can not be treated as holding office for the purpose of eking out a livelihood. the economic underpinnings of an occupation under article and the transient and incidental nature of economic benefits flowing from the office of a legislator must inevitably lead to the conclusion that a member of the legislative assembly can not be treated as pursuing an occupation under article. we therefore reject the contention that the issue at hand involves the rights of the petitirs under article. coming to the question of violation of fundamental right under article of the petitirs the case of the petitirs is that by virtue of the impugned action the petitirs have been deprived of their salaries and other benefits incidental to the membership of the legislative assembly during the period of suspension and therefore it is violative of their fundamental right under article. no clear authority is cited before us nor any tenable submission is made to demonstrate that there is violation of article except a bare assertion. on the other hand in $$$ case it was argued that such depravation resulting from the expulsion of a member from the house would result in violation of the constitutional rights of the members of the parliament0 and therefore the expulsion would be bad. this court repelled the submission and held..in the present case where there is a lawful expulsion the members can not claim that the provisions relating to salaries and duration of the house create such rights for the members that would have supremacy over the power of expulsion of the house.in other words this court held that salary and other benefits to which the members of a legislative body are entitled to during their tenure are purely incidental to the membership and they do n't even create an independent and indefeasible constitutional right. therefore the question that the deprivation of such benefits amounted to deprivation of fundamental right under article does not arise at all. we now deal with the submissions of the petitirs that the impugned proceedings are violative of the fundamental right of the petitirs under article. according to the petitirs the said proceedings have been taken in violation of the principles of natural justice. it is settled law that the scope of judicial review in matters relating to action taken against members by the legislative bodies is limited. however it is likewise well settled that the non -compliance with the principles of natural justice is of the limited grounds on which judicial review could be undertaken against the internal proceedings of the legislative bodies in appropriate cases. we now examine the $$$s ' claim that there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice. it is rather difficult to cull out from the body of the clumsily drafted writ petition the counter is no better though very long the precise factual grievance of the $$$s. the substance we could cull out is that a copy of the videograph relied upon by the $$$ committee was not provided to them. from a reading of paragraphs.to.of the writ petition it appears that there was considerable correspondence between the $$$ committee and the $$$s. the $$$ committee called for an explanation from the $$$s herein as to why action could not be taken against them though it is not clear from the record as to the basis on which the $$$s were chosen out of the mlas who were suspended initially. each of the $$$s gave their explanation by separate letters. after consideration of the explanation the $$$ committee concluded that there was indeed breach of privilege and recommended action against the $$$s. this recommended action formed the basis of the assembly resolution dated.. it is argued before us that the $$$ committee relied upon certain video recordings for arriving at the conclusion that the $$$s are guilty of conduct which is in breach of the privileges of the house but a copy of the video recording was not provided to the $$$s. it is clear from the record that the video recording played a crucial role in the deliberations of the $$$ committee.upon viewing the recording of the incident dated.in which members belonging to the $$$ party were allegedly involved the $$$ committee reached a conclusion that the conduct of the $$$s is in breach of the privilege of the house. the proceedings of the $$$ committee make repeated references to video recording. fir no. cr. no. dated.filed by mr. $$$ a special sub -inspector deployed in the $$$ legislative assembly which is of the pieces of evidence used against the $$$s mentions the names of only of the $$$s $$$ no. and $$$ no. in his fir mr. vijayan makes an omnibus statement that all members belonging to the $$$ party rushed to the speaker 's chair in an unruly fashion and were ordered to be sent out of the house for that reason. he then proceeds to specifically state the accused $$$ no. and $$$ no. attacked him. in this light the question is how did the $$$ committee identify members as having breached the privilege of the house from the $$$ committee meeting it is clear that the only material relied upon by the committee to identify all the $$$s and recommend action against them for breach of privilege was the video recording. the $$$s ' case though not elegantly pleaded is that they have not been granted the opportunity to watch the video recording or comment on the content and authenticity of the video. in the questions of law raised in the writ petition the $$$s raised the question of whether denial of the right to comment on the video material would amount to breach of natural justice in the grounds taken by the $$$s they pray for the writ to be allowed because on the question of authenticity of videography and as to how far it can be pressed into service further the respondents never gave a copy of the alleged videography to the $$$. it is the case of the respondents that the disciplinary proceedings are not based solely on the video clippings. at para of the counter affidavit it is stated that the violent incidents on.had been witnessed by all members in the house including those in the $$$ committee and thus the videograph is not the sole basis for award of punishment. the of the $$$ committee meeting clearly show that the video -recording played an important role in arriving at the conclusions that the $$$ committee did. the video recording was specifically shown to the members of the $$$ committee since some of them would have forgot only the video recordings were shown again"5. giving some allowance for bad translation -the said sentence only indicates that the committee was not willing to rely solely on the memory of the members of the committee. at the risk of repetition we reiterate that the video recording served as the common factual platform for all the members of the $$$ committee from where the members discussed the actions of the $$$s and recommended action against them. this court in $$$ case while dealing with the question of the rules of natural justice in the context of proceedings in the legislative bodies held as follows as already noted the scope of judicial review in these matters is restricted and limited. regarding non -grant of reasonable opportunity we reiterate what was recently held in $$$ v. state of haryana that the principles of natural justice are not immutable but are flexible they can not be cast in a rigid mould and put in a straitjacket and the compliance therewith has to be considered in the facts and circumstances of each case. in $$$ v. state of haryana manu / sc/57/$$$$manu / sc/57/$$$$ scc this court discussed the scope of the principles of natural justice in the context of the proceedings in the legislature action under $$$ of the constitution and held thus undoubtedly the proceedings before the speaker which is also a tribunal albeit of a different nature have to be conducted in a fair manner and by complying with the principles of natural justice. however the principles of natural justice can not be placed in a straitjacket. these are flexible rules. their applicability is determined on the facts of each case.. the principles of natural justice require that the $$$s ought to have been granted an opportunity to see the video recording. perhaps they might have had an opportunity to explain why the video recording does not contain any evidence / material for recommending action against all or some of them or to explain that the video recording should have been interpreted differently. the $$$ committee should have necessarily offered this opportunity in order to make the process adopted by it compliant with the requirements of article. $$$ no. in his reply letter to the notice issued by the $$$ committee seeks permission to give further explanation when the video recording is provided to him. the $$$ no. in his reply letter states that he believes his version of his conduct will be proven by the video recording. the other $$$s do not mention the video recording in their reply letters. however it is not the $$$s ' burden to request for a copy of the video recording. it is the legal obligation of the $$$ committee to ensure that a copy of the video recording is supplied to the $$$s in order to satisfy the requirements of the principles of natural justice the failure to supply a copy of the video recording or affording an opportunity to the $$$s to view the video recording relied upon by the committee in our view clearly resulted in the violation of the principles of natural justice i. a denial of a reasonable opportunity to meet the case. we therefore have no option but to set aside the impugned resolution dated.passed in the tamil nadu legislative assembly. the same is accordingly set aside. the consequence of setting aside the impugned resolution of the tamil nadu legislative assembly dated.is that the salary and other benefits incidental to the membership of the assembly stand restored to the $$$s herein. in view of the conclusion recorded above we see no need to deal with the other submissions advanced by the $$$s. the writ petition is allowed as indicated above.gujarat state financial corporation v. lotus hotel manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ air sc scc air india statutory corporation v. united labour union manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$

freedom is subject to the provisions of this constitution and to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of parliament. the words subject to the provisions of this constitution have been construed to mean subject to the provisions of the constitution which regulate the procedure of parliament viz.$$$ and. see m.s.m. sharma v. sri krishna sinha scr at p. and special reference no. of also known as the legislative $$$ case scr at p.the freedom of speech that is available to members of parliament under article is wider in amplitude than the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under article since the freedom of speech under article is not subject to the limitations contained in article. by reason of $$$ -article of article members of parliament enjoy freedom of speech subject only to the provisions of the constitution and the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of parliament. that express provision is made for freedom of speech in parliament in $$$ -article of article suggests that this freedom is independent of the freedom of speech conferred by article and unrestricted by the exceptions contained therein. this is recognition of the fact that members need to be free of all constraints in the matter of what they say in parliament if they are effectively to represent their constituencies in its deliberations. $$$ -article of article puts negatively what $$$ -article states affirmatively. both $$$ -articles must be read together to determine their content. by reason of the part of $$$ -article no member is answerable in a court of law or any similar tribunal for what he has said in parliament. this again is recognition of the fact that a member needs the freedom to say what he thinks is right in parliament undeterred by the fear of being proceeded against. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxthe provisions of article therefore indicated that the freedom of speech referred to in $$$ -article thereof was different from the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under article a and could not be cut down in any way by any law contemplated by article. it will be noticed that the material clauses of article deal with different topics. $$$ makes it clear that the freedom of speech in the legislature of every state which it prescribes is subject to the provisions of the constitution and to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of the legislature. while interpreting this clause it is necessary to emphasise that the provisions of the constitution to which freedom of speech has been conferred on the legislators are not the general provisions of the constitution but only such of them as relate to the regulation of the procedure of the legislature. the rules and standing orders may regulate the procedure of the legislature and some of the provisions of the constitution may also purport to regulate it these are for instance $$$ and. the adjectival clause regulating the procedure of the legislature governs both the preceding clauses relating to the provisions of the constitution and the rules and standing orders. therefore $$$ confers on the legislators specifically the right of freedom of speech subject to the limitation prescribed by its part. it would thus appear that by making this clause subject only to the specified provisions of the constitution the constitution -makers wanted to make it clear that they thought it necessary to confer on the legislators freedom of speech separately and in a sense independently of article. if all that the legislators were entitled to claim was the freedom of speech and expression enshrined in article it would have been unnecessary to confer the same right specifically in the manner adopted by article and so it would be legitimate to conclude that article is not of the provisions of the constitution which controls the part of $$$ of article. having conferred freedom of speech on the legislators $$$ emphasizes the fact that the said freedom is intended to be absolute and unfettered. similar freedom is guaranteed to the legislators in respect of the votes they may give in the legislature or any committee thereof. in other words even if a legislator exercises his right of freedom of speech in violation say of article he would not be liable for any action in any court. similarly if the legislator by his speech or vote is alleged to have violated any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by part iii of the constitution in the legislative assembly he would not be answerable for the said contravention in any court. if the impugned speech amounts to libel or becomes actionable or indictable under any other provision of the law immunity has been conferred on him from any action in any court by this clause. he may be answerable to the house for such a speech and the speaker may take appropriate action against him in respect of it but that is another matter. it is plain that the constitution -makers attached so much importance to the necessity of absolute freedom in debates within the legislative chambers that they thought it necessary to confer complete immunity on the legislators from any action in any court in respect of their speeches in the legislative chambers in the wide terms prescribed by clause. thus clause confers freedom of speech on the legislators within the legislative chamber and clause makes it plain that the freedom is literally absolute and unfettered.powers privileges and immunities generally0. taking note of pandit sharma i it was reiterated in u.p. assembly case special reference no. of that clause of article no doubt makes a substantive provision of the said clause subject to the provisions of the constitution but in the context those provisions can not take in article because the latter article does not purport to regulate the procedure of the legislature and it is only such provisions of the constitution which regulate the procedure of the legislature which are included in the part of article.f / n supra.9paragraph. it was further argued by the $$$s that provisions in the constitution relating to salary and the term for which they serve in the house are constitutional rights of the members and the power of expulsion by terminating their membership violates these constitutional rights.singh v. state of haryana manu / sc/547/$$$$manu /
