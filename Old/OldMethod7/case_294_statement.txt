v. $$$ j. leave granted in the special leave petitions. the present appeals arise out of the impugned judgment and order dated.passed in $$$ nos. of and of by the high court of $$$ at bangalore whereby the high court dismissed the appeals filed by the $$$s thereby upholding the judgment and order of the learned single judge passed in $$$ nos. of and of setting aside order dated.passed in the revision petition no. cmw cap by the minister of cooperation on the ground that the revision petition filed by the $$$s herein is barred by limitation and is contrary to the provisions of section of the $$$ cooperative societies act hereinafter kcs act. though the case has a chequered history we refer to the facts in brief hereunder which are required to appreciate the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties the $$$s are small farmers who had availed a loan of rs. from the $$$ primary co -operative land development bank ltd. hereinafter the bank by mortgaging their entire immoveable agricultural property as security for the same. these lands were situated at sakkarepatna village of $$$ $$$ descriptions of which are stated hereunder in survey numbers and their measurements:. admittedly the $$$s initially were able to pay only installment of the loan and were not able to pay the subsequent installments. the respondent bank filed a petition before the arbitrator of co -operative societies chikmagalur district which was registered as a case in dispute d.t.c. -. the learned arbitrator passed an parte award in favour of the bank by his order dated.holding as under..it is hereby declared that the amount due to the petitir on account of principal and interest and costs calculated upto $$$$ of april is rs.-and that such amount shall carry interest at per cent per annum from the said date viz..until realization and it is hereby ordered that the said amount shall be recovered by sale of the schedule mortgaged properties or a sufficient part thereof and if the amount fell due with interest and costs is not realized by the said sale the balance shall be recovered from the respondents personally. the said sum may also be recovered from the sale of the moveable properties of the respondents.on.the bank conducted the auction sale of the immoveable property in public auctions and the bid stood at rs. being aggrieved of the award of the arbitrator as well as the sale of the property the $$$s filed an appeal before the $$$ appellate tribunal bangalore. during the pendency of the appeal the state government of $$$ issued a notification in respect of the borrowers of the bank which inter alia stated as under..it is hereby informed to the loan members of kadur taluk primary cooperative land development bank that as per the government order those members who have the balance by the end of june and special discount is given for the year -. on.those who had the balance applicable to the suit decreed loans also if the principal amount is paid in a single payment before.interest and compound interest will be completely exempted..pursuant to this offer the $$$ paid to the bank the entire remaining loan amount of rs. on.excluding the interest as he had already deposited an amount of rs. with the $$$ cooperative society on.. the learned $$$ appellate tribunal allowed the appeal filed by the appellants vide order dated.and remitted the matter back to the arbitrator to dispose of the same in accordance with law after giving proper notice to all the parties. challenging the said order of the tribunal the respondents filed a $$$ before the high court of $$$ which was allowed by its judgment and order dated.. the learned high court held on the issue of the appeal before the tribunal being barred by limitation as under while respondent- had filed his appeal -appeal no. of $$$$. every of the reasons on which those respondents sought of condonation of delay in filing their reading of the applications should have rejected that respondents and had not been served had condd the delay in filing the appeal. assuming that reason opinion particularly having regard to the fact that they were not other than the sons of respondent- who had appeared before the arbitrator and had consented for a decree sought by the society. i am somewhat distressed at the way the tribunal has dealt with the appeals and has condd the inordinate and inexplicable delay in filing the appeals. on the principles of regulating the condonation of delay the tribunal should have rejected their appeals also in limine. from this it follows that the order of the tribunal which suffers from manifest illegalities in exercise of its jurisdiction is liable to be quashed.on the issue of the order of the arbitrator being passed parte against the respondents therein the high court held as under an award / decree made against a person though he was not served in the proceedings is never considered as a decree made without jurisdiction. a decree or an award against a person who has not been served at the highest may be an irregularity and does not amount to a case of inherent want of jurisdiction nullifying such a decree on that ground. without any doubt the view taken by the tribunal that the award made by the arbitrator in to which respondent- consented was a valid award and there was hardly any ground for the tribunal to take exception to the same after $$$$ in the case of appeal and after $$$$ in the case of another appeal.setting aside the order of the tribunal the high court held on any view of the matter the order of the tribunal which suffers from errors of jurisdiction and illegality in the exercise of jurisdiction had occasid grave failures of justice to the petitir and respondents- and has d doubtful justice to respondents to is liable to be interfered with by me under $$$ and of the constitution. the $$$ preferred by the appellants against the order of the high court dated.was dismissed by the division bench of the high court vide judgment and order dated.. while upholding the findings of the learned single judge of the high court the division bench held as under in addition to this we have already noticed from the order sheet of the arbitrator produced as annexure -c that the notices were issued to the appellants and the service of summons on them was held as sufficient and the appellants were treated as parte. that being so the observation of the tribunal that the notices were not served upon the appellants is incorrect. in addition to this the tribunal has failed to see that the th respondent appeared and consented for a decree. the appellants and the th respondent were living together under roof. hence it is difficult to believe the version of the appellants that they were not aware of the award. all that can be said in the instant case is that the explanation as to the ignorance of the award proceedings is opposed to the realities of life. in the meanwhile on.the assistant registrar of cooperative societies issued a certificate of sale under rule of the $$$ cooperative societies rules hereinafter kcs rules in favour of the auction purchaser s.v. $$$ respondent no. herein thereby confirming the sale of the lands of the appellants herein. $$$ of the same the appellants preferred an appeal under section of the kcs act before the deputy registrar of the cooperative societies chikmagalur district. the appeal was dismissed by the deputy registrar vide order dated.. while dismissing the appeal the learned deputy registrar held as under the appellants have contended that the action of the assistant registrar of cooperative societies is contrary to law but they have not specifically mentioned or proved as to how the confirmation of sale is in violation of the k.c.s. act or contrary to rule of the k.c.s. act and the rules. therefore the order of confirmation of sale passed by the assistant registrar of cooperative societies is upheld and the appeal is dismissed. the appellants then filed a review petition under rule of the kcs rules challenging the order of confirmation of sale of the immoveable property passed by the assistant registrar of co -operative societies dated.which petition was dismissed as not maintainable vide order dated.on the ground that an appeal filed challenging the same had already been dismissed. $$$ of the same the appellants then preferred a revision petition under section of the kcs act before the deputy registrar of co -operative societies which was dismissed as not maintainable vide order dated.. the deputy registrar held as under this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the revision petition filed by the petitioner under section of the cooperative societies act. i am of the opinion that the revision petition is liable to be dismissed as not maintainable at the preliminary stage of admission.the appellants thereafter filed a revision petition under section of the kcs act before the minister of co -operation government of $$$. by order dated.the minister of cooperation allowed the revision petition filed by the appellants and set aside the order of sale confirmation dated.as well as the orders of appeal dated.and order of review dated.. it was held by the minister as under..i am of the opinion that the matter has not been dealt with in a just manner by the appellate authority. the subsequent action of the petitioners in filing appeals before the jrcs have all been exercised in futility because the matter was not given thought on merits all along by the authorities. if it was the claim of the petitioners that they have managed to repay a substantial part of the loan i. the principal amount before the specified date as in the circular dated.and that therefore they have complied with the condition as laid out in the circular it must have been the duty of the appellate authorities to examine the said contentions and then decide the matter keeping in mind the conditions of the said circular. the issue to be decided here is whether the petitioners claim to the interest waiver and consequent benefits are reasonable and tenable...it is seen that the amount of loan overdue is not really huge. yet the sale officer thought it fit to auction acre and guntas of land to recover a sum of rs. with interest. the sale was accepted for an offer of rs....... from the above arguments it is seen that the sale officer arcs and drcs all along have latched on to technical considerations and have not analysed the matter objectively. it appears that their approach has been rather narrow and such long drawn litigation could have been avoided had the authorities thought in a more rational manner instead of going into avoidable technicalities. i am of the opinion that the drcs should have examined the facts and circumstances of the auction sale in the appeals before him and decide the matter. available facts indicate that such an effort was not made and the matter went into litigation for $$$$. while i am aware the auction sale was held in it is unfortunate that not enough efforts have been made by the authorities to see the case at hand in an objective manner and the facts have not been analysed with respect to the benefit of interest waiver ordered by the state government that was intended to reach the needy farmer. in my opinion the conditions of loan default that prevailed then with these petitioners were surely coming within the ambit of the conditions stipulated in the circular dated.which is based on a government order it would be appropriate to make all efforts to see that such a benefit reached the persons to whom it was intended to reach in the place..emphasis laid by this court). the auction purchaser respondent no. herein challenged the aforementioned order of minister of cooperation dated.passed in the revision petition by way of filing $$$ no. of before the high court of $$$. the state government of $$$ also challenged the order by way of filing $$$ no. of. the learned single judge by a common judgment and order dated.quashed the order of the minister dated.. the learned judge held that the order passed in the revision petition was perverse and arbitrary. it was further held that the benefit of the circular dated.was only for the exemption of the interest and that the same would not enable the government to set aside the auction of the land which was conducted and confirmed in $$$$. it was further held by the learned single judge that in any case the said circular was not at all applicable when the property was transferred to a party. the appellants preferred $$$ no. of c w writ appeal no. of questioning the correctness of the order dated.passed in $$$ no. of etc. the high court dismissed the appeals and held that the revision petition filed before the minister under section was barred by time. the learned high court held as under from a reading of the provisions of section it is clear that suo motu the government may at anytime exercise the power of revisions or if it is at the instance of the party within months. in the instant case the revision petition was filed by the appellants. therefore the appellants were required to file a revision petition within months from the date of confirmation of the same since the sale is confirmed in. the appellants could not have filed a revision in years after the orders of confirmation. even if it is held that suo moto at any time the government can exercise the powers of revision then also it has to be exercised within a reasonable time not beyond $$$$ years..viewed from any angle the revision petition allowed by the hon'ble minister was clearly barred by time and the same is contrary to section of the act.the division bench of the high court held that no ground for interfering with the order of the single judge is made out and the appeals were dismissed. hence the present appeals. we have heard the learned counsel for both the parties. on the basis of the factual evidence on record produced before us the circumstances of the case and also in the light of the rival legal contentions urged by the learned counsel for both the parties we have broadly framed the following points which require our attention and consideration:. whether the revision petition filed before the minister for co -operation is barred by time in light of the provisions of section of the $$$ cooperative societies act. whether the interest of the auction purchaser is protected on grounds that he is a bona fide party?. what order?answer to point no. the litigation in this case has been quite lengthy which has seen multiple hearings before multiple forums. the controversy arose in the case when the learned arbitrator passed the -parte order dated.against the appellants. the $$$ appellate tribunal set aside the same vide order dated.. the $$$ high court in $$$ no. of set aside the order of the $$$ appellate tribunal by its judgment and order dated.. on the basis of the judgment in the above mentioned $$$ the respondent bank confirmed the sale of the land of the appellants vide certificate dated.. the appeal filed against the confirmation of sale was rejected by the deputy registrar of cooperative societies vide order dated.. a revision petition was then filed before the wrong forum which was rejected. then a revision petition under section of the kcs act was filed before the minister for cooperation state government of $$$. the minister allowed the revision petition and set aside the confirmation of the sale of the land of the appellants in favour of the auction purchaser. the said order of the minister was set aside by the learned high court. to appreciate the controversy in the instant case it is imperative for us to examine the provisions of the kcs act. the kcs act $$$ act no. of was enacted with the aim of providing a uniform co -operative societies law as applicable to the whole of the state of $$$. the rural development $$$ are conferred the power to advance loans in terms of section of the kcs act which reads as under:8a. powers of land development $$$ to advance loans and to hold lands.to the provisions of this act and the rules made thereunder it shall be competent for the agriculture and rural development $$$ to advance loans for the purposes referred to in section and to hold lands the possession of which is transferred to them under the provisions of this chapter.$$$ of the kcs act pertains to execution of awards decrees orders and decisions. section of the kcs act deals with enforcement of charge as under:. enforcement of charge.-notwithstanding anything contained in chapter ix or any other law for the time being in force but without prejudice to any other mode of recovery provided in this act the registrar or any person subordinate to him empowered by the registrar in this behalf may on the application of a cooperative society make an order directing the payment of any debt or outstanding demand due to the society by any member or past or deceased member by sale of the property which is subject to a charge under sub -section of section.chapter xiii of the kcs act pertains to appeals review and revision.section of the kcs act provides for appeals to the tribunal:0. appeals to the tribunal.person aggrieved by,--..any award of an arbitrator under clause c of sub -section of section..may within days from the date of the decision award or order as the case may be appeal to the tribunal.section of the kcs act confers powers of revision on the state government as under:08. powers of revision of state government. -subject to the provisions of section the state government suo moto at any time and on application of any person aggrieved within $$$$ months from the date of any order may call for and examine the record of any case or proceedings of any officer subordinate to it except those subject to appeal or revision by the tribunal or those in respect of which an appeal has been made to the state government under section and the state government after such enquiry as it deems fit is satisfied that the order of the officer is contrary to law and has resulted in a miscarriage of justice pass such orders thereon as the state government deems just provided that no order shall be made to the prejudice of any person under this section unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.emphasis laid by this court)since section is at the heart of the controversy in the instant case it is important to examine it in close detail. it confers upon the state government the power of suo moto revising the order of the tribunal. it is pertinent to note that no time limit has been set for the same. the provision confers the power upon the state government in case the order of the tribunal is contrary to law and has resulted in miscarriage of justice. mr. s.n. bhat the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no. the auction purchaser vehemently contends that the limitation period prescribed for filing revision petition by the appellants under section of the act is months. it is further contended that in the instant case the petition was unduly delayed and that the appellants had not even filed an application for condonation of delay before the minister. the learned counsel further placed reliance upon the judgment and order of the learned single judge of the $$$ high court in writ petition no. of c w writ petition no. of wherein the order of the minister in the revision petition was set aside. the learned judge had observed as under..it is clear from the perusal of the order passed by the respondent that no suo moto power has been exercised and order has been passed in the basis of the revision filed by respondents to and the said revision has not been filed within months..the learned counsel has placed reliance upon the decision of this court in v.n. $$$ dr.v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/088/00 scc to contend that a statutory authority has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition beyond the period prescribed for presenting the petition unless an application for condonation of delay is filed. the learned counsel further contends that even in cases where no limitation period has been prescribed for exercising the revision power it must be exercised within a reasonable period of time. the learned counsel places reliance upon the cases of state of gujarat v. patil $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc and $$$ patil and ors. v. balasaheb tukaram shevale and ors. $$$ / sc/8/$$$$$$$ / sc/8/$$$$ scc. the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants mr. h. chandra shekhar on the other hand contends that the high court erred in setting aside the order of the minister of co -operation government of $$$ in the revision petition on the ground that it was barred by limitation. the learned counsel places reliance upon the case of collector land acquisition $$$ and $$$. v. $$$. katiji and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc wherein this court has laid down the following principles to be applied while condoning delay:. ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late. refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated as against this when delay is condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits after hearing the parties. every day 's delay must be explained does not mean that a pedantic approach should be made. why not every hour 's delay every 's delay the doctrine must be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner. when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side can not claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non -deliberate delay. there is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately or on account of culpable negligence or on account of mala fides. a litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. in fact he runs a serious risk. it must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so.the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants further contends that section of the kcs act empowers the state government to examine the legality of the order under revision and also to prevent miscarriage of justice. the scope of revisional jurisdiction depends on the language of the statute providing revision. we have heard the learned counsel for both the parties. we are unable to agree with the contentions advanced by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no. this case is a classic example to demonstrate the gross miscarriage of justice that occurs when the principles of natural justice are ignored for technical considerations. the appellants in the present case are poor farmers who have been made to litigate for nearly decades for their land which was their only source of income and livelihood which right is guaranteed to them under article of the constitution of india. the award of the arbitrator dated.was passed parte against the appellants. the circular dated.issued by the $$$ state cooperative land development bank on the basis of the government order stated that the farmers who had become defaulters as on.to the taluk co -operative land development $$$ in the state and continued being defaulters upto.could repay the principal amount to such $$$ then in such cases the state government would bear the burden of the entire portion of the interest on such loans on behalf of the farmers and reimburse the same to such respective $$$. as is evident from the letter annexure p the appellants had repaid the entire principal amount within the date specified in the circular which fact has not been contested by the respondents. the auction sale of the property in question was conducted on.and the confirmation of the sale was ordered on.without considering the relevant fact of repayment of principal amount due to the bank within the time stipulated in the notification issued by the bank referred to supra. the appellants had informed the bank regarding the repayment of loan on.. the appellate authority has not considered the claim of the appellants on merit. the high court of $$$ in writ petition no. of set aside the order of the $$$ appellate tribunal dated.on the ground that the appeal before the tribunal was barred by limitation. the writ appeals filed by the appellants were also dismissed. the confirmation of sale of the property in question was done on the basis of the order in the above mentioned writ petition. the same was challenged by the appellants before the deputy registrar of co -operative societies who dismissed it on the ground that the appellants have not proved how the confirmation of sale is contrary to the provisions of the kcs act despite the fact of the repayment of the loan amount to the bank being brought to his notice. the order of the minister of co -operation government of $$$ in the revision petition setting aside the confirmation of sale was set aside by the learned single judge of the $$$ high court on the ground that it was barred by limitation. the same was upheld by the division bench in the writ appeals. the reliance placed by the learned counsel for the respondents on the case of v.n. $$$ referred to supra is misplaced as that case pertained to the consumer protection act and the powers of the district consumer $$$ therein. section of the consumer protection act provides a limitation period of years for filing a complaint and the proviso expressly bars the national commission from entertaining delayed complaints unless reasons for condonation of delay are provided. the learned counsel placed reliance on the following paragraph of the said judgment:. section contains a negative legislative mandate against admission of a complaint which has been filed after years from the date of accrual of cause of action. in other words the consumer forums do not have the jurisdiction to entertain a complaint if the same is not filed within years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen. this power is required to be exercised after giving opportunity of hearing to the complainant who can seek condonation of delay under section by showing that there was sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within the period prescribed under section. if the complaint is per se barred by time and the complainant does not seek condonation of delay under section the consumer forums will have no option but to dismiss the same..the learned counsel on behalf of respondent no. contends that statutory authorities in general do not have the right to condone delay without an application for condonation of delay whereas it is clear that the said judgment was to apply only to consumer forums and the same has no application to the facts of the instant case. the reliance placed by the learned counsel on the case of santoshkumar patil referred to supra is also misplaced. it was observed in that case as under it seems to be fairly settled that if a statue does not prescribe the time limit for exercise of revisional power it does not mean that such power can be exercised at any time rather it should be exercised within a reasonable time. it is so because the law does not expect a settled thing to be unsettled after a long lapse of time. where the legislature does not provide for any length of time within which the power of revision is to be exercised by the authority suo moto or otherwise it is plain that exercise of such power within reasonable time is inherent therein.emphasis laid by this court)if a statute does not prescribe the time limit for exercise of revisional power it must be exercised within a reasonable time frame. in the instant case it is evident that constant litigation has been carried on by the appellants and therefore they can not be accused of suddenly waking up after years to claim their land. further in the context of limitation it has been held by this court in a catena of cases that when what is at stake is justice then a technical or pedantic approach should not be adopted by the courts to do justice when there is miscarriage of justice caused to a public litigant. a judge bench of this court in the case of state of haryana v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/04/$$$$$$$ / sc/04/$$$$ scc has held as under the doctrine must be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner. when substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side can not claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non -deliberate delay. there is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately or on account of culpable negligence or on account of mala fides. a litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. in fact he runs a serious risk. judiciary is not respected on account of its power to legalise injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so.more recently a judge bench of this court observed in the case of $$$ dead through l.rs. v. state of haryana and ors. scc as under:..the substantive rights of the appellants should not be allowed to be defeated on technical grounds by taking hyper technical view of self -imposed limitations... further section of the kcs act confers the power on the state government to pass any order as it may deem fit in case there has been a miscarriage of justice. the instant case falls squarely within the ambit of section of the kcs act. the appellants have been rendered landless for more than decades even after repaying the loan amount. if this does not amount to gross miscarriage of justice caused to the appellants we do not know what does. in the instant case the fact of repayment of the principal loan amount to the bank before the confirmation of the auction sale shows that confirmation of the auction of the immoveable property was grossly illegal. the said sale was in contravention of the notification issued by the state government of $$$ in respect of the borrowers of the bank which sought to waive off the interest on the principal amount if the same was paid by.. the said notification was issued on the basis of a government order traceable to article of the constitution of india. therefore we have recorded the finding that the sale of the property and the confirmation of the auction sale is contrary to the notification referred to supra and law and has resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice. the action of the sale officer has resulted in the deprivation of the right to livelihood of the appellants who are small landowners guaranteed to them under article of the constitution of india. the right to livelihood has been held to be an integral part of right to life most notably in the landmark judgment of this court rendered in the case of $$$ v. bombay municipal corporation $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc wherein it has been held as under:..an equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because no person can live without the means of living that is the means of livelihood. if the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life the easiest way of depriving a person his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation. such deprivation would not only denude the life of its effective content and meaningfulness but it would make life impossible to live. and yet such deprivation would not have to be in accordance with the procedure established by law if the right to livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to life. that which alone makes it possible to live leave aside what makes life livable must be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life. deprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life. indeed that explains the massive migration of the rural population to big cities. they migrate because they have no means of livelihood in the villages. the motive force which people their desertion of their hearths and homes in the villages that struggle for survival that is the struggle for life. so unimpeachable is the evidence of the nexus between life and the means of livelihood. they have to eat to live only a handful can afford the luxury of living to eat. that they can do namely eat only if they have the means of livelihood..emphasis laid by this court). in the instant case the deprivation of the land of the poor appellants resulted in the deprivation of their livelihood as well. the courts below in the instant case which dismissed the claim of the appellants on technical grounds grossly erred and we can not uphold the same. the high court has erred in setting aside the order of the minister of co -operation government of $$$ passed in the revision petition on the ground that it was barred by limitation which approach of the high court is highly pedantic and technical and therefore the same can not be allowed to sustain in law. further section of the kcs act confers the power of revision on the state government suo moto at any time or on application by an applicant within months of the passing of an order. the kcs act is a special legislation. thus by virtue of section of the limitation act the power to condone delay is available with the state government. the contention of the auction purchaser that no such application for condonation of delay of the belated revision petition has been filed by the appellants is a hyper technical one and can not be sustained. where the state government has exercised its statutory power under section of the kcs act after satisfying itself that the sale of the mortgaged immoveable property of the appellants in the public auction is illegal it is not open for the respondents to contest the same by urging technical grounds especially in light of the fact that the power conferred upon the state government under section of the kcs act is suo moto and the same can be exercised at any time. therefore having regard to the facts of the case in the absence of an application for condonation of delay we hold that the exercise of the power by the minister for co -operation state government of karnataka must be taken as a suo moto exercise of power by him.answer to point no. it was next contended by mr. s.n. bhat the learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no. the auction purchaser that the interest of the auction purchaser should be protected as he is a bona fide party who purchased the land at the auction. the learned counsel places reliance on the decision of this court in the case of $$$ and ors. v. tax recovery officer and $$$. $$$ / sc/670/$$$$$$$ / sc/670/$$$$ scc wherein this court has held that the rights of a bona fide auction purchaser must be protected and that his title is saved even if the decree is set aside. we are unable to agree with the above contention of the learned counsel on behalf of the auction purchaser. the auction purchaser in our opinion is not a bona fide purchaser. section of the kcs act sets down the procedure of sale which provides as under:8. power of sale when to be exercised.notwithstanding anything contained in the transfer of property act central act iv of where a power of sale without the intervention of the court is expressly conferred on the agriculture and rural development bank by the mortgage deed the committee of such bank or any person authorized by such committee in this behalf shall in case of default of payment of the mortgage money or any part thereof have power in addition to any other remedy available to the bank to bring the mortgaged property to sale without the intervention of the court.no such power shall be exercised unless and until,--(a the board has previously authorized the exercise of the power conferred by sub -section after hearing the objections if any of the mortgagor;(b notice in writing requiring payment of such mortgage money or part has been served the any person who has any interest in or charge upon the property mortgaged or in or upon the right to redeem the same;(iii any surety for the payment of the mortgage debt or any part thereof and(iv any creditor of the mortgagor who has in a suit for the administration of his estate obtained a decree for sale of the mortgaged property and(c default has been made in payment of such mortgage money or part thereof for months after such service.thus it is imperative that the notice of the sale to be served on the mortgagor and the opportunity be given to him to file his objections. in the instant case the award of the arbitrator dated.ordering the sale of land was passed parte and the appellants were not provided any opportunity to produce their defence and objections to the same. further it is an admitted factual position that the appellants had repaid the principal loan amount as on.itself. the confirmation of the auction sale was ordered on.. it was upon the auction purchaser to assess the circumstances in which the auction of the property was being conducted. rule of the kcs rules which pertains to attachment and sale of immoveable property provides as under:. attachment and sale of immoveable property-...proclamation of sale shall be published by affixing a notice in the office of the recovery officer and the taluka office at least days before the date fixed for the sale land also by beat of drum in the village on consecutive days previous to the date of sale and on $$$$ of sale prior to the commencement of the sale. such proclamation shall where attachment is required before sale be made after the attachment has been effected. notice shall also be given to the applicant and defaulter. the proclamation shall state the time and place of sale and specify as fairly and accurately as $$$ the property to be sold,(ii any encumbrance to which the property is liable;(iii the amount for the recovery of which sale is ordered and(iv every other matter which the sale officer considers material for a purchaser to know in order to judge the nature and value of the property.further the fact that the actual auction sale had been conducted on.will also not come to the rescue of the auction purchaser as it has been held in the case of $$$ and co. v. official liquidator of $$$ product gujarat ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/3408/$$$$$$$ / sc/3408/$$$$ scc as under in the case mentioned above i. where the auction is not subject to confirmation by any authority the auction is complete on $$$$ of the hammer and certain rights accrue in favour of the auction -purchaser. however where the auction is subject to subsequent confirmation by some authority under a statute or terms of the auction the auction is not complete and no rights accrue until the sale is confirmed by the said authority.emphasis laid by this court)3. the confirmation of the sale happened only on.which was after the principal loan amount had been repaid by the appellants in compliance of the notification issued by the bank. in light of the facts of the present case the rights of the auction purchaser can not be protected as he can not be said to be a bona fide purchaser.answer to point no. in view of the reasons mentioned supra we are of the view that the confirmation of auction sale of the immoveable property in question was illegal. the learned high court erred in setting aside the order dated.of the minister for cooperation state government of karnataka passed in the revision petition. the same is erroneous and liable to be set aside. accordingly we pass the following order the civil
