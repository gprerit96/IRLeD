tariff and the tariff as per cerc norms for tariff on cost plus basis on the such terms and condition as this hon'ble court deems fit as just and proper;however prayer a was not pressed when the matter was taken up for hearing. a brief background of the appeal and the application is as follows. the $$$ company is a power generating company. the nd respondent herein is a company owned by the state of gujarat carrying on business of purchasing power in bulk from power generating companies such as the $$$ herein and supplying to various distributing companies in the state of gujarat. the $$$ and the nd respondent entered into a power purchase agreement hereinafter ppa for short. under the said agreement the $$$ is obliged to sell megawatt of power from the $$$ 's power project. for various reasons the details of which are not necessary at this stage the $$$ issued a notice of termination dated.of the above mentioned ppa w.f... after some correspondence the nd respondent filed a petition before the gujarat electricity regulatory commission the 1st respondent herein seeking adjudication of the dispute arising out of termination of the ppa by the $$$. the 1st respondent by its order dated.set aside the termination notice sent by the $$$ and directed the $$$ to supply power to the nd respondent as per the terms of the ppa. aggrieved by the said order the $$$ carried the matter in appeal before the appellate tribunal for electricity unsuccessfully. hence the appeal no. the appeal was admitted by an order dated.and since pending. hence the instant application with averments as $$$. if the relief sought for by the $$$ is not granted there is a serious risk of mundra power project becoming a non performing asset causing an irreparable harm to the consumers as well as the lenders of the mundra power project. since the main civil appeal is pending adjudication for final hearing and the $$$ is supplying the power to the respondent no. the present application is being filed to compensate the $$$ upto the actual cost of generation as per cerc norms for determination of tariff. the same is in order to sustain the generation and supply of power pending the hearing of the main civil appeal.xxx. it is submitted that whereas the pendency of the present appeal is piling huge losses upon the $$$ no prejudice would be occasioned to the respondents if the present application is allowed on an undertaking by the $$$ to refund the amount over and above the ppa tariff that will be paid to the respondent no. or such other condition as this hon'ble court may deem fit. alternatively in view of the recurring losses the $$$ be permitted to suspend further supply of electricity in terms of the ppa during the pendency of this appeal. this shall meet the ends of justice. on behalf of $$$$ an affidavit dated.is filed. the said affidavit while contesting the various assertions made by the $$$ and its rights stated:. i submit that without prejudice to the rights of the respondent no. to contest the present appeal the answering respondent with the approval of government of gujarat has already shown its willingness to pay compensatory tariff prospectively from $$$$ of cerc order i. march subject to paras and above to resolve the issue by making suitable adjustments in tariff which till date is not implemented because of non acceptance by $$$ and other stakeholders. i say that without prejudice to its rights in the present appeals the respondent no. is willing to implement the decisions of state govt. for paying compensatory tariff prospectively from $$$$ of cerc order i. march to resolve the issue by making suitable adjustment in tariff on the directions of the hon'ble court. xxx8. shri prashant bhushan learned counsel appearing for respondent no. opposed the prayers of the applicant alleging that the respondent is colluding with the $$$ as there is no occasion for the respondent to make any concession such as the one made in the affidavit filed by the respondent the relevant portion of which are already extracted above. more particularly when the respondent succeeded before fora below the concession of the respondent to pay compensatory tariff to the $$$ though said to be subject to the contentions of the respondent in the appeal is nothing but largesse of the state to the $$$ and not consistent with public interest. he further submitted that this court may not affix a stamp of approval for such a decision of the respondent by passing any order accepting the concession made by the respondent. he also submitted that the payment of compensatory tariff to the $$$ would ultimately result in compelling the consumers to pay higher price. on the other hand shri harish salve learned senior counsel for the $$$ denied the allegations of collusion between the $$$ and $$$$ respondent. he argued that the decision of $$$$ respondent is supported by a decision of the state of gujarat on an assessment of the subsequent developments. he submitted that compelling the $$$ to supply energy in terms of the ppa is bound to financially destroy the $$$ company and therefore prayed that $$$$ respondent be permitted to make the payment in terms of his concession. a ppa is a contract between the parties and the terms of any contract are nothing but the agreed terms of the contracting parties. it is also a settled principle of the law of contracts that parties to a contract can alter the terms of the contract subsequent to the formation of the contract by mutual consent. however the rights of the state and its agencies and instrumentalities in the realm of contracts are circumscribed by the considerations of public interest. apart from such general principle the rights and obligations of the parties to the ppa in question are also subject to certain statutory prescriptions. the questions whether the $$$ is entitled to terminate the ppa and if so on what terms and conditions are to be examined in the appeal. independent of such right if any of the $$$ if the parties to the ppa are agreeable to alter the terms of the ppa as indicated in the counter for whatever reasons whether such a variation is consistent with the requirements of the statutes applicable to the contract is a separate question. whether such a variation is consistent with the larger public interest is altogether a different question. an ancillary question arises whether such an issue can be properly the subject matter of the instant appeal. all these matters require a detailed examination as and when the appeal is taken up for hearing. coming to the question whether $$$$ respondent be directed to pay the $$$ compensatory tariff as indicated in its counter we are of the opinion no direction can be given at this stage during the pendency of the appeal as the right of the $$$ for such compensatory tariff appears to be of the issues in the appeal. in so far as the question of permitting $$$$ respondent to pay the compensatory tariff as indicated in its counter we are of the opinion that it requires no permission from this court. it is upto $$$$ respondent to take a decision in accordance with law to the best of its understanding. we may make it clear that if $$$$ respondent chooses to make such payment the same shall be subject to the result of the appeal. the i.a. is disposed of as indicated above.
