$$$ j. the instant appeal arises out of a judgment and order passed by the patna high court dismissing the election petition no. of preferred by the appellant challenging the election of the respondent herein -$$$ the returned candidate to the legislative assembly. the dispute relates to the election held in fatua reserved assembly constituency s.c.in the state of bihar in the year. the appellant amongst others in the fray was a candidate for the election as a nominee of $$$ u. he belongs to $$$. the respondent $$$ was a nominee of $$$ r claiming to be belonging to $$$ community which is of the $$$ communities. it appears that some objections were raised regarding the nomination of the respondent $$$ on the ground that he does not belong to $$$ community rather he is $$$ by caste which falls in the category of other $$$. the caste certificate furnished by the respondent before the returning officer was also under cloud in respect whereof the returning officer entertained grave suspicion as a result of which she lodged as fir on the basis of which a criminal case has also been registered against the respondent. he was also arrested in connection with that case. however the returning officer accepted the nomination paper of the respondent for contesting the aforesaid election. the election was held on.and the result was ultimately declared on.declaring respondent $$$ as elected having polled votes whereas the petitir appellant had secured votes which was next to the highest polled in favour of the respondent. as indicated above the petitir filed an election petition challenging the election of the respondent amongst other on the ground that he was not entitled to contest from a reserved constituency as a scheduled $$$ candidate since he is $$$ by caste. in this light the case of the petition was that the nomination paper of the respondent was wrongly accepted by the returning officer. more particularly since the returning officer herself had initiated criminal proceedings by filing an fir relating to the certificate furnished by the respondent being a fabricated document. the definite case of the appellant is that the respondent is a resident of surangpur of jehanabad assembly constituency and he is the son of $$$ who married to $$$ and both are $$$ by $$$. evidence has been led to indicate that $$$ and his brother are also married in $$$ families. the voters list of jahanabad assembly constituency was also summd indicating the respondent as son of $$$ and $$$ is shown to be $$$ 's wife. $$$ and his brother have been shown to be sons of $$$. the case of the respondent as pleaded in the written statement is that his father $$$ a $$$ by caste had married $$$ devi at village $$$ who is $$$ by caste. the respondent and his brother are borne to the said smt.$$$ devi. the brothers remained in village $$$ with their mother at the house of their maternal uncle until they attained majority whereafter they along with their mother shifted to patna. $$$ had been visiting their mother occasionally at village $$$. according to the respondent in view of certain circulars issued by the state government in case of an inter -caste marriage where the wife is a scheduled $$$ the children borne out of the wedlock would be treated as scheduled $$$. the voters list of village $$$ also seems to have been filed indicating the respondent as son of $$$ and $$$ devi. so far the question of submission of caste certificate before the returning officer is concerned the respondent 's case is that the same was brought to him by some who happened to be a man of the petitir appellant. as such he has been implicated in the case of furnishing a false certificate. the original certificate issued by the collector $$$ has not been challenged. out of the issues framed the relevant issues with which we are concerned in the present appeal are issues no. and as quoted below:"(iii whether the nomination paper of the sole respondent has been improperly and illegally accepted as per the allegations made in the election petition?(iv what relief if any the petitir is entitled to?". the main controversy under issue no. is undoubtedly on the question as to whether the respondent $$$ is $$$ by caste or is a $$$ having allegedly borne of $$$ devi belonging to s.c. community. both parties understood the issue no. in the same manner and have led oral and documentary evidence on the point. the oral evidence led on behalf of the petitir is to the effect that $$$ the father of $$$ is $$$ by caste and his wife $$$ is also a $$$. some residents of village $$$ have also been examined by the petitir to state that there was no person by the name of $$$ in that village and they denied the fact that the respondent was borne of $$$ devi in village $$$. the respondent also examined several witnesses to support his case. ram eqbal singh has been examined as dw aged about years belonging to village $$$ saying that $$$ of village bhavanichak had some sort of affinity with $$$ devi and about years ago they married out of their marriage $$$ and $$$ were borne and after the birth of the son $$$ had severed all relationship with $$$ devi and thereafter never visited the village $$$. $$$ other witnesses some relations of $$$ devi have been examined including her brother who supported the case of the respondent. the high court while dealing with the evidence observes that the evidence which has been led by the petitir is more of a circumstantial nature. for example the fact that undisputedly father of $$$ is $$$ by caste married to $$$ who is also $$$. $$$ and his brother are also married in $$$ families. it is also noted in the judgment that the whole story of marriage of $$$ with $$$ devi a $$$ lady had not been disclosed at the time of the scrutiny of the nomination paper to explain as to on what basis $$$ claimed to be a $$$. the caste certificate was issued even though his father is a $$$ married to a $$$ lady namely $$$. at this stage it would be appropriate to quote some of the findings recorded by the high court. after observing that the petitir appellant could not produce any direct evidence about the caste of the respondent $$$ it is found:"as the election petitir is not from the family of the respondent or his relation so it can not be possible to have any special knowledge regarding the caste but he could not produce any person from the family of $$$ or $$$ himself who can prove that $$$ the respondent is a $$$ by caste through a $$$ mother i. $$$.emphasis supplied)to us the above observations seems to be unsustainable. thee would obviously be no occasion for the election petitir to examine $$$ in support of his case while challenging the election of n else but the son of $$$ himself. a person borne in a $$$ family which details have been provided would normally be taken to be $$$ by caste. but it is only in special circumstances as may have been provided under a circular of the government of bihar that the caste of the mother would be taken as the caste of the children if she happens to be a scheduled $$$ married to a non -scheduled $$$. there is no denial of the fact that $$$ is a $$$ as well as $$$ wife of $$$. the story as put forward by the respondent about his caste is something which would be in the special knowledge of the respondent and $$$ and $$$ devi. there was no occasion for the appellant to examine $$$ or any member of his family once it was given out by the appellant that $$$ and his wife $$$ both are $$$ by caste. the facts of which special knowledge is with the respondent he al had to prove those facts by adducing the best evidence on the point of his being a $$$ by caste. it may however be pertinent again to quote of the observations of the high court which is as follows:"the position of burden of proof as would be on principle of law that any fact which has been asserted by a person should be proved by him and if the same has been proved prima facie then only the burden is shifted to the adverse party to rebut the same. but such sort of shifting of burden and placing of variations remain only an academic when both parties adduce evidence in support of their contention on the vexed issues.in the light of the above observations it is only to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced by both the parties as to who has been able to prove 's case. it is true that the respondent has examined some witnesses belonging to village adi including his maternal uncle to support his case but neither $$$ nor $$$ evi both of whom are alive have been examined to prove the fact in respect of which they al would be the best witnesses to depose. in this connection the high court has also observed thus;"very peculiarly both the mother and father of $$$ are alive but n of them have been cited as witness by either of the parties. in the list of witnesses deo kumari devi and $$$ were cited as witnesses for the respondent but for the reasons best known to them they have not been produced as witnesses.it is clear that the respondent well understood the relevance and weight of the evidence of $$$ and deo kumari devi who were cited as witnesses in list of his witnesses but they have obviously been withheld and not produced before the court. respondent has not indicated any reason for their non -production. at the same time the court is led by the case of the respondent as asserted in the written statement that his father did not care of his sons after their birth and had left them. the court observes that this may be a cogent reason for not adducing the evidence of $$$ from the said of respondent. surprisingly the court looses sight of the fact that despite such an averment made in the written statement $$$ has been cited as witness of the respondent. further so far mother is concerned she is with the respondent and their is no reason of any kind of bad relations between the respondent and his mother deo kumari devi to not to produce her. the reason imagined by the court for non -production of $$$ will not apply to deo kumari devi. it is observed by the high court itself as no explanation has been given from the said of the respondent as to why their mother deo kumari devi could not be examined in the case as it has been vehemently argued from the side of the election petitir that withholding deo kumari devi from being a witness brings an adverse inference against the respondent as contemplated under section of the evidence act.it may further be worth while to refer to some of the other observations made by the high court e.g.that $$$ and his wife $$$ both are $$$s but it would not mean that respondent was borne of $$$ which fact it is observed is not anywhere mentid specifically in the election petition. it is a queer observation and the approach adopted by the high court. there was no occasion to state further in the election petition that the respondent was borne of $$$ out of her wedlock with $$$ who are husband and wife and $$$s by caste unless it is proved by the other side by any evidence that the petitir had knowledge of the alleged marriage of $$$ with a $$$ lady namely deo kumari devi in another village namely adi where $$$ never resided nor deo kumari devi was ever brought to reside with $$$ in his village. however on the basis of untenable observation as indicated above the high court found:"so the prima facie fact regarding the case of the respondent could not be proved from the side of the election petitir. but definitely a doubt could be created regarding the caste of the respondent as already stated above. strangely enough we again find yet another fragile and strange observation as follows:"the election petitir himself in his evidence had not denied categorically that the respondent had not been born to the womb of deo kumari devi. only vague statement has been made that both father and mother of $$$ were $$$ by the caste. the conclusion drawn by the high court that respondent was a competent person to contest from reserved constituency is accompanied with the following observation:"definitely if a person is born of a $$$ father or in a $$$ family then the presumption goes that the child is $$$ by caste. but here the respondent could make out a special case that although he has been born of a $$$ father but mother being a $$$ he is a scheduled $$$ and as such a competent person to contest from the reserved constituency.it is again in that context observed:"it is true that the controversy can be well thrashed out if $$$ and deo kumari devi have been examined by either of the parties.we have already observed that there was no occasion for the petitir appellant to examine either of them. but there is no such cogent reason for the respondent not to examine them. it is again observed:"then question comes of deo kumari devi. she had not bee produced by the respondent and she is in custody of the respondent himself as per his statement during the course of evidence. no reasons have been stated as to why she has not been produced. this may cast some adverse inference against the respondent. but such adverse inference along is not sufficient enough to hold that the respondent is not a pasi by caste.it is then observed that the petitir is not proved his case to the hilt though a suspicion or doubt has been cast. we may consider a few cases on the point of drawing adverse inference in the event of withholding of a witness. in $$$ / sc/08/99$$$ / sc/08/99 $$$ ketkar v. mahomed haji latif and ors.it has been held that a party who is in possession of best evidence which would throw light on the issue in controversy withholds such evidence an adverse inference under section of the evidence act ought to be drawn against such a party notwithstanding that the onus of proof may not lie on him. it is observed that a party can not rely on abstract doctrine of onus of proof or on the fact that he was not called upon to produce such evidence. in the instant case however the onus of proof that the respondent was $$$ by $$$ due to alleged marriage of $$$ with deo kumari devi in some other place was wholly within the special knowledge of the respondent. in $$$ / sc/070/97$$$ / sc/070/97 $$$ saklecha v. $$$ and ors.the allegation of threatening voters with divine displeasure in speech delivered in some meetings was not accepted and an adverse inference was drawn due to non -production of material witness and the notes made by him at the meeting. in yet another case in reported $$$ / $$$ / sc/08/9 lachman utamchand $$$ v. meena alias mota a matrimonial dispute in which the question as to whether or not the wife had left the husband 's place with the consent of husband 's parents non -production of parents of the husband led to adverse inference drawn against the husband. in the case of in hand the respondent was supposed to prove the facts within his special knowledge by adducing best evidence namely $$$ and deo kumari devi which he failed to do. in these circumstances the high court erred in observing that the appellant should have examined $$$. the case of the parties is clear from their pleadings and the evidence adduced by them as indicated above. the petitir challenged the status of respondent $$$ as a $$$ person belonging to the s.c. community. precisely what was indicated in support of that case is that father of $$$ and $$$ is $$$ who is $$$ by caste married to $$$ also a $$$ lady. the high court has also observed that a person borne in a $$$ family normally would be presumed that he is $$$ by caste. in this background the initial burden of the petitir would stand discharged and it would shift upon the respondent to prove his case which in normal course of things would be and is within his special knowledge. a case which has been set up by the respondent through his witnesses as well that his father had taken a fancy for deo kumari devi a resident of village $$$ who is $$$ by caste and married her who gave birth to children including the respondent would normally be not in the knowledge of people in general particularly when according to the case of the respondent himself $$$ lived in another village and she was never brought from there by $$$. more so when $$$ a $$$ by caste is living with his wife $$$ also a $$$ in their village jahanabad. the best evidence as also according to the high court to prove the case of the respondent was to produce $$$ and deo kumari devi but they have been withheld after being cited as witnesses for the respondent. these facts clearly make out a case for drawing an adverse inference that in case they had been produced they would not have supported the case of the respondent. $$$ / sc/0/9$$$ / sc/0/9 air sc $$$ v. custodian evacuee property bombay $$$ / pr/00/9$$$ / pr/00/9 air pc t.s. $$$ v. m.d. gnana sambandha pandara sannadhi and $$$ / sc/0/977$$$ / sc/0/977. and thiru $$$ and anr. v. the returning officer and ors. may also be referred on the point. on behalf of the respondent the citation of certain decisions has also been furnished but those decisions would be of no help to the respondent. reliance has been placed upon $$$ / sc/0698/999$$$ / sc/0698/999 air000sc6 jeet mohinder singh v. harminder singh jassi where it has been held that a party upon whom the burden lies to prove a fact but fails to discharge his onus it is not open for him to bank upon the plea of non -examination of witness by the other party. the appellant it was held can not be permitted to derive strength from the weakness of the case of the other party. we feel that this case would not be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand. on the other hand the onus to prove facts within the special knowledge of respondent no. would lie upon him al to prove those facts. we have already held that best evidence of the respondent 's case that his mother was a $$$ has been withheld. in this connection we may peruse section of the evidence act also which reads as under:-"when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person the burden of proving to that effect is upon him.apart from the above the appellant had also discharged his burden by proving the fact that the father of respondent no. is $$$ a $$$ by caste married to jago devi also a $$$ by caste. the natural inference in such circumstances would be that the respondent would in normal course of events be a $$$ by caste. if there is anything contrary to the normal course of events as pleaded in this case of another marriage of $$$ in some other village namely $$$ with deo kumari devi who never came to live with $$$ in his village nor $$$ ever lived there. such facts in the special knowledge of the respondent have to be proved by him al. the respondent was under duty to prove his case both ways namely in view of the special knowledge of facts pleaded and again in view of the fact that the appellant had discharged his initial burden of showing that the respondent was $$$ by caste being son of $$$ $$$ married to jago devi also $$$. the other decision which has been referred to on behalf of the respondent is $$$ / sc/08/99$$$ / sc/08/99 $$$ paricha v. $$$ and ors. it is in connection with the fact that the evidence of the brother of $$$ that $$$ had married her was relevant for the purposes of relationship of person to another since brother of deo kumari devi is a person who is a member of the family or otherwise has special means of knowledge of the particular relationship. the decision is in reference to section of the evidence act. it may be observed that the evidence of persons who belong to village $$$ including the brother of deo kumari devi have been examined by the respondent to establish the allegation of marriage between $$$ and deo kumari devi. undoubtedly the evidence of brother of deo kumari devi would be relevant for the relationship between $$$ and deo kumari devi but his evidence would not be of any help in view of the adverse inference drawn under section of the evidence act due to withholding of the best evidence available on the point. when the persons concerned are not coming forward to the court to depose about the alleged relationship and an adverse inference has been drawn that if they had come to the court to depose their evidence would have g against the respondent in such circumstances there is no occasion to act upon the statement of dw the brother of deo kumari devi or other witnesses. reliance has also been placed on decisions $$$ / sc/070/969$$$ / sc/070/969 samant n. $$$ etc. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0688/00$$$ / sc/0688/00 and $$$ v. $$$ on the proposition that full particulars and all the material facts must be pleaded in the election petition. it is not understandable as to how these cases would help the respondent. the petitir has pleaded that respondent is son of $$$ who is $$$ by caste and wife of $$$ is jago devi also a lady $$$ by caste. it is also stated that the respondent and his brother are married with $$$ ladies. these are the material facts relating to the plea raised by the appellant that the respondent is not a $$$. we do n't think if the respondent means to say that the petitir should have stated in the petition that the respondent is not born of deo kumari devi said to be married to $$$ in village adai. if at all these facts would be in the special knowledge of respondent $$$ and deo kumari devi hence not required to be pleaded in the election petition. it is not possible as well. in this connection a reference may be made to a decision of this court $$$ / sc/09/960$$$ / sc/09/960 balwan singh v. $$$ and ors. this case also relates to election matter and it was held that facts which are in the special knowledge of the other party could not be pleaded by the election petitir. it was found that particulars of the arrangement of hiring or procuring a vehicle would never be in the knowledge of the petitir such facts need not and can not be pleaded in the petition. the learned counsel for the respondent then submits that in fact the issue framed by the high court was not to the effect as to whether the respondent is a $$$ or $$$ by caste. rather it is to the effect whether the nomination paper of $$$ had been improperly and illegally accepted as per allegations made in the election petition or not. in this connection it may be observed in the background of the allegations made in the election petition the core issue was as to whether $$$ belongs to a $$$ community or not. both parties led evidence on the question. hence both sides understood the case in the same way and no party was misled due to framing of the issue no. as it has been framed. we may however consider the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent from the angle as sought to be canvassed as well namely the nomination paper of respondent was improperly and illegally accepted by the returning officer or not on the basis of the evidence on the record. in that connection we may refer to the statement of pw smt. safina returning officer who was posted as sub -divisional magistrate patna city. she has stated that as returning officer she had scrutinized the nomination paper of the respondent filed for fatua assembly constituency. she had received some complaints about his nomination paper. she has stated that prima facie on looking into the case a doubt was created in her mind regarding its veracity. she had received such information beforehand through the district magistrate. she had also got the matter inquired through the district welfare officer $$$. the district magistrate had also considered the report of the district welfare officer to be correct. in the above circumstances she had lodged a report against the respondent $$$ with the police. she had however postpd the matter of scrutiny of nomination paper from.to.. $$$$ she accepted the nomination paper of the respondent $$$. she has admitted that before she had lodged the fir she was in receipt of the report of the district welfare officer $$$. she also states that lodging of the fir definitely goes against the candidature of $$$. in cross -examination she states that according to the relevant provisions she did not find it necessary that a caste certificate must be filed along with the nomination paper. she also states that on the date of scrutiny objectors could not produce any document or proof to the effect that $$$ did not belong to $$$. $$$ several objections filed against the nomination of $$$ it is given out there that $$$ belongs to $$$ community and his father and mother both are $$$s. the fact which is quite clear is that the returning officer had grave doubt about the veracity of the caste certificate to the extent that she lodged an fir against the candidate namely $$$. in support of the suspicion entertained about the caste certificate being fabricated she had a report from the district welfare officer $$$. a criminal case was registered and the respondent was also arrested. it is only surprising that despite such a grave suspicion and initiation of criminal proceedings against the candidate the returning officer still accepted his nomination paper. she has stated that on.after she had lodged the report there was lot of opposition in respect of the nomination paper of the respondent. she has admitted that the respondent was a nominee of the ruling party in the state. she postpd the matter for $$$$ when she accepted the nomination paper of the respondent. going by normal conduct no prudent person would accept such a nomination paper in respect of which there is an information that caste certificate entitling to be a candidate from a reserved constituency in suspected to be forged and fabricated supported by a report subsequently by n else but a responsible officer namely the district welfare officer $$$. after taking a decision to criminally prosecute a person of the charge of filing fabricated caste certificate it goes against the normal human conduct of a prudent person who still accept such a nomination paper. the nomination if rejected the respondent could further agitate the matter by filing an election petition. this question would not depend upon the fact as to ultimately case of which of the party would be found to be correct or false. the question is after having entertaining such a grave doubt so as to decide to criminally prosecute a person still to accept the nomination paper runs contrary to normal conduct of a prudent and responsible officer. on the above basis it can well be said without any hesitation that nomination paper of return candidate respondent was improperly accepted by the returning officer. it ought to have been rejected by the returning officer in the background of the above facts and circumstances. thus examining the matter from any angle we do not find the judgment of the high court sustainable. in the result the appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment and order passed by the high court is set aside as well as the election of the respondent to fatua assembly constituency of state of bihar. the election commission of india is called upon to hold election for filling up the vacancy caused by the setting aside of the election of the respondent. as per requirement of section of the representation of people act the substance of the decision shall be intimated to the election commission and the speaker of the legislative assembly of the state of bihar. an authenticated copy shall also be sent to the election commission at the earliest.s.b. sinha j. $$$ relating to castes races and tribes of a person is governed by $$$ and of the constitution of india. article reads scheduled castes.the president may with respect to any state or union territory and where it is a state after consultation with the governor thereof by public notification specify the castes races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes races or tribes which shall for the purposes of this constitution be deemed to be scheduled $$$s in relation to that state or union territory as the case may be.parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of scheduled $$$s specified in a notification issued under $$$ any caste race or tribe or part of or group within any caste race or tribe but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification. the object of clause of article is to provide preferential right by way of protection to the members of the scheduled $$$ having regard to the economic and educational backwardness from which they suffer. it is in relation thereto the president has been authorised to limit the notification to parts or groups within the castes. the notification issued in terms of the said provision is exhaustive. how the caste or tribe of the person is to be determined depends upon several factors including the customary laws. the president of india in exercise of his power conferred under article of the constitution of india notified constitution scheduled $$$s order. the tribes $$$ admittedly finds place in the said notification whereas $$$ does not. by reason of articles of the constitution a legal fiction is created which is to be given its full effect. $$$ has been defined in collins english dictionary as any of the major hereditary classes namely the brahman kshatriya vaisya and sudra into which hindu society is divided. the caste system in india is engrained in indian mind. a person in the absence of any statutory law would inherit his caste from his father and not his mother even in a case of inter -caste marriage. in the caste system in india -myth and reality by dr. $$$ the different attributes of the caste as unit mentid by various writers has been stated thus:". basic pivotal)attributes endogamy. sufficiently relevant attributes:(i membership by birth(ii common occupation(iii $$$ council. peripheral attributes:(i name(ii diacritical sign.following the same pattern of attribute -hierarchy the attributes that characterize caste as system have been drawn up and set in as follows:. basic attribute plurality of interacting endogamous groups. sufficiently relevant attribute hierarchy. peripheral attribute traditional division of labour.besides these ghurye among others has also mentid segmental division of society hierarchy restriction on feeding and social intercourse and civil and religious disabilities and privileges of the different sections as characteristics of the caste. above them all nagendra has made mention of the principle of individual freedom as of the attributes of the caste which seems to have been omitted by most of the authors.in summary then hierarchy restricted commensality and connubium hereditary occupation and a clear -cut differentiation of functions ritual observance and the principle of individual freedom are characteristics of the caste system till $$$$. in $$$ in modern india and other essays by m.n. srinivas at page it is stated:"a sociologist would define caste as a hereditary endogamous usually localized group having a traditional association with an occupation and a particular position in the local hierarchy of castes. relations between castes are governed among other things by the concepts of pollution and purity and generally maximum commensality occurs within the caste. in $$$ and the $$$ in india by justice s.b. $$$ at page under the heading sociological implications ' it is stated:"traditionally a person belongs to a caste in which he is born. the caste of the parents determines his caste but in case of re -conversion a person has the liberty to renounce his casteless status and voluntarily accept his original caste. his caste status at birth is not immutable. change of religion does not necessarily mean loss of caste. if the original caste does not positively disapprove the acceptance of the caste can be presumed. such acceptance can also be presumed if he is elected by a majority to a reserved seat. although it appears that some dent is made on the classical concept of caste it may be noticed that the principle that caste is created by birth is not dethrd. there is also a judicial recognition of caste autonomy including right to outcaste a person. if he is considered to be a member of $$$ he has to be accepted by the community. see c.m. arumugam v. v.s. rejagopal and ors. $$$ / sc/08/97$$$ / sc/08/97 and $$$ guntur medical college v. v.y. mohan rao -$$$ / $$$ / sc/007/976. a christian by birth when converted to hinduism and married a member of $$$ was held to be belonging to her husband 's caste on the evidence that she had not only been accepted but also welcomed by the important members including the president and vice -president of the community. see kailash sonkar v. smt. $$$ / sc/006/98$$$ / sc/006/98. in the instant caste there is nothing on record to show that the respondent has even been treated to be a member of $$$. in fact evidence suggests that he has not been so treated. he as well as his brothers and other members of his family are married to persons belonging to his own caste i. kurmi. there was no attempt on the part of the respondent herein to bring on records any material to the effect that he was treated as a member of $$$ ' community. furthermore no evidence has been brought on record to show that the family of the respondent had adopted and had been practising the customary traits and tenets of $$$ ' community. the question as to whether a person belongs to a particular caste or not has to be determined by the statutory specified therefore. in b. basavalingappa v. d. munichinnappa $$$ / sc/08/96$$$ / sc/08/96 a constitution bench of this court considered the scope of article and which is in pari materia with article and and held that it is not open to any person to lead evidence to establish that the caste to which he belongs to is the same as and/or part of another caste which is included in the constitution $$$s order it was observed:"it may be accepted that it is not open to make any modification in the order by producing evidence to show for example that though caste a along is mentid in the order caste b is also a part of caste a and therefore must be deemed to be included in caste a. it may also be accepted that wherever caste has another name it has been mentid in brackets after it in the order see $$$ $$$ $$$ etc. therefore generally speaking it would not be open to any person to lead evidence to establish that caste b in the example quoted above is part of caste a notified in the order. see also $$$ v. shivchand $$$ / sc/07/968$$$ / sc/07/968. in kumari $$$$ patil v. addl commissir tribal development and ors. $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99 air99sc9 this court denounced the practice of persons claiming benefits conferred on sts by producing fake false and fraudulent certificates observing:"the admission wrongly gained or appointment wrongly obtained on the basis of false social status certificate necessarily has the effect of depriving the genuine $$$s or scheduled tribes or obc candidates as enjoined in the construction of the benefits conferred on them by the constitution. the genuine candidates are also denied admission to educational institutions or appointments to office or posts under a state for want of social status certificate. the ineligible or spurious persons who falsely gained entry resort to dilatory tactics and create hurdles in completion of the inquiries by the scrutiny committee. it is true that the applications for admission to educational institutions are generally made by a parent since on that date many a time the student may be a minor. it is the parent or the guardian who may play fraud claiming false status certificate. similar observations have also been made in director of tribal welfare v. laveti giri manu / sc/088/99manu / sc/088/99. a person in fact not belonging to $$$ if claims himself to be a member thereof by procuring a bogus caste certificate would be committing fraud on constitution. no court of law can encourage commission of such fraud. this court in kumari madhuri patil and anr. v. addl. commissir tribal development thane and ors. second manu / sc/0670/997manu / sc/0670/997 laid down the law thus:". as regards prayer read with direction no. of the order of this court we too appreciate the inconvenience caused due to vast area of the state. therefore instead of committee of officers there will be scheduled tribe / $$$ comprising of members with quorum of members as suggested in para of the directions to take a decision. at pune nasik and nagpur $$$ for scs $$$ nomadic tribes other $$$ and the special backward category in existence at mumbai pune nasik aurangabad amravati and nagpur would continue to scrutinise the certificates issued by the respective officers and take a decision in that behalf. in this regard it is also suggested by $$$ learned senior counsel for the applicant that in case any certificate has been wrongfully refused by the certificate issuing authority the aforestated committees also would go into the question and decide in that behalf whether refusal was wrongful and in case it finds that the refusal was wrongful they are at liberty to direct the authority to grant the certificate. with regard to prayer d along with the vigilance cell research officer / tribal development or social welfare officer would be associated in finding the social status of eligibility of the officers. determination of caste of a person is governed by the customary laws. a person under the customary hindu law would inheriting his caste from his father. in this case it is not denied or disputed that the respondent 's father belonged to a kurmi ' caste. he was therefore not a member of scheduled caste. the caste of the father therefore will be the determinative factor in absence of any law. reliance however has been placed upon a circular dated.said to have been issued by the state of bihar which is in the following determination of caste of a child born from non -schedule $$$ hindu father and schedule $$$ mother.sir in the aforesaid subject as per instruction i have to state for the determination of a child born from non -schedule $$$ father and schedule caste mother upon deliberation it has been decided that child born from such parents will be counted in the category of schedule caste. in such cases before the issue of caste certificate there will be a illegible enquiry by the block development officer / circle officer / block welfare officer. the said circular letter has not been issued by the state in exercise of its power under article of the constitution of india. it is not stated therein that the decision has been taken by the cabinet or any authority authorized in this behalf in terms of article of the constitution of india. it is trite that a circular letter being an administrative instruction is not a law within the meaning of article of the constitution of india. see dwarka nath tewari and ors. v. state of bihar and ors. air sc. a person can take the benefit of a reserved category candidate if he satisfies the test laid down by the constitution of india the representation of the people act and the guidelines issued by the election commission if any. in our opinion the state has no jurisdiction to reserve a constituency for a person who does not belong to the reserved category for whose benefit it was constituted except by way of a legislation. if a customary law is to be given a go -bye for any purpose whatsoever and particularly for the purpose of enlarging the scope of a notification issued by the president of india under clause of article of constitution of india the same must be done in terms of a statute and not otherwise. the high court itself noticed that the caste certificate of the respondent was found to be forged by the returning officer and a criminal case is pending. it was held:"definitely if a person is born of a kurmi father or in a kurmi family then the presumption goes that the child is kurmi by caste. but here the respondent could make out a special case that although he has been born of a kurmi father but mother being a $$$ he is a scheduled $$$ and as such a competent person to contest from the reserved constituency. the high court therefore erred in so far as it failed to consider that for the purpose of determination of caste the respondent could not have relied upon the circular letter dated.in absence of any law. in any event it has not been shown by the respondent as to what enquiry was made for determination of his caste. if he had taken part in some enquiry he had special knowledge in respect thereof within the meaning of section of the evidence act. he therefore was bound to prove the same by bringing on records relevant evidence which was in his power or possession. if a special case is to be made out the same has to be done in accordance with law. it must meet the legal requirement. unfortunately this aspect of the matter has not been considered by the high court. the impugned judgment therefore can not be sustained. subject to aforementioned i respectfully agree with the opinion of my learned brother.
