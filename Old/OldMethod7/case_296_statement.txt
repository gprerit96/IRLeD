against him. however his wife filed $$$. petition no. of on.for continuing the said appeal. by order dated.we granted such permission and appeal is heard on merits. the prosecution version is that a- $$$ $$$ was an employee dy. manager of mul a government company as provided under section of the companies act a- ambuj $$$ was also an employee senior $$$ecutive of mul who joined mul on.a- $$$ deosthali was an employee assistant manager of uco bank at hamam street $$$anch mumbai a- ram narayan$$$ was an employee officer attached to the remittance / clearance section of anz $$$ bank delhi $$$anch and a- harshad $$$ was a financial broker operating in my market and securities. in short it is prosecution version that a- to a- entered into a criminal conspiracy to siphon off the funds of mul in favour of a- for which afore -quoted transactions took place even though there was prohibition on granting loan by mul to individuals. it is stated that a- and a- were working closely and they had dominion over the property of mul. a- used to place the proposal before the board and obtain approval for the investments. a- and a- used to give instructions on the basis of which letters addressed to banks were prepared. it is alleged that they misappropriated the property in violation of the law as well as their duty express and implied by making it available for use of a-. this is on account of the fact that they were authorised to invest the my in the defined securities in a transaction with $$$s only. they however knowingly entered into a series of transactions which had the result of making the funds of mul available to a-. it is also the prosecution version that they a a and a being public servants during the material time abused their position and thereby conferred a pecuniary advantage upon a- and in any event while holding office as a public servant obtained a pecuniary advantage for a- against public interest. thus they were charged with an offence under section of the pc act. it is further stated by the prosecution that a- alongwith a- a- and a- conspired to obtain funds from mul under the pretence that the funds were being drawn for purchasing securities from uco bank but diverted these funds to the accounts of a- for which a- and a- played the role of misrepresenting to mul and withdrawing the funds. a- forged documents which helped a- to secure the release of monies from mul. a- conspired alongwith a- and a- for making my available to a- who became the prime beneficiary of the my. the banker 's cheques were handed over on the instructions of a- and a- to $$$ an employee of a-.submissions-. $$$ senior counsel mr. $$$ appearing for a- at the outset submitted that from the aforesaid transactions it is apparent that the investment / loan was for a short period. yield interest is at a higher rate. according to him the amount is received and paid on due dates. there is no loss to mul or to the uco bank and the bank has received commission for the said commercial transactions.  transaction is loan taken by the mul through uco bank from a- on the basis of lacs of uti units by given by mul to a through uco bank. it is his submission that in view of these facts it is apparent that prosecution is motivated and the conviction of the accused requires to be set aside. for the prosecution it is the contention of the learned solicitor general mr. harish n. $$$ that the aforesaid transactions were subterfuge or a facade for a loan transaction which can not be entered into by mul in favour of a-. it is his contention that in the background of the resolutions passed by the board of directors of mul and on the basis of the guidelines issued by the $$$. mul could not give loan to a- and therefore there was a conspiracy between a- and a- for diverting the funds of mul by having subterfuge of sale or purchase of units of uti by the uco bank to mul. in furtherance of the said conspiracy for $$$$ to transactions a- got issued cheques by the $$$ bank in favour of $$$ bank which in turn transferred the said amount in account of a- at delhi and thereafter at bombay. anz $$$ bank 's bombay $$$anch issued cheque to uco bank at hamam street and from there the amount was paid to a-. for this subterfuge mul delivered cheques to a- through its representatives. if the transaction was between mul and uco bank the cheque would have been delivered to the representative of uco bank either at delhi or at bombay. if there was a loan transaction between the mul and a- then there was no necessity of issuing cheque in favour of $$$ bank at new delhi and transferring the said amount to uco bank. it is the prosecution version that as the transactions were not genuine and as loan could not be given to a- in his individual capacity it was given to a- by creating forged documents. he pointed out that after receiving the cheques issued by $$$ bank on behalf of mul in favour of $$$ bank the same were immediately encashed on $$$$ and thereafter $$$ bank new delhi again transferred the same to its bombay branch in favour of a-. $$$ a- gave cheques to uco bank. this itself indicates that as the transactions were not genuine irregular and illegal procedure was adopted for encashing the cheques. therefore this is a case of misappropriation and forgery. further if there was genuine sale of units by uco bank to mul the transactions would have been straight forward between uco bank and mul. it is the prosecution version that brokering by bank is not allowed and therefore to contend that commission was paid to uco bank is not a just ground for holding that there was no misappropriation or forgery. if there was a genuine transaction then the cheques would not have been issued in favour of $$$ bank for so -called expeditious movement of funds. if a person acts in a manner which is sinister or contrary to law then it can not be said that the transaction was as per the commercial practice. it is a case of forgery because certain sets of documents are created where there is no real or genuine transaction. it is also contended that a- was not having any authority to purchase or sell units or behalf of the bank. ly he got letters $$$s. and typed outside the office and nobody knows wherefrom the said letters were got typed and this would not be in normal course of business. this would be a most relevant factor for judging whether his act was dishonour or not. a- wrote a document which he had no authority to write with a specific motive to enable the transaction to be completed and my pulled out of mul and he issued bank receipts hereinafter referred to as $$$s without having security namely having uti units. the learned counsel admits that there is no direct evidence on record to establish that $$$s were issued without possessing the units but inference can be drawn that the same were issued without holding units as a- has not maintained any record for this purpose. contra mr. $$$ learned senior counsel submitted that despite the voluminous record consisting of massive volumes the case remains a simple. admittedly transactions took place between mul and a- during the period from end of $$$$ to beginning of $$$$. as per the transaction a- lent my to mul. loan period was for $$$$ $$$$ and the interest rate was.%. mul returned the loan amount on due date with agreed interest. this was secured loan as mul transferred and delivered lac units of uti to a-. though formally it was an out and out sale by mul to a- it was understood that this was only to secure repayment of the loan on the due date. it is the case of a- that except for transaction he borrowed my from the mul because mul had surplus funds which mul were to invest and make substantial profits out of investment. a- returned the borrowed amount on due date with interest in each transaction. all the said transactions were backed by $$$s as collateral security and the $$$s were backed by requisite number of units. loan was for a short period e.g. $$$$ transaction was for $$$$ was for $$$$ was for $$$$ and for $$$$. interest rate was also high i..% %.% and % respectively. it is his submission that it is absurd to suggest that a- committed any offence or offences but the prosecution is a piece of political revenge against a- for disclosing certain facts to the press against the political leaders. he contends that transactions were loan transactions because in all these transactions the rate of interest and number of $$$$ for which the loan was being advanced was settled before the my and the units changed hands. this is consistent only with the transaction being a loan transaction. he also submitted that mainly the prosecution case in the fir dated.which was lodged after preliminary enquiry which started from.as well as in the charge -sheet submitted by the $$$ on.was that mul gave loan to a- at a lower rate of interest and suffered loss. the learned senior counsel submitted that fir was lodged after investigation for months and charge -sheet was submitted after more than year and months which itself indicates that $$$ knew that there was no case to be put up before a court and the investigation was kept alive for sordid and dishst motive. he pointed out that--( the $$$ itself understood that the fir was based upon the single allegation that mul should have received more interest than it actually received. the charge -sheet nowhere states that at the time of the fir the nature of these transactions was misunderstood or that they changed their mind after investigation paragraph of the charge -sheet expressly confirms that the transaction was loan transaction inasmuch as it is averred that mul borrowed the amount at a higher rate of interest at.% per annum for $$$$s against physical delivery of lacs units of the uti paragraph of the charge -sheet refers to the transaction of th march which describes it as an investment of crores and odd from mul for $$$$ $$$$s at the interest rate of.% per annum. this is nothing but a loan to $$$. $$$ paragraphs and contain similar descriptions of the remaining transactions. he further submitted that cheques were drawn in favour of $$$ bank for expeditious transmission of amounts of a- the loan transactions were only for $$$$ and $$$$ are lost in realising the amounts through normal banking practice the accused was to lose lacs of rupees. for this he relied on evidence of prosecution witnesses that such facilities were available only in foreign banks. he contended that there is no evidence on record that $$$ bank or the $$$ bank had any objection to this course of dealing. he further contends that there is no question of conspiracy to siphon off the surplus funds of mul as the amount was lent on security and repaid with interest on due dates. he contends that prosecution has tried to prove the theory of so -called absurd conspiracy by the sole evidence of approver pw and has failed to prove the same miserably. he pointed out that before taking loan units of uti were deposited or were with the uco bank and there is no evidence on record to establish that units were not with the uco bank at the time when the $$$s were issued. it is his submission that in a criminal prosecution it is absurd to suggest that defence has to prove that $$$s were obtained without sufficient security. the prosecution witnesses of the uco bank have admitted that necessary record was not maintained by the bank because of heavy pressure of work. it is also submitted that for similar transactions rc. was lodged and a report was submitted before the court stating that there was no case against the accused. after investigation it was discovered that the $$$s were indeed backed up by the securities hence the $$$ filed closure report dated.$$$.a- -before the high court and the said report was accepted on.. that order was upheld by this court. however the $$$ proceeded with this prosecution for an oblique motive. in written submissions filed on behalf of a- it has been further stated that the charge against a- reads as under:--"that you accused no. in furtherance of the aforesaid conspiracy did dishstly misappropriate banker 's cheque to wit. cheque no. dated.cheque no. dated.cheque no. dated.and cheque no. dated.aggregating to rs. drawn by mul on its bank to wit the $$$ bank connaught place $$$anch in favour of the anz $$$ bank and you thereby committed on offence under section of the ipc. it is contended that the point of determination is whether this charge is legally sustainable. in other words whether borrowing my on occasions and returning it on the due date with interest is an offence under section of the ipc the answer to this point is a resounding no. the learned senior counsel further submitted that following are the ingredients of the offence charged above that the accused appropriated the cheques to that the appropriation was a misappropriation;iii that it was dishst. he submits that the ingredient is satisfied a- appropriated the cheques or their proceeds to himself. a person misappropriates only when he appropriates property to himself which in fact belongs to somebody else and he does so without that persons ' consent. $$$ bank had not negotiated the loan for itself. cheques were being issued for the purpose of lending my by mul to a. the cheques and their proceeds were meant for the accused and it was the accused who was receiving it by a pay order in the name of $$$ bank. it is not the prosecution case that the amount was in fact meant for $$$ bank but it is the prosecution case that the amount was meant only for a-. it is argued that when in the transaction the loan was advanced by mul to a- it was d every time by a pay order. under that pay order issued by the $$$ bank it was to pay a sum of my to $$$ bank. $$$ bank acknowledged the receipt. this pay order had been given by the $$$ bank to an employee of a-. the very fact that this was so handed over shows that $$$ bank must have received instructions from their own customer that the cheque be handed over not to an employee of $$$ bank but to some other person. further it is submitted that the contention of the prosecution that the $$$ bank should have credited the amount to itself and then after some interval paid to its customer a- is without any substance as what has been d was only to expedite the payment so that the large amount of interest which was to be paid by a- may not go waste. what the $$$ bank did was to provide a laudable legitimate banking service. in any event every trifling departure from practice does not make the transaction illegal. at worst it is unusual but not irregular. for this it is submitted that pw $$$ asst. manager $$$ bank has fully supported the existence and propriety of this practice. the kind of pay order like $$$.has never been held to be a cheque. to hold it to be a cheque would lead to some absurdity. section of the negotiable instruments act lays down that when a cheque is crossed the banker on whom it is drawn shall not pay it otherwise than to banker. it is obvious that if the payee is itself a banker he can not be expected to present it to another banker for collection. $$$ bank can not open an account with some other bank and cash its pay orders in that account. even paying a crossed cheque otherwise than through a bank only renders the bank liable for negligence if somebody suffers a loss. if the banker is certain who the beneficiary of the cheque is it may well pay out in the certain belief that no loss will occur. it is a manifestly untenable proposition that a criminal breach of trust or misappropriation thereby takes place. even if it is assumed that the cheque was property of $$$ bank the bank can not be said to have committed any offence by passing on its property to anybody it likes. by allowing the proceeds to be credited to the account of its true customer the bank is neither guilty of negligence nor of any criminality. similarly no officer of the bank could be held liable for the same and there is no question of any liability for a-. there is no evidence that $$$ bank or the $$$ bank had any objection to this course of dealings. certainly there was no intention to cause wrongful loss to anybody because no loss has been caused an no unlawful means were used. $$$ senior counsel referred to the decision in dr. $$$ v. delhi administration $$$ / sc//$$$ / sc// and submitted that unlike the above case every thing in the present case is above board there is no deceit there is no falsehood and suppression of truth. it is contended that an approver 's evidence can not be accepted without corroboration and certainly not when it is in conflict with the unchallenged testimony of another prosecution witness. there was no justification for the court to come to the conclusion that it is accused no. who is responsible for these pay orders being credited directly in his account. of course it is without prejudice to the arguments that the amount is not directly put into his account. it is contended that even though it was necessary to recall pw for the cross -examination on the new falsehoods which were introduced through the examination -in -chief and cross -examination of pw but the learned judge dismissed the application filed on behalf of a- and it has caused incalculable damage. the illegality is of such vital importance that it vitiates the entire trial and judgment. the charge of conspiracy against a- is legally and factually absurd false and frivolous. the alleged conspiracy is supposed to have originated in $$$$ / $$$$. the sole prosecution witness who deposed about the alleged meeting of $$$$ / $$$$ is approver pw. the evidence discloses that pw had stated a willful falsehood in deposing about the said meeting. his own sworn testimony unambiguously establishes that the meeting alleged by him to have taken place could not and did not take place. according to him the alleged meeting took place either in $$$$ or $$$$ at the office premises of mul k.g. $$$ new delhi. he is categorical that a- visited new delhi once in $$$$ or $$$$. in his cross examination on behalf of a and a- he states that i can not say about the frequency of visits of a- but i recollect he having visited delhi once sometime in $$$$ $$$$. pw makes passing reference to a- 's presence at the alleged meeting so that it could be said that it was a condonable lapse of memory on his part. on appreciation of his evidence it can not be said that he had an understandably vague memory regarding a- 's presence on the contrary his deposition evidences vivid details about the role and participation of a- at the said meeting. since a- could not even be present at the meeting as he was not employed with mul on that date it is abundantly clear that pw has deposed falsely about the meeting. if a- could not have been present at the meeting pw 's insistence that a- was so present leads to the irresistible inference that his deposition regarding the alleged meeting is totally concocted. it has come on record that pw disclosed regarding the alleged meeting only on.. indeed the very suggestion by pw that a police officer who interrogated him would not question him about the circumstances of transactions is absurd and incredible. the said meeting being a crucial aspect of the instant prosecution ought to have been referred to in the very statement of pw. the fact that it was not so referred to conclusively established that the meeting never took place and reference to it in pw 's later statement of.and in his judicial confession recorded under section crpc was at the instance of the $$$ to whose suggestions he readily acceded in view of an agreement to make him an approver. it is further contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that in fact no such meeting ever took place and consequently the conspiracy charge insofar as it is alleged to have commenced from $$$$ / $$$$ is unsubstantiated by any evidence and in fact falsified by it as -the veracity of pw has been destroyed in cross examination. he denied his taped conversation and feigned ignorance of police statement. he suppressed truth from the jpc.para at page of the impugned judgment contains a legal error. the learned judge treats as corroborative evidence what in law and common sense is not corroborative evidence at all. $$$ judge has held that evidence of $$$ is corroborated from what followed thereafter in the form of various transactions between mul and a-. it is contended that the conspiracy of can not be corroborated by transaction in.in charge no. of the objects of the conspiracy is alleged to be dishst misappropriation. this has obviously reference to the charge against a-. on the facts this charge can not be established. for the same reason the charge under section ipc against a- can not stand. the other section mentid is. the learned judge has recorded no conviction under this charge and all the accused against whom this charge was framed are deemed to be acquitted of this charge. the charge of conspiracy is cooked up to cover transactions which were prior to $$$ $$$$. further the $$$ 's $$$ dated.$$$. recognizes that there was a practice followed even by the scheduled banks. when banks follow a particular practice they do so at least in the bonafide belief that the practice did not violate any law. if a practice is illegal it may not convert that which is illegal into legal but it certainly provides for bonafides and absence of dishsty. from this circular it is clear that the scheduled banks were being advised against a practice which might put them in difficulty. they were running the risk of being responsible for unauthorized payments.motivation behind the instant case:. there are several salient features of the instant prosecution which clearly show that the entire investigation has been dishst. it is almost trite to suggest that the scam act was promulgated with a view to recover public monies lost by certain banks and financial institutions in securities where such losses as a result of such transactions. it is equally trite to state the contrary proposition that where there were no losses at all the institution of the special court was wholly unnecessary and the special court was not to try such transactions even if they amounted to some technical offences. if the aforesaid propositions are correct then there is simply no justification for the instant prosecution. the joint parliamentary committee jpc succinctly set out the dimensions of the scam in its report. the committee highlighted various irregularities and fraudulent transactions undertaken by the $$$ and financial institutions etc. in the sic reports submitted by it. yet inspite of all the above mentid features peculiar to the instant case the charge sheet in the present case was of the earliest to be filed against a-. in view of the palpable lack of nexus between the instant prosecution and legislative intent in enacting the scam act the question can arise as to why the $$$ chose to investigate and prosecute the instant case. this question has a clear answer that the $$$ chose to pursue the instant case and other cases in which pw had acted on behalf of a- in new delhi in transactions with public sector undertaking to intimidate and blackmail pw for not supporting a- 's public declaration from $$$$ onwards that he had paid the sum of rs. crore to the then prime minister at his residence in delhi in simple words if pw -a vital witness in a- 's allegation against the them pw -supported the allegation of a- then he would be prosecuted along with accused no. in the instant case and other cases. if he cooperated and did not support a- he would be granted a pardon in the said cases. the forum in which the cooperation of pw was sought for was in proceedings before the jpc which inter alia was to inquire into a- 's allegation against $$$ the then prime minister. following consequences of events conclusively establish the quid pro quo referred to between the $$$ and pw.in $$$$ pw met the then director $$$. this is admitted by pw. the director told him that if he wanted to disclose something he should meet mr. pc sharma the then dig special investigation wing.pw met mr. sharma on a number of occasions thereafter.jpc was informed by mr. sharma that pw was sent to him as a source. what was the source disclosed to mr. sharma has not been revealed by the latter to the jpc as he did not want to betray his source.notwithstanding the fact that pw met the cbi as a source a preliminary enquiry was registered in the instant case on..members of the jpc in a separate note have described this change in status of pw.on th $$$$ a- 's advocate addressed a letter to cbi about cash withdrawals from banks in bombay and delhi $$$$ and $$$$ which according to him were politically sensitive in the extreme and stated that details of these would be revealed if a- was given assurance of complete protection from political harassment or prosecutiong although the cbi replied a- 's letter on.to the effect that it was beyond their power to grant such protection they continued to make efforts in march to obtain a- 's narration on the said cash withdrawals. it is only after they failed to obtain such a narration that the fir in the instant case was filed on..the fir of dated.did not cite pw as an accused despite the fact that pw was cited as an accused in the fir. io pw says that decision to name pw in the fir was that of the superintendent of police v.d. $$$ and the investigating agency and that he had to agree with that decision. further they decided not to cite pw as an accused in the fir.the evidence of $$$ as a court witness completely corroborates the fact that the fir was registered not because the investigating agency had applied its mind and such application had revealed to it that the case prima facie disclosed offences which deserved to be investigated but was to extort pw 's support in connection with the conditional disclosures that a- offered to make. thus in his cross -examination on behalf of a- he does not even remember the following-(i whether he questid a- before the fir was registered;(ii whether he interrogated any of the other accused in the instant case before the fir was registered;(iii whether he interrogated pw;(iv whether he discussed the matter with the io;(v whether the io submitted any written report on the outcome of the preliminary $$$ whether at the time of registration of the fir he had determined the role of pw;(vii why pw was not named as an accused in the fir which came to be registered;(viii whether he personally referred to any documents before deciding to register the fir. all the above circumstances reveal the non -application of mind which the investigating agency displayed in filing the fir. the only circumstance that$$$ recalls is that the decision to lodge the fir was a unanimous.the investigation concluded on.when the io pw recommended the prosecution of all the accused including pw. although the investigation had ostensibly concluded no charge sheet was filed. obviously the cbi was awaiting the outcome of the event.the jpc prepared its report in december. in $$$$ the said report was made public. the report disclosed that pw fulfilled his part of the bargain with the cbi refusing to support a- 's public claim that the cash withdrawals made by him in $$$$ were utilized for paying a sum of rs. crore to the which claim became public by virtue of a press conference held on..in $$$$ after the publication of jpc report a charge -sheet was filed in a case dealing with the funds of power finance corporation in which a- and pw were cited as accused.on.pw

attempt to wilfully suppress material and politically sensitive documents in the case all indicate that the present case far from sub -serving the objects for which the special court was established is a colossal waste of public time and my a travesty of justice and an unfortunate reminder of how individuals subvert our criminal justice system by causing institutions like the cbi to file cases which are only vehicles to subserve their own private interests. lastly the learned senior counsel for a- submitted that not only a- and others charged alongwith him be acquitted of all charges but strictures against the investigating agency for bringing the system of criminal justice administration into disrepute be passed. before dealing with the contentions raised by the learned counsel for a- and cbi and before narrating submissions made by the counsel for rest of the accused we would refer to a. allegations in the fir and charge -sheetb. relevant part of the report of the joint parliamentary committee jpc.a. allegations in the fir and charge -sheet. the fir was recorded on.by the cbi after preliminary inquiry which started on.wherein it is inter alia stated as under:--(i during jan.to $$$$ $$$ was functioning as dy. manager finance and $$$ $$$ was functioning as sr. $$$ecutive in the corporate finance cell at the corporate office of mul new delhi and they were having control and dominion over the surplus funds of mul which they were handling for investments with various agencies. these investments were being made in each case with the specific approval of a sub committee for investments consisting of shri r.c. $$$ then cmd mul and s. natrajan then director finance mul. during this period mul was a public sector undertaking and these officials were public servants.s / shri $$$ and $$$ entered into a criminal conspiracy during the period from $$$$ to $$$$ at delhi and bombay with v.n. deosthali an officer of uco bank hamam street $$$anch bombay r.n. $$$ of $$$ bank delhi and sh. $$$. $$$ a broker his employee $$$ and certain other unknown persons with the object to misappropriate the said surplus funds of mul and to provide pecuniary advantage to sh. $$$. $$$ out of the funds to be invested by mul by abusing their official position as public servants.in pursuance to the said criminal conspiracy shri v.n. $$$ wrote a letter on.to mul to effect physical delivery of lacs units of uti to sh. $$$ the attorney of sh. $$$. $$$ and an amount of rs was credited to the account of mul in bank of america at delhi out of the account of sh. $$$. $$$. this amount was borrowed by mul at higher interest rate of.% per annum for $$$$s against physical delivery of lac units of uti. the physical delivery of lac units was taken by sh. $$$ on the basis of receipt given by sh. $$$ on the letter head of sh. $$$. $$$. after expiry of $$$$s the principal amount together with interest totalling to rs. was refunded by mul on.for this refund sh. $$$ obtained banker 's cheque in favour of $$$ bank out of the account of mul in $$$ sansad marg new delhi and the cheque was delivered to sh. $$$ an employee of sh. $$$. $$$. although the said cheque was in the name of $$$ bank shri r.n. $$$ officer of $$$ bank sansad marg new delhi with oblique motive credited the same into the account of shri $$$. $$$ and then transferred it to his account in bombay.the transactions of $$$$ th march and th $$$$ are referred to in para. the said paragraph itself recites $$$$ and the rate of interest. for these investments banker 's cheques were obtained by s / shri $$$ and $$$ from the account of mul in $$$ sansad marg new delhi in the name of $$$ bank and the same were collected by $$$ who deposited the same into the account of shri $$$. $$$ in $$$ bank sansad marg new delhi. as these banker 's cheques were in the name of $$$ bank they should have been credited into the account of the bank but shri r.n. $$$ in connivance with his co -conspirators credited the same into the account of shri $$$. $$$ unauthorisedly. on reversal of these investments the amounts were credited in the account of mul from the account of shri $$$. $$$. for the above investments shri v.n. deosthali issued bogus bank receipts unauthorisedly in pursuance of the said conspiracy. with regard to the transaction dated.similar averments are made in paragraph.the enquiry into the said pe disclosed that mul delhi during the said period had invested its huge surplus amounts with other banks and public sector undertakings on higher rate of interest. similarly during the same period other public sector undertakings had invested their funds at much higher rates then the rate of interest on which mul had made aforesaid investments.vi s / shri $$$ and $$$ in pursuance of said conspiracy misappropriated funds of mul by abusing their official position as public servants in as much as they invested the funds of mul at lower rate of interest and thereby caused pecuniary advantage to the co -conspirators and corresponding loss to the mul. in the charge -sheet submitted on.similar allegations are reiterated. $$$ senior counsel mr. $$$ pointed out that paragraph of the charge -sheet expressly confirms that the transaction was loan transaction inasmuch as it is averred that mul borrowed the amount at a higher rate of interest i. at.% per annum for $$$$s against physical delivery of lacs units of the uti paragraph of the charge -sheet referring to the transaction of th march describes it as an investment of crores and odd from mul for $$$$ $$$$s at the interest rate of.% per annum. paragraphs and contain similar description of the remanning transactions. para of the fir is the basis for conspiracy during the period from $$$$ to $$$$. from the contents of the fir it appears that a- and a- were investing surplus funds of mul with various agencies. these investments were made in each case with the specific approval of sub -committee for investment consisting of mr. rc $$$ the then chairman and managing director cmd mul and s. natrajan then director finance mul. allegation in the fir is that for the transaction mul borrowed the amount at higher rate of interest of.%. with regard to the remaining transactions it is alleged that mul gave funds to a- at a lower rate of interest and thereby pecuniary advantage accrued to the borrowers and mul suffered corresponding loss. same is the position in the charge -sheet. further there can not be any dispute that the fir and the charge -sheet is the basis in a warrant triable case. charges were also framed on the basis of fir as well as other material produced by the investigating agency. the cbi itself understood that mul should have received more interest than it actually received. the charge -sheet nowhere states that at the time of lodging of the fir the nature of these transactions was misunderstood. further in the fir as well as in the charge -sheet it is stated that conspiracy between the accused for the alleged transaction took place during the period from $$$$ to $$$$.b. relevant part of the report of joint parliamentary committee jpc. jpc noticed the findings of janakiraman committee 's report submitted in $$$$ that unscrupulous brokers in collusion with certain bank officials had manipulated securities transactions of banks and financial institutions for their own purpose in a variety of ways and in clear violation of the established rules guidelines and prudent business practices. parliamentary committee also noticed i number of irregularities including extensive use of $$$s for ready forward transactions ii issuance of number of $$$s on the basis of outstanding $$$ and issue of $$$s having no backing of securities iii facilitating the brokers to take temporary position in government securities without involvement of their funds by putting the transactions through brokers account and issuing $$$s on behalf of brokers. for the $$$s the committee observed as under:-.the instruments widely misused in the irregular transactions were bank receipts $$$s subsidiary general $$$ sgl transfer forms and bankers cheques. $$$ is a non -transferable unstamped trust receipt issued by a bank selling securities when it is not able to effect physical delivery of the securities sold even after the receipt of the purchase consideration for reasons such as the securities are lying at another center. in terms of the b.r.the seller bank undertakes to hold the security on trust for the purchaser for the short period till delivery and it is generally considered valid for $$$$s or till delivery is effected whichever is earlier. in the inter bank market a large number of transactions in securities were being concluded by means of $$$ deliveries instead of physical delivery of securities sold however there was no uniformity in the format of the $$$ and there were also not set guidelines for its usage. b.r. does not find a place in the banking regulation act. it was only on the th $$$$ that iba issued a circular prescribing a format and laying down certain broad guidelines and recommending its adoption by member banks and other financial institutions like idbi / ifci / icci / nabard etc. the $$$ for the time inter alia issued instructions to banks in this regard in their $$$ of.appendix -ix. a similar receipt issued by a non -banking financial company is termed security receipt sr and such receipts also came to be freely used in security transactions.the committee is led to the conclusion that the $$$ system has been considerably misused. every step should therefore be taken to prevent recurrence of such things in future. there is need for reforms of the $$$ system for example by way of reduction in the period of its validity and imposing of severe penalties for its misuse.manipulations to favour $$$okers crediting of cheques to $$$okers ' accounts.the scrutiny of securities transactions in a number of banks revealed that some banks were even handing over account payee cheques drawn in favour of other banks to the brokers who got them credited to their account ostensibly to assist the latter in transferring funds quickly to meet their obligations. as per informal understanding and in the name of market practice the payee -bank used to credit the proceeds to the accounts of the broker constituents who brought the cheque to it for collection. these practices were in gross violation of the instruction that the accounts of banks with $$$ should be utilised only for genuine inter bank transactions and not for transfer of funds to their clients. the total amount diverted to the brokers accounts and the ultimate disposal of funds has not been determined. some instances are however given below.in respect of investment transactions between pfc and uco bank during the period $$$$ to $$$$ bankers cheques totalling rs.crores were unauthorisedly issued in favour of $$$ which were irregularly credited to the account of hsm.routing of transactions.many brokers e.g. hsm $$$ adn $$$cel & co.nka etc. used some of the banks as routing banks which carried large volume of securities transactions for them. thus andhra bank uco bank bok bank of madura and abfsl carried transactions of the value of over rs. crores for brokers and others during $$$$ to $$$$. these banks thus provided special privilege to a select few brokers by lending their names to the transactions of these brokers totally disproportionate to the income derived and exposed themselves to great risk by irregularly issuing their own $$$ or sgl transfer forms against $$$ received or to be received in their favour.single point clearance.in the case of sbi it was noticed that hsm had been unauthorisedly given the facility of collection and credit of the bankers cheques by sbi as per his instructions. the bombay main $$$anch of sbi acting as the agent of sbi caps had debited sbi caps account and unauthorisedly credited funds to the account of hsm instead of making payments to named banks / institutions. cheques drawn on uco bank had been credited to the current account of the same broker.the committee noticed in this connection that hsm had requested the bombay main $$$anch twice by his letter dated.and.for acceptance of bankers cheques from banks / organisations brought by him or his representative and issuance of bankers cheques there against. in fact the broker wanted that the facility of single point clearance whereby the activities of issuance and acceptance of bankers cheques in their account may be conducted through the securities division of the sbi main $$$anch bombay instead of the personal banking division in the same branch where he had the account. this facility had enabled hsm to put through the transactions through the securities division itself and also to get bankers cheques in favour of sbi credited to his account and issue of cheques against the credits. the sbi in a note furnished to the committee stated that the letter dated.was not traceable but the letter dated.did make a reference of the same. the committee however obtained a copy of the letter dated.from hsm. in this letter hsm while requesting for the facility of obtaining bankers cheques against presentation of bankers cheques in bank 's favour argued that there would be no outlay of any funds by the bank. on the contrary a good amount of sum will be left in current account for the bank to enjoy the float.in his letter dated.the broker repeated his request and stated:"to facilitate a single point clearance we have to request you to let the activities of issuance and acceptance of banker 's cheques be conducted by the securities division. this will facilitate us to meet the deadlines of inter -bank clearing timings.the committee note that the psus were the single largest source of surplus investible funds around rs. crores between $$$$ and december only. in the investment of these funds guidelines and instructions were routinely flouted and no norms were observed. neither $$$ nor the ministries concerned took any steps to ensure the compliance of their guidelines. even the ministry of petroleum and natural gas which had made a review of investment of surplus funds by the psus under its administrative control in $$$$ closed its eyes knowing fully well that psus were investing with the foreign banks despite the guidelines of $$$ that psus could have normal banking transactions only with nationalised banks.placement of funds for short periods-.the psus have placed funds with banks and finance companies for very short periods sometimes for $$$$ and even for $$$$ implying supply of funds for speculative purposes to earn higher return. these banks / finance companies issued $$$s for the amount received. the psus after the maturity of investments returned the $$$s and got their mys along with the yield which was agreed to at the time of placement of funds. thus these transactions were in the nature of ready forward deals instead of genuine investment transactions which was in contravention of $$$ guidelines issued on.which stated that sale and purchase of securities with the same party and for identical or similar amounts were construed as tacit arrangements which was in contravention of the instructions prohibiting but back arrangements with non -bank clients.diversion of funds to $$$okers-.while most of the psus / organisations denied before the committee about utilising the services of brokers the committee found that in some cases inquiries / investigations by cbi / internal auditors clearly established nexus between brokers officers of psus/ banks resulting in syphoning of funds of psus to brokers. it is reported that psus had placed funds to the extent of over rs. crores through $$$. $$$ which were syphd of to him and his groups of companies. some instances are given below:-(i...in the case of $$$ udyog limited it was found that funds of mul meant for purchase of units from uco bank were credited into the individual accounts of hsm. there is a financial involvement of rs.crores.iii......on th $$$$ shri harshad$$$ held a press conference in which he issued a copy of an affidavit of th $$$$ and briefed the press of the details of the specific withdrawals of and th $$$$ and its subsequent disbursement. in a press conference held on $$$$ he released a copy of an affidavit dated th $$$$ alleging that these were in connection with payment of rs. crore to the p.m. on..hsm was summd by the committee again on.. during evidence when his attention was drawn to the inherent contradictions between what he had deposed before the committee earlier and that given in the press conference he stated that he had been discrete about the information given by him to the committee. from the aforesaid part of the report it is apparent $$$$ some banks were even handing over account payee cheques drawn in favour of other banks to the brokers who got them credited to their account ostensibly to assist the latter in transferring funds quickly to meet their obligations. as per informal understanding and in the name of market practice the payee banks used to credit the proceeds to the accounts of the broker constituents who brought the cheque to it for collection.routing of transactions facility was given to many brokers including a-.single point clearance claimed by a- and given by sbi.psus were investing the funds against the guidelines and instructions.psus were investing funds for short periods for $$$$ and even for $$$$ implying supply of funds for speculative purposes to earn higher return.in the investment of these funds guidelines and instructions were routinely flouted and no norms were observed. neither $$$ nor the ministries concerned took any steps to ensure the compliance of their guidelines.relevant part of evidence-. in the present case the evidence runs into more than volumes. however at the time of hearing of this matter on behalf of a- transactions in question are admitted. hence it is not necessary to refer to or consider the evidence pertaining to the transactions in question. if the prosecution and defence had concentrated on the real issues for determination before the special court it would have saved the court 's time in recording evidence at such a length. unfortunately a practice is developed in criminal / civil cases not to admit any document and thereby to prolong the litigation with impunity. for the purposes of deciding these appeals it is necessary to only refer to relevant part of evidence which learned counsel for the parties have relied upon. for this purpose we would divide the evidence and submissions as under:-- on behalf of]-(a mul;(b uco $$$ other relevant witnesses such as pw $$$ pw $$$. $$$ approver and pw i.o. etc.a witnesses from mul pw pw and pw]. pw $$$ijendra singh $$$ stated that he was legal advisor of mul and at the relevant time company secretary and also internal legal advisor for the company. it is his say that during $$$$ to $$$$ mr. r.c. $$$ was the managing director and $$$. natrajan was the director finance. during the said period mul has several bankers such as $$$ bank of america and bank of tokyo. at that time a- $$$ was deputy manager corporate finance and of his duties was deployment of funds of mul. he had power and authority to sign cheques on behalf of mul and to operate its account. mr. s. natrajan was superior officer to a-. a- was also an employee of mul since. it is his say that surplus funds available with mul used to be invested with the public sector undertakings and the board of directors had delegated the powers of deployment of funds to the sub -committee constituted by it. such sub -committee comprised of managing director and director finance which would have final say in the deployment of funds but there was a practice reporting the same to the board of directors in its meeting. the corporate finance department used to put up proposal for fund deployment before sub -committee. the sub -committee would then take decision way or the other. he has produced relevant documents and the resolutions passed by the board as well as the sub -committee. it is his say that he was broadly aware of the activities of funds investment committee for the placement of funds. his office was also a section of corporate finance which was located in a big open hall and they all were sitting adjoining to each other. only the director finance was having closed cabin in the said hall which has transparent glasses. it is his further say that the fact that mul was having surplus funds was well known in the finance market and the large amount used to remain ideal in the bank. company felt that there was need of optimum utilization of surplus funds to get best possible returns. it is his say that transactions of investment were approved by the sub- committee consisting of mr. r.c. $$$ and mr. s. natrajan and there was also discussion with him in respect of dis -investment of units of uti on th $$$$. it is his say that the investment and dis -investment transactions were placed before board of directors for information and board had not raised any objection. in cross -examination when he was asked whether he was aware that the representatives of the brokers representing the counter parties used to contract officials of the corporate finance department he stated according to him the director of finance might be knowing about the same. he also admitted that there was a system of internal audit and a statutory audit and aforesaid transactions would be covered by the same. $$$ and $$$ of india had also audited the account of mul for the period in question and they had made their comments as nil which means they made no comments in respect of said transactions. he admitted that mul has not lodged any complaint / fir with the cbi nor made any complaint to any about the said transactions and according to him no loss was caused to the mul in the said transactions. he admitted that after cbi enquiry the management of mul did not take any action against a and a as it felt that a- and a- were not guilty. the performance of a- was appreciated and he was subsequently promoted to the next level. he was also granted additional increment. for that purpose the relevant letters written by mr. r.c. $$$ chairman -cum -managing director of mul are produced on record. he has also admitted that a- ambuj $$$ was also promoted by the management on considering his performance and merits. he further admitted that joint parliamentary committee jpc was constituted by the parliament for the purpose of inquiring into various securities transactions and mul was required by the jpc to clarify certain queries in respect of its securities transactions including those transactions which are subject matter of this case. it is his say that he was associated along with director finance mr. a.r. halasyam and mr. r.c. $$$ chairman -cum -managing director for the preparation of the reply to be given to the jpc. besides some officials from corporate finance were also associated in the process of preparation of replies. $$$ was based on the information and record furnished and made available by corporate finance. it is his say that mr. r.c. $$$ was summd by jpc. next witness from mul -pw mr. agharam ramakrishnan halasyam was the general manager finance since till the end of in he was promoted as chief general manager finance and thereafter was promoted as director finance from st $$$$. according to him in mul used to have surplus funds which were invested in uti and psu bonds. it also disinvested the same when funds were required. this was d by the corporate finance cell. for this purpose corporate finance cell used to get quotations from different banks for different kinds of securities and finance cell used to evaluate quotations received from the banks in terms of yields. after such evaluation director finance used to be apprised and then a decision would be taken depending upon the best yield possible. $$$ an agenda used to be put up to the director finance for a final decision and that a- used to convey such offers to director finance orally. a- also used to put -up a written note about the proposals of investments before the director finance. it is his say that such deals were directly discussed with the counter party and such investment deals were not put through any individual by mul on principal to principal basis. he stated that in respect of transactions being the subject matter of this case he was not having any personal information. however when he took over as a director finance the same policy about the placement of funds continued. it is also his say that $$$ held by mul is discharged when the duration of investment gets over. he admitted that looking at the $$$ of uco bank $$$.dated.for identification no suspicion would arise on the face of it. with regard to all transactions he stated the same thing. in further cross -examination he admitted that issuance of $$$ necessarily indicates that the bank issuing it would be holding the security covered under the said $$$. the $$$ would also acknowledge the receipt of monies from mul for the purchase of security. he further agreed that in respect of transactions dated th march th march and th $$$$ the payments made from mul were for buying securities and securities were received and the subsequent delivery of the securities involved receipts of payment by mul. for these transactions mul had also received the payments with agreed yield. in the last transaction of $$$$ mul made payment for the purchase of securities. in the said transaction mul had received my with agreed yield. in respect of disinvestment transaction dated.mul delivered the securities against the payment and on reversal received the securities and made the payment. he further admitted that mul had not suffered any mtary loss in any of the transactions. in the transactions there was optimum yield and utilization from the point of investment by mul. mul used to have large amount of surplus funds for investment. $$$$ there used to be such investment transactions for and on behalf of mul on short term basis. this fact was well known in the financial market. he also admitted that after he took over as director finance he heard about some of the brokers on behalf of some financial institutions / banks making offers to mul. such services included delivery of securities delivery of $$$s. he further stated that essentially most of the offers in respect of placement of funds which mul used to receive were on teleph. in case of investment for a short period i. for $$$$ for or weeks there might not be written proposal and he had heard this while discussing with a- and a-. he also admits that with regard to the jpc he was concerned with the queries received by the mul and their response. mr. $$$ was then the concerned secretary. he was a director of mul representing government of india. he himself and the managing director had occasion to discuss with him about the queries received as also the response that mul was to make. response which mul gave was with the approval of mr. singh. this witness has proved the agenda notes and resolutions passed by the sub -committee of mul. prosecution has also examined $$$. $$$ecutive who at the relevant time was posted as accountant and working in corporate finance cell under a- and a-. in examination -in -chief the witness has stated that mul through its finance cell used to deploy its surplus funds in inter corporate deposit with $$$s and also invest in securities through $$$ and also through brokers quoting on behalf of the banks. for this purpose the office was receiving teleph calls directly from the banks as also from brokers acting on behalf of the banks. similarly mul also used to make calls for the enquiries to the banks as also the brokers. it is his say that in case of incoming calls the calling party would disclose its identity and would inquire about a- or a-. in case both being busy then he used to take down the particulars furnished by the calling party and then pass on to a- or a-. the calling party would ask whether mul has any surplus funds for deployment in securities. they used to pass on the said message to a- or a- and inform what the other party had offered. he also states that the names of broker did not figure or reflect on the record of mul in the event of transaction of investment being through the $$$oker. it is his further say that pw mr. $$$ who was the concerned manager of the $$$ after preparing bankers ' cheque as per their instructions would hand over the same to him and he in turn used to hand over the cheque to the representative of the said bank or brokers ' representative. it is his say that because of pressure of work they were not going to the respective banks and instead handing over the bankers cheque to the representative of the bank or to the broker under the instructions of either a- or a-. in cross -examination he admits that during the relevant period foreign banks used to effect transfer of monies from city to another much faster than the national banks and they were able to do so during of the same $$$$. he came across transactions where sbi capital market services had d transactions both of receiving monies and paying it to them on the date of maturity which payments were made or reused through bank of america. he further states that the brokers who used to contact them on behalf of their bank clients and financial institutions during the relevant period were:-- dsp financial services hemdev deals in the security transactions in case where such transactions were on behalf of their bank and the same used to be concluded by the head office. the transactions in securities included both sale of such securities by uco bank as also purchase. it was only the head office which was concluding deals of sale of the securities inviting the proposals etc. as per instructions of the head office hamam street branch used to receive the sale proceeds and deliver the securities to the purchasing bank. the branch used to receive instructions in respect of such concluded deals from the head office over teleph. during the relevant period there were no hard and fast rules and any officer including the witness used to receive such telephonic instructions from the head office in respect of security transactions. the securities sold by their bank were not delivered in a physical form and their branch used to issue mostly sgl forms. in case of some of the financial institutions the delivery used to be in a physical form of security. during his tenure in hamam street $$$anch in or cases $$$s were issued. as per format of a $$$ at least authorized officers were required to sign the $$$. there were types of head office accounts with their branch i. director head office dho inter $$$anch transaction and block account. it & sons. b.d. agarwal & co. and mr. $$$. finally he admits that writing contained on all the vouchers and its language was his and he used expression as either through uco bank or through $$$ bank because transactions in question were between mul and the concerned banks. he failed to give any explanation as to why he did not use the expression with bank instead of through bank"b witnesses from uco bank pw pw pw and dw.a-( and pw from canara bank. pw mr. pradip anant karkhanis is a dismissed employee of uco bank. he is of the accused in a security scam related case being case no. of pending on the file of sessions court greater bombay. he had worked in the hamam street $$$anch during the period $$$$ to september and september to $$$$. during his posting he worked as sr. manager and was over all in -charge of the said branch. it is his say that he was not familiar in detail with the working of the security department of the said branch. the security department used to attend the security transactions on behalf of the head office as also on behalf of the clients which also included brokers. the branch was not concluding was not permissible to use the said accounts for any individual. while working in hamam street $$$anch sometimes he came across few brokers including $$$. $$$ whom he met once in his office along with mr. s.v. ramnathan the then $$$ manager of the bank. he never came across transactions known as buy back or ready forward. he came across transactions known as switch transactions wherein security is received from bank and delivered to the other bank. during the relevant time a doubt was entertained in respect of switch transactions the zonal manager and $$$ manager took the decision to stop the said practice. after week the $$$ manager phd hamam street branch and asked them to resume such transactions. accused no. was not authorized to conclude transactions in security on his own on behalf of the bank. on seeing the letter dated rd $$$$ addressed to mul containing signature of a- it is his say that it was not within the authority of a- to address such letters. he agreed that switch transactions were the transactions conducted by the uco bank for buying and selling the securities on behalf of its clients including brokers. the negotiations in respect of such transactions were conducted by the clients directly with the counter party. uco bank used to act as a routing bank in such transactions. the said transactions were d through the brokers ' accounts and were not treated as transactions of uco bank. he did not know whether such transactions were ever undertaken by their head office. the hamam street branch used to conduct its transactions on the instructions of the head office and under the instructions of its clients on their behalf. uco bank used to undertake such transactions on behalf of its clients on charging its commission and that the bank had made substantial profit by undertaking such transactions. in he noticed that the bank has conducted such transactions for about brokers. in $$$$ mr. barve who was also of the managers in hamam street $$$anch informed the $$$ manager and zonal manager the names of such brokers for whom uco bank was doing switch over transactions. because of increase in deposits hamam street $$$anch of uco bank was upgraded from medium to large branch. he has further stated that the bank was charging the commission for routing such switch over transactions but did not agree that it was so doing for leading its name as suggested. according to him routing transaction means uco bank used to receive bank receipts from bank and against it the bank used to issue $$$s to other bank. it is also his say that in some cases their bank received bankers cheques from bank and uco bank issued its bankers ' cheques to another bank. whenever switch over transactions used to take place under the instructions of the brokers the brokers ' instructions to receive or deliver securities were sent to the counter party along with the cost memos and $$$s. the $$$s and cost memos used to be of uco banks. the brokers instructions used to be on the letter head of the broker. the purpose of sending brokers instructions along with various documents to the counter party was to put it on a proper notice. it is his further say that although he was overall in charge of hamam street branch of uco bank all the debit and credit vouchers of that branch were not being received by him $$$$. he was familiar with what is meant by $$$$ book which was kept and maintained by the bank. all the debit and credit vouchers would be reflected in the said $$$$ book on particular $$$$ including in subsidiary book. such day books used to come to him $$$$. he knew that securities transactions on behalf of brokers were taking place but he had no detailed particulars thereof. by going through the debit and credit vouchers it was not possible to get such details or particulars of such transactions. credit voucher in a security transaction would contain the particular such as a nomenclature of security face value rate etc. the name of the counter party may not necessarily be reflected in such vouchers. he might have seen some credit vouchers but he did not remember. he did not remember whether the names of the counter party were mentid in those vouchers which he might have seen. it is his further say that there used to be to switch over transactions $$$$. the strength of the staff available in the said department was adequate enough to handle the volume of work in such transactions. such transactions were to be completed on $$$$ during . there used to be auditing of the hamam street branch. this auditing used to be d by internal auditors external auditors and also by the statutory auditors. between september to $$$$ during his tenure internal inspection and statutory audit took place in respect of hamam street branch. he had g through both these audit reports and no adverse comments were made over the switch transactions. pw prem shanker $$$ who was assistant chief officer in merchant banking division situated at ywca building madam $$$ bombay stated that in the year he was transferred as manager is security section of hamam street $$$anch of uco bank and thereafter he was promoted as sr. manager in the year. to a question what was the nature of the business conducted by the security cell?,-- he replied as far as hamam street $$$anch was concerned the said branch used to conduct the security transactions on behalf of their head office as well as on behalf of clients. mr. $$$. $$$ was such client. in case of sale transactions on behalf of their clients they used to get written instructions from their clients having necessarily their accounts with the bank. such written instructions would be addressed to the $$$anch manager. the instructions being for the sale of the security they were ascertaining from their

obligations settlement of transactions with $$$ / government settlement of inter -bank transactions or adverse clearing balances. it is reiterated that the accounts maintained with $$$ should be utilised only for these purposes and not for facilitating credit to accounts of parties. it has also been revealed during investigations that banks have credited cheques drawn in their favour by other banks marked account payee to the accounts of constituents even when they are not named in the cheques as the beneficiaries. in the case of cheques not having been drawn in the names of constituents nor containing any direction to pay to the constituents the proceeds thereof or having any other independent direction to that effect the amount can not be paid to the constituent. if any bank credits the account of a constituent who is not the payee in the cheque without proper mandate of the drawer it does so at its own risk and will be responsible for the unauthorised payment. payment systems require that the legal requirements laid down in the various relevant laws are fully observed. in the case of account payee cheques wherein a bank is a payee the payee bank should always ensure that there are clear instructions for disposal of proceeds thereof from the drawer of the instrument. if there are no such instructions the cheque should be returned to the sender. $$$ reiterates the position that crediting of proceeds of such cheques to parties otherwise than in pursuance of clearly delineated instructions of issuer of such cheques is unauthorised and should not be d under any

stated that it was of the significant factors in the investigation that loss had been caused to mul. during the course of preliminary enquiry he had collected information which indicated pecuniary loss to mul. out of the transactions in question the was a borrowing by mul whereas the remaining were lending by mul. the loss was caused to mul because mul paid higher rate of interest in comparison to the rate of interest paid by other psus on borrowings. he does not remember as to what rate of interest was paid by mul but it is mentid in the charge -sheet. he had seen the charge sheet. it does not carry any mention of other psus. there is also no list showing the rate of borrowing by other psus. he admitted that the rate of interest in the market fluctuates from $$$$ and . he investigated on the aspect as to on what rate of interst other psus borrowed on.. he had not recorded the statements of any person from those psus. but he collected the data showing the borrowing rate of interest. he had collected such data from gail. indian oil and ongc etc. but it has not been made part of the charge -sheet the reason being oversight. he stated that it was wrong to suggest that the said data

not involved directly. they were involved not criminally but for approving the proposal put by a- and a-. the proposal put by a- and a- was a criminal act. mr. bhargav and mr. natrajan were not aware that the investment in fact has been made with a- through uco bank. mr. bhargav and mr. natrajan and bonafidely accepted the proposal put up by a- and a-. a- and a- were the person who were responsibel for investing the amount with the banks for the benefits of mul. the approval by mr. bhargav and mr. natrajan was with the application of mind. following questions was put to the witnessq.

so far as this document is concerned the funds were placed through uco bank and not to uco bank. similarly in $$$. the word used in through. in these documents even after the use of the word through his conclusion was that the placement of funds by mul was with uco bank and no with a person. the witness further clarified that the placement of funds was with uco bank which offered the sale of units available with them and the contents of the resolutions in $$$. and $$$. should be read with the agenda note and the letter of offer by uco bank. according to him after the placement of funds

financial services for investment in bonds / units / government securities. he denied that he and the investigating agency have protected mr. bhargav and mr. natrajan. he could not remember if he had recommended the prosecution of mr. bhargav and mr. natrajan or that the investigating agency rejected that recommendation for extraneous reasons.the decision to name $$$ in the fir was of mr. $$$ and the investigating agency and he had agreed. the decision to drop him from the list of accused was his and that of investigating agency. after recording statement of m. $$$ under section cr.p.c. it was

to the evidence of the case which he has registered as per the fir to this question he replied that he did realise so and thereafter dig mr. $$$ conducted some enquiry with mr. $$$ who revealed that he did not recollect about the donation to the party. dw( $$$ stated that he is dealing with pharmaceuticals and chemicals since about last years. prior thereto he was in the employment of a- from june till june. he was asstt. vice president and looking after settlement of my market transactions of a-. he used to sit at nariman point office bombay of a-. he then stated that deals in my market transaction in security transactions used to take place during $$$$ for and on behalf of a-. his duty was to confirm about the delivery of the securities both delivery on behalf of a- as also receipt on behalf of other parties. regarding the procedure of settlement of the deals and about his role the witness stated that after feeding the computer the contract notes and delivery orders were generated from the computer and handed over to him. on receipt thereof he used to depute the delivery boys to the concerned banks for the purpose of collecting or receiving the deliveries of the securities. after collecting the securities the same used to be sent to uco bank hamam street branch bombay. the delivery boys would deliver the securities and then collect the bankers cheques from uco bank and deliver again the said bankers cheques to the banks from where they had earlier collected the securities in question. uco bank hamam street branch bombay was giving routing facility for my market transactions to various brokers which included his master a-. he used to do $$$$ reconciliation with uco bank hamam street branch bombay in respect of the security position in the account of a- on teleph. after confirming the position of the balance of the securities in a form of $$$s held by uco bank in the account of a- he would pass on the same to the dealers of a-. without holding the securities by way of $$$s uco bank would not issue $$$s for and on behalf of a-. apart from $$$s the securities in the physical form of a- would also lie with uco bank hamam street branch bombay. whatever securities received either by $$$s sgls or physical for and on behalf of a- the same used to remain with uco bank hamam street branch bombay. there used to be generally surplus balance of securities in the account of a- with uco bank hamam street branch bombay. he agreed to the suggestion that uco bank hamam street branch bombay issued its $$$ in respect of lacs units of uti on.in respect of the transaction favouring mul. he was in bombay when a- was arrested. he was also arrested by cbi in rc case no. he was aware that a- was kept in the cbi custody for well over days. he was not knowing whether a- was under cbi custodial interrogation.alleged conspiracy. in this case conspiracy is the basis for convicting the accused. special court has mainly relied upon the evidence of pw for holding that prosecution has established conspiracy on the basis of so -called meeting between a- a- a- and pw $$$ in $$$$ of $$$$ / $$$$. for conspiracy it is the prosecution version that a to a entered into a criminal conspiracy to siphon -off the funds of mul in favour of a- and afore -quoted transactions took place even though there was a special bar of granting loan by mul to individuals. mr. mahesh$$$ who appeared as amicus curiae for a- submitted that the conspiracy charge is not tenable for the following reasons it is absurd to suggest that the conspiracy took place in and the overt act in pursuance of that conspiracy took place in march. the link between the conspiracy of and the overt act of march is further broken by the fact that other transactions took place in the year between a- and mul. all these transactions have been brought out in cross -examination of pw and the relevant documents have been proved by the defence through their defence witnesses.there can not be a conspiracy to siphon -off surplus funds when the overt acts show that nothing of that kind happened even once monies were lent on security and repaid with interest on the due date.there was effort made to prove this absurd conspiracy based on the sole evidence of the approver pw. now in this very case it has been held by the previous bench that the pardon granted to the approver by the magistrate was invalid. where the pardon granted is without jurisdiction the use of the evidence may not affect the validity of the entire proceedings by reason of the curative provisions of cr.p.c. but certainly the evidence becomes inadmissible. it is significant that the solicitor general during his long arguments never once relied upon the evidence of the approver.the veracity of pw has been destroyed in cross- examination. he denied his taped conversation and feigned ignorance of police statement. he suppressed truth from the jpc. even if the evidence of pw is taken at its face value it does not disclose any conspiracy viz.an agreement to commit an illegal act.it is well -settled that an approver is not worthy of credit and his evidence must be corroborated in all material particulars through independent evidence. the conviction can not be based on sole evidence of an approver. it is submitted that in the instant case there is no corroboration of the so -called conspiracy through any independent evidence in fact the evidence of approver himself does not disclose any conspiracy as alleged in the charge. $$$ senior counsel mr. $$$ also referred to a note recorded by members of jpc wherein it is stated as under:-.. the cbi 's treatment of $$$ as a source and thereafter as an accused is mystifying to say the least. no satisfactory explanation about this was ever forthcoming. it is submitted that from the aforesaid note inference is obvious the registering of preliminary enquiry in this case and other cases was an attempt to threaten pw for not disclosing to the public what he had informed to $$$ dig special investigation wing privately. the registering of the cases had the desired effect pw did not reveal his knowledge to anybody because the agency to whom he had revealed it from june onwards had chosen not to use the information but to investigate cases in which he could be roped in. obviously the filing of cases against pw intimidated him sufficiently not to divulge the information he was aware of. he submitted that this is crystal clear from the evidence of cw mr. v.d. $$$ wherein he has stated that mr. $$$ in his statement dated.disclosed that after withdrawing large amount from the bank. a- along with sunil mittal went at the residence of mr. $$$ congress party treasurer and handed over the said amount to him. to suppress this mr. $$$ was made approver. the learned counsel for all the accused contended that prosecution story of conspiracy between a to a is absurd subsequently developed and cooked up. it is contended that of the purposes for developing the story of conspiracy hatched in the year might be for seeing that the offences are tried by the special court. it is contended that under section the offence which took place between day of $$$$ and on or before th june could only be tried by the special court. the transactions of giving loan by a- on.to mul and borrowing by a- on.which was repaid on.and transaction for which amount was received on.and repaid on.would not be covered by sub -section of section of the scam act. hence it is submitted that the allegation of conspiracy between the accused since apart from being unreliable is cooked up. for appreciating the contention we would refer to the fir which was lodged on.. in the fir in para it has been mentid that--"s / shri $$$ and $$$ entered into a criminal conspiracy during the period from $$$$ to $$$$ at delhi and bombay with v.n. $$$ an officer of uco bank hamam street branch bombay r.n. $$$ of $$$ bank delhi and shri harshad s. $$$ a broker his employee $$$ and certain other unknown persons with the object to misappropriate the said surplus funds of mul and to provide pecuniary advantage to shri harshad s. $$$ out of the funds to be invested by mul by abusing their official position as public servants. similar allegations were made in the charge -sheet which was filed on.which reads as under:--"the investigation has further revealed that $$$ a- and $$$ a- entered into a criminal conspiracy and were member of the same during the period from $$$$ to $$$$ at delhi and bombay with v.n. deosthali a- then asstt. manager uco bank hamam street branch bombay r.n. $$$ a- of $$$ bank new delhi harshad s. $$$ a- a broker and $$$ an attorney of harshad s. $$$ with the object to misappropriate the surplus funds of mul and to provide pecuniary advantage to harshad s. $$$ a- by abusing their official position as public servants. in respect of the aforesaid prosecution story that accused entered into criminal conspiracy during the period $$$$ to $$$$ the prosecution has not led any evidence and it appears that it has given up the said version. on the contrary prosecution led evidence to the effect that there was conspiracy either in $$$$ or $$$$ between a a and a and for that purpose it relied upon the evidence of approver pw $$$. $$$ who was associated with a- for the purpose of carrying out research in share market and companies in delhi somewhere in $$$$ of $$$$ or march. during his visit to delhi in $$$$ / $$$$ a- made reference to mul and told that mul has surplus investable funds as a psu and they were very active in my market. it is the say of pw that a- desired that he should fix an appointment with a- who was the concerned functionary in the investment of the funds by mul. therefore a meeting was fixed in $$$$ of $$$$ / $$$$ which took place in the office of mul in delhi. in the said meeting a- a- and a- were present. in the meeting a- stated that he wanted to deal with mul and that he was having lot of contracts with the banks in bombay and could offer to mul excellent deals in the my market. relevant talk which transpired in the said meeting is as under:-"ans. the accused no. at that time stated that the mul could not deal or involve the brokers. mr. harshad s. $$$ stated that the deals would be between mul and banks structured and suggested by him i. mr. harshad s. $$$. mr. $$$ would not appear in the books of accounts of mul and that is what he stated.ans. mr. harshad s. $$$ stated that he would stand to gain by way of commission and/or brokerage from the banks. he also stated that mul would benefit by getting better deals.ans. the accused no. stated that he would took into any good proposals if mr. $$$ did not come into picture. from the aforesaid evidence it is absolutely clear that there was no conspiracy to indulge in any illegal activity. as per the evidence of this witness a- stated that he would look into any good proposals if a- did not come into picture. this statement would not mean that a- agreed for committing any illegal act or offence. there is no evidence that a- suggested for commission of any illegal act. in further cross -examination this witness has admitted that he was not sure when a- visited new delhi but he visited new delhi once in $$$$ or $$$$ and the meeting took place in the offence of mul at new delhi. the attention of the witness was also drawn to the hand written entry in the visitor 's register of the ongc new delhi for the period.till.which reveals that a- was present in delhi on.and even assuming that a- stayed there for week as stated by the witness his stay would be up to.. on the basis of the aforesaid evidence it has also been rightly contended that the story developed by the prosecution that a- was present during the said meeting is on the face of it absurd. for this purpose it has been pointed out that by an office order dated.$$$.a and $$$.a a- was appointed and thereafter he joined the mul on.as junior officer on probation. he was sent for refresher course from $$$$. in this set of circumstances it would be difficult to believe that a raw junior officer who was on probation would take part in alleged meeting and be a party to conspiracy of dealing in mul funds illegally or irregularly. further pw has developed a story after his arrest on.that a- was present in the meeting. pw has admitted in cross -examination that he was summd by cbi in june for interrogation on occasions i. on.and.. in further cross -examination he admitted that neither he could recollect the exact date and time of the meeting which took place in the premises of mul nor remember $$$$ of the meeting. the witness has also stated that if in the statement recorded by the cbi he has not mentid about the presence of a- in the said meeting then it may be he has not stated about the same. the public prosecutor admitted that it was an omission in the statement recorded by the cbi with regard to the presence of a-. from the aforesaid admission in the cross -examination it is apparent that a- was not present during the meeting and that the prosecution story with regard to the alleged meeting appears to be doubtful. in any case approver pw does not assign any role to a in the said meeting. it is also to be noted that the alleged meeting took place in an open hall where other employees of mul were sitting in close proximity of a- and a- and of the employees was pw- $$$ who joined the corporate finance cell of mul sometime in the year as deposed by him. he stated that he used to work directly under a- and that he himself a- a- and $$$ used to sit in a common hall a- had his table with chairs meant for visitors and by the said of it and in front of him there was a common table where a- used to sit he pw used to sit opposite to a- to the side of a- mr. $$$ used to sit and mr. $$$ used to sit next to him. $$$ he states that while working with corporate finance cell of mul he had not heard the name of $$$ and that he had never seen the said mr. $$$. similarly $$$ who was working in the corporate finance department of mul from to.has not at all deposited about the alleged meeting. the other employee who was also working in the said room is not examined by the prosecution therefore it is submitted that pw has uttered a blatant falsehood when he deposited before the court that alleged meeting took place in the premises of mul in $$$$ or $$$$. if such meeting had taken place as alleged by pw it would have been noticed by $$$ $$$ and other employees. from the aforesaid discussion it is apparent that approvers statement for establishing conspiracy does not inspire any confidence. further the evidence led by the prosecution itself destroys the so -called conspiracy hatched in april / $$$$ because the reply of a as stated by pw in the meeting was limited to the extent that mul could not deal with or involve the brokers and that he would look into any good proposals if a does not come into the picture. from this statement no inference can be drawn that there was any conspiracy to misappropriate mul funds or commit fraud or to commit any illegal act. further for the prosecution version that a and a entered into a criminal conspiracy with other accused between $$$$ to $$$$ as stated in the fir which was recorded after preliminary inquiry and in the charge -sheet virtually filed after more than years of the preliminary inquiry no attempt is made to prove the same. subsequently developed prosecution version that conspiracy was hatched in april / $$$$ on the basis of approver 's evidence appears to be unreliable and baseless,. next question would be even though not argued can we draw an inference from the transactions in question that there was any such conspiracy from $$$$ to $$$$ between accused?. there is no circumstances on record for establishing any conspiracy between a- and a- who was assistant manager of uco bank. there is nothing on record to show that a- or a- had any talk with a- or a- with regard to the alleged conspiracy and that they were party to it. however let us consider that transactions mentid above took place and as mul could not lend my to a- directly the transactions took place under the name of and through uco bank and in transactions uco bank in turn gave the said amount to a-. it is pointed out that as there was conspiracy a and/or a- gave account payee cheques issued by $$$ on behalf of mul payable to $$$ bank to anuj $$$ representative of a-. $$$ bank deposited the said amount in the account of a- at delhi and thereafter transferred the same to the account of a- at bombay. subsequently on $$$$ it was transferred to uco bank and uco bank gave cheque to a-. from the nature of aforesaid transactions whether conspiracy can be inferred it is true that apparently transactions are not simple. it casts serious doubt with regard to functioning of $$$ and mul. but as against this the evidence which is brought on record by the prosecution establishes that these were routing / switch transactions. pw assistant chief officer uco bank has stated that in case of security transactions on behalf of the client they credit the sale proceeds receipt into the account of the client.  karkhanis has specifically stated that hamam street branch on $$$$ used to have -such transactions and such transactions were to be completed within . dw -a( mr. ramnathan who was the divisional manager of uco bank at bombay office has produced on record the letter dated.$$$. written by him indicating resumption of switch transactions and that letter was written after discussing the subject with various authorities including brokers zonal manager and also with general manager and dy. general manager of uco bank. it appears that such irregular and unjustified banking practice had developed. but in view of the evidence for such routing / switch transaction developed by the banks / brokers it can not be inferred that there was any conspiracy between a a and a or a and a. as stated above this irregular practice is also discussed by jpc. the jpc had arrived at the conclusion that scrutiny of securities transactions in a number of banks revealed that some banks were even handing over account payee cheques drawn in favour of other banks to the brokers who got them credited to their account ostensibly to assist the latter in transferring the funds quickly to meet their obligations. this was d as per informal understanding and in the name of market practice. the payee bank used to credit the proceeds to the accounts of the brokers constituents who brought the cheque to if for collection. the jpc also observed that routing of transaction of many brokers including a- had been carried out by banks. the banks were lending their names to the transactions of these brokers and exposed themselves to great risk by irregularly issuing their own $$$s. therefore if this commercial practice was rightly or wrongly developed in various banks or the psus it can not be inferred that there was any conspiracy between the banks and psus or that there was conspiracy between a- a- a- a- and a-. further in the present case there is no evidence on record that $$$s were issued by the uco bank without being backed by the security namely uti units. in this set of circumstances it would be difficult to hold that prosecution has proved the charge of criminal conspiracy under section of ipc against the accused. i would also state that it is not properly understood by the prosecuting agency that by introducing or adding a new story in a criminal prosecution in most of the cases it adversely affects or destroys the prosecution case. not only it creates doubts with regard to that part of the prosecution version but on occasions casts doubt about the motive. $$$ is under our criminal jurisprudence benefit of doubt may go to the accused. once we arrive at the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove the criminal conspiracy the conviction of the accused under section of ipc requires to be set aside.jurisdiction of the special court under the scam act. at the outset it is to be stated that accused were tried under the scam act which was preceded by an $$$ promulgated on th june. in the year of it was noticed that there was a scam in the stock exchange as there was sudden rise or fall of prices in the stock market and large number of persons who were trading in stock exchange were losing their my. some of them were experienced gamblers at the stock exchange and most of them were laymen. as per the statement of objects and reasons of the act large scale irregularities and malpractices were noticed by the reserve bank of india $$$ in relation to transactions in both the government and other securities indulged in by some brokers in collusion with the banks and financial institutions. the irregularities and mal -practices noticed by the $$$ were with regard to diversion of funds from banks and financial institutions to individual accounts of certain brokers. hence the scam act was enacted which provides for establishment of a special court for the trial of offences relating to transactions in securities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. the object of the act is to deal with situation mentid above and in particular to ensure speedy recovery of huge amount involved to punish the guilty and restore confidence in and maintain the basic integrity and credibility of the banks and financial institutions. under section of the scam act special court is to established and or more sitting judges of the high court would have jurisdiction in respect of any offence referred to in sub -section of section of the scam act. section read. appointment and functions of custodian...the custodian may on being satisfied on information received that any person has been involved in any offence relating to transactions in securities after the st day of april and on and before th june notify the name of such person in the official gazette. hence under the act jurisdiction of the special court is limited for offences relating to transactions in securities after the st april and on or before.and the court is required to follow the procedure prescribed by the $$$ of criminal procedure for the trial of warrant cases before a magistrate. $$$ and inter alia provide that the special court would have exclusive jurisdiction to take cognizance of or to try such cases as are instituted before it or transferred to it as provided. further it is to be clearly understood that the act not create any new offence nor brings about any change in the procedure or raises any presumption to an offence punishable under the ipc or p.c. act which is to be tried under the act. therefore the offences pertaining to misappropriation criminal breach of trust or fraud and forgery are required to be established by the prosecution on the touchst of ingredients laid down under the relevant provisions of indian penal $$$ and by following the evidence act. hence for conviction under section and/or section ipc the prosecution is required to establish the ingredients of said sections beyond reasonable doubt. therefore as the prosecution has failed to establish the conspiracy the jurisdiction of the special court would be limited only for the transactions which took place after st april. in the present case only transactions i.dated.and.would be covered.case against a- and a-. in this case as the prosecution has failed to establish criminal conspiracy we are required to consider the prosecution case against each accused for the acts committed by them and to find out whether they have committed any offences. the case of the prosecution against a- and a- is as follows a- and a- misappropriated the property in violation of the law as well as their duty express and implied by making it available for use of a-. this is on account of the fact that they were authorised to invest the my in defined securities in a transaction with $$$s only. they however knowing entered into a series of transactions which had the result of making the funds of mul available to a.a- and a- were also admittedly public servants during the material time. they abused their position and thereby conferred a pecuniary advantage upon a- and in any event while holding office as a public servant obtained a pecuniary advantage for a- against public interest. thus they were charged with an offence under section of the pc act. it is also pointed out that the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses of the mul inter alia establishes the following--(a a- was the deputy manager and a- was senior executive working closely with him.that mul had taken a decision to invest its funds with psus. in fact it was clarified that investment would only be in psu bonds.a used to place the proposals before the board and obtain approvals for the investments in question.mul did not engage services of brokers for its transactions.a- and a- used to give instructions on the basis of which letters addressed to bank were prepared.the banker 's cheques were handed over on the instructions of a- or a- to $$$ an employee of a-.the vouchers prepared in mul clearly suggest that transaction was between mul and uco bank. this has also been stated by pw in his cross -examination. in the circumstances it is submitted that it is very clear that the transaction which was authorised was a transaction in securities directly with uco bank.the fact that the pay order was being given to $$$ bank in a transaction with uco bank was brought to the notice of a- by pw- to which a- 's reply was that it was the problem of uco bank.the contention that a- was instructed by uco bank to issue the pay order in favour of $$$ bank is unacceptable for the simple reason that in the and the transaction pay order continued to be issued to $$$ bank without any direction from uco bank.j in any event there was no authorisation to purchase any securities from any brokers. there was no mention of $$$$ being given on loan to any broker. it bears emphasis that surplus funds were many times invested in securities in buy back transaction in that the arrangement would be to purchase a security and then resell it within a stipulated time after the identified period at a price which would include the cost of purchase plus the stipulated interest. this transaction was considered as placement of funds with psus. the witness have clearly stated that the only authorisation for placement of surplus funds was psus and not private person.charges against a-a he was present in the

respect of transaction between mul and uco bank. a signed the letter being authorised signatory.for charge e)-. no charge has been framed against a in respect of any $$$. since the prosecution had cited document $$$.during arguments before this court the same is being replied to by a- as under:--"a saw this $$$ at the time of discharge as authorised signatory after mul had got the my back and the sanction had got reversed. when pw who was the custodian of all records of every transaction and was maintaining $$$s put up the said $$$ for discharge before a for signing after mul had got the my back he signed the same in a routine manner. under the circumstances it is submitted that no criminality can be imputed against a for signing this $$$ as an authorised signatory after the reversal of the transaction. hence it is submitted that this circumstances also can not be held against a. $$$ senior counsel further submitted that as there is no evidence against a- the special court had rightly acquitted him and in the appeal also learned solicitor general appearing on behalf of cbi has not pointed out any material evidence to hold that the judgment and order passed by the special court calls for any interference in acquittal appeal. he referred to $$$.and submitted that the said document is signed by him but as deposed by pw the said document was authored by pw and approved by a- and therefore it can not be held that he did anything wrong in mentioning in the said letter that cheque may be handed over to $$$. it is his submission that even handing over of cheque to a person who had brought lacs of units for being delivered to mul can not be termed in any way as dereliction of duty. $$$ senior counsel mr. sundaram on behalf of a- has given detailed written submissions and has inter alia submitted that the prosecution has failed to establish that a- mis -represented to the sub -committee of the mul regarding transfer of funds to uco bank on uco bank 's instructions through $$$ bank;b a- mis -represented to the sub -committee by not putting to their knowledge the resolution of the board dated $$$$ the charge of conspiracy is fabricated ;d there was no mens rea for the alleged criminal breach of trust on the part of a-;e in any case it would be totally unjustified to hold that a was having any dominion over mul 's properties. there is no mis -representation nor any loss to the mul. there is no evidence on record suggesting that a- was knowing that the funds were disposed of by uco bank in favour of a-. mul has given funds to the uco bank and it is not the function of mul to verify from uco bank as to how the said funds are utilised;f the charges under the provisions of section of pc act and section of ipc are without any foundation;g the evidence of pw and pw both officials from uco bank have deposed that they could not differentiate whether $$$s and letters pertaining to the relevant transactions shown to them pertain to a transaction conducted on behalf of their bank or on behalf of the client broker andh prosecution has failed to examine material witnesses i.mr. r.c. $$$ chairman -cum -managing director and mr. s. $$$ director finance even though they were available all -throughout and who were examined by the ipc and io.findings:. i would refer to the resolution dated $$$$ of the mul for investment of surplus funds and also the resolutions for investment for the transactions in question which are proved and produced on record. in that resolution the board of mul laid down guidelines for investment of surplus funds by mul which read thus:-"resolution dated.$$$.agenda item no. of surplus funds by mul.in terms of the existing guidelines from the board mul has been loading its surplus funds to central $$$s consistent with the terms and conditions of the approval accorded by the central government under section of companies act.a sub -committee comprising the managing director and director finance has been delegated the authority by the board to facilitate taking faster decision in this regard. the details of investment made are placed in the board meeting for information.of late the number of psus who have surplus funds wanting to loan funds to psus has increased. some psus who were earlier requiring temporary accommodation are now in a position to give funds. as a result of this there is an increasing competition between psus affecting the yield on such loaning of funds.in an effort to maximise yield on surplus funds it is proposed to invest funds in the units of uti central govt. securities public sector bonds either through scheduled banks or directly. these investments at times are expected to fetch a higher rate of return than what is available on loaning of funds to psus without involving any risk as to the return of the principal and/or yield.it is therefore proposed that the board may permit the sub -committee formed by it for the purpose to invest surplus funds of the company from time to time in the purchase of units of uti central government and state govt. securities public sector bonds either through scheduled banks or directly.in march mul invested surplus funds in psu bonds units of uti and central govt. securities as contained in the annexure. the board may kindly accord post facto approval for such investments made to utilise the opportunity of high yield during such periods.the board may kindly approve proposals in para.and.above. much has been contended that the board resolution dated.$$$.passed by the board of directors of mul prohibits granting of loan in favour of individuals and therefore transactions by a- with mul are illegal and against the policy of mul and therefore a- misappropriated even though temporarily the amount of mul. the afore -quoted resolution inter alia provides that it was open to the mul to invest the surplus funds in the uti units through scheduled banks or directly. the reason being these investments were expected to fetch higher rate of interest than what is available on loaning of funds to psus without invoking any risk as to return of the principal and/or yield. it is also provided that board has permitted the sub -committee to invest surplus funds of the company in the purchase of units of uti either though scheduled banks or directly. it is admitted position that on the basis of the resolution sub -committee was constituted consisting of chairman -cum -managing director and director finance for the purpose of investment. it is also proved that all the transactions took place after the sub -committee passed appropriate resolutions.resolutions of the sub -committee. $$$ along with agenda are:--( $$$.dated.$$$.dated.$$$.dated.$$$.dated.and $$$.dated.. relevant part of

an expected yield were received and it was resolved that mul may place funds in units through uco bank as per the proposal. as against this in $$$.dated.which is last resolution it has been specifically mentid that mul may place funds with uco bank in units for $$$$ days as per the request from uco bank. the change of wording in the last resolution clearly indicates that funds were placed with uco bank for investment in units for $$$$ days with expected yield of % p.a. in previous cases if in reality the funds were placed with uco bank then the phrase through uco bank would not have been used. this change of phrase reveals that the nature of transactions was known to the directors and that units were to be purchased for a limited period through uco bank and for the last transaction the amount was placed with uco bank. the afore -quoted resolutions also reveal that when the funds were placed say as with bank of america with m / s infrastructure leasing and financial services limited with $$$ bank and others it has used the word with. however when the purpose is otherwise it has used the word through say as through can bank financial services through bank of america etc. further in the resolutions the period of investment which is $$$$ i. and is mentid. it also mentions expected yield at.% % %.% and % which would indicate that as a matter of fact nature of such transaction was nothing but loan. purpose of having uti units was to secure repayment of loan that is to say in case of failure to repay on due date the units would stand forfeited. it is also clear from para of the resolution $$$.dated st $$$$ that during $$$$ and in $$$$ of january the receipt of payments by mul was relatively less and it was required to borrow funds or withdraw my from psus. however in the documentation the borrowings were required to be shown as sales of investments. the relevant part of resolution reads as under:--..in our documentation we have to show the borrowings as sales of our investment. therefore it is proposed to show such borrowing as reduction in our investments. this has been discussed with company secretary also who is agreeable for such treatment. this would indicate that whatever may be the documentation of purchase or sale of uti units the same would not reflect the true and real nature of transaction. admittedly in the case of borrowing mul was preparing documents so as to reveal that the transactions were sale of investments may be in the uti units or other such securities. further $$$ mr. rajan ramgopal specifically admits that the name of the broker did not figure or reflect on the record of mul in the event of transaction of investment being through broker. he has also admitted that mul was investing its funds in securities through banks and also through brokers quoting on behalf of the banks. further there is nothing on record to indicate that mr. r.c. $$$ chairman -cum -managing director and mr. s. natrajan director finance mul who have passed the resolution for investment of funds did not know that the funds were meant for a-. they were throughout monitoring the transactions in question but are not examined by prosecution for reasons best known to it. this course adopted by a premier investigating agency in such a serious case if there was read fraud or misappropriation appears to be unusual. pw investigating officer mr. bhatnagar has admitted in his evidence that he recorded the statements of mr. r.c. $$$ and mr. natrajan during the investigation to ascertain if any other higher authority of mul was involved in the case and found that they were not involved directly. it is his say that the proposals put up by a- and a- were approved by mr. $$$ and mr. natrajan but they were not aware that the investment in fact has been made with a- through uco bank. they had bonafidely accepted the proposals put up by a- and a-. it is difficult to imagine that superintendent of police cbi would not be aware of the evidence act which stipulates that he can not depose on behalf of aforesaid responsible persons of mul i. the chairman and managing director of mul and director finance of mul. whether they were aware of the fact that investment of the mul funds was with a- through uco bank could have been deposed only by them and not by investigating officer. apart from these salient lapses from the evidence of pw $$$ who was legal advisor to the company it emerges that -the transactions were not only sanctid by the sub -committee consisting of managing director and director finance but were also approved by the board;b brokers representing the counter parties used to contact officials of the corporate finance department and the director finance might be knowing about the same that means mr. s. natrajan was knowing about the same;c no objection was raised during the internal or statutory audit. $$$ and $$$ of india had also audited the account.mul has not lodged any fir nor made any grievance with regard to the said after cbi enquiry a- and a- were promoted for their better performance andf to the jpc necessary replies were given by the board and mr.

june has also stated that(a a- used to put a written note about the proposals for investments before the director finance. with regard to the transactions in question in cross -examination he admits that he did not have any personal information.he admitted that looking at the $$$s of uco bank on the face of it no suspicion would arise and that issuance of $$$s necessarily indicates that bank issuing it would be holding the security covered under the said $$$. the $$$ also would acknowledge the receipt of monies from mul for the purchase of security.he agreed that mul had not suffered any mtary loss in any of the transactions and got optimum yield and utilization from the point of investment by mul.he also admitted that with regard to the queries raised by the jpc he and the managing director had discussed the same and he had given response of mul to jpc after getting approval from mr. singh. in that para -wise reply to jpc it is inter alia sated as under:--"(b. the government has not issued any guidelines in regard to the investment of surplus funds... in an effort to maximise the yield on surplus funds the board of directors in its meeting held on.decided that surplus funds may be invested in the purchase of units of uti central and state government securities and public sector bonds either through scheduled banks or directly. pursuant to this decision mul has been investing surplus funds through scheduled banks / wholly owned subsidiaries of nationalised banks. the sub -committee of the board earlier nominated for psu placements was authorised by the board for investments in these securities. among others the meeting held on.was attended by secretary finance and secretary industry. all the investments were made with the prior approval of the sub -committee and placed before the board for information. to the best of our knowledge $$$ has not issued any guidelines which are applicable to companies incorporated under the companies act for investment of surplus funds. mul has complied with all the rules and regulations prescribed under the companies act for investments of funds. therefore the question of any violation does not arise. or more govt. directors have always been attending the board meetings of mul. there has not been any dissent on any such investments. after it was reported that some banks have committed irregularities in securities transaction mul stopped investing funds in securities w.f..and instead has been placing surplus funds only as inter corporation loans. the investments of these funds were authorised by the

considered to be irregular. no irregularities in investment of funds were ever pointed out in any interim / statutory audit / government audit report. for the time in government auditor 's review of accounts dated th august it was observed that investments through foreign banks were not in conformity with bpe guidelines. in all such transactions of purchase of units funds were transferred to uco bank bombay by way of banker 's cheques in favour of anz $$$ bank strictly in accordance with the written instructions regarding remittance of funds by uco bank bombay. the funds we not credited by $$$ to the individual account of mr. $$$. $$$ had no means to know or any knowledge how uco bank bombay used the funds paid by $$$ for purchase of units. the fact that the funds were credited by uco bank came to the notice of mul in october when cbi stated the enquiry. there is absolutely no connivance between any $$$ official and mr. v.n. deosthali of uco bank or mr. $$$. these investments were made to optimise returns for the company and were made through a public sector bank. $$$ had no reason to suspect that the public sector bank was not doing things in the straight forward manner. in the transaction $$$ sold units worth rs. crores to uco bank bombay and received the my on th january. $$$ thereafter bought back the units after days and the total cost of funds for this period amount to.% per annum. other transactions were for investment of rs.crores rs.crores rs.crore and rs.crores for period of days days days and days with the expected yield of.% %.% and % p.a. respectively. in the circumstances there is no need for the company to take any action.the letters from uco bank bombay were addressed to $$$ udyog limited and were received in the finance department. $$$ udyog limited followed the written instructions of uco bank bombay regarding the remittance of funds through anz $$$ bank. in the case $$$ gave physical delivery of units and received back the same in $$$$ after expiry of days. in respect of other investments which were only for very short periods no physical delivery of units was taken. $$$ received bank receipts from uco bank bombay for all transactions of investment except for the last investment of rs.crores for days in $$$$. these funds were received back alongwith the expected yield. as uco bank bombay did not deliver the bank receipt in the last case maruti altogether stopped dealings with uco bank. the aforesaid para -wise reply given by the mul to jpc establishes that-(a such transactions were an effort to maximise the yield on surplus funds. $$$ is a joint venture company and is to manage as a commercial enterprise with a view to provide its shareholders reasonable return on their equity investments in maruti.the investment of these funds were authorised by the committee of directors consisting of managing director and director finance.the transactions were reported to the board and n of the directors had

$$$.investments were made to optimize return for the company and were made through a public sector bank.funds were received back along with expected yield.in the circumstances there is no need for the company to take any action against the officers. from the aforesaid evidence it is totally misconceived to contend that a- or a- were having any dominion over the mul funds. the aforesaid assertions by the mul before the jpc would certainly mean that a or a have not d anything dishstly with the intention of causing wrongful gain to a or wrongful loss to mul or that chairman and managing director mr. $$$ or the director finance were not knowing about such transactions through uco bank. what can be stated from the evidence discussed above is:--( $$$ used the phrase through uco bank whenever necessary. it also used the words with uco bank or with bank which ever is the bank as per the nature of the transaction.admittedly documents maintained by mul do not reveal true state of affairs. apart from oral evidence this is reflected in the resolution $$$.it is totally misconceived to hold that a- or a- were having any dominion over mul funds / property. funds were to be invested as per the decision of the sub -committee consisting of chairman -cum -managing director and the director finance. they were having dominion over such property. a- or a- were only required to carry out the directions issued by the sub -committee.$$$ passed by the sub -committee were approved by the board. $$$ objected to it.even after inquiry by the cbi in reply given to jpc mul has made it position clear that the funds were invested as a commercial transaction for getting optimum yield. all the witnesses on behalf of mul stated that mul has not suffered any loss in the said transactions.pending cbi inquiry mul considered that a- or a- have not committed any wrong and they were promoted.issuing of cheques by $$$ in favour of $$$ bank was as suggested by the uco bank a-.) further this was a commercial practice adopted by many banks for transmitting the funds at the earliest. this practice rightly or wrongly was developed with the psus and financial institutions.$$$ admits that mul used to invest in certain securities through brokers and the name of the broker did not figure or reflect on the record of mul.in such a case it would be difficult to hold that a- or a- acted dishstly in issuing cheques in favour of $$$ bank for transmitting the funds of ml to uco bank bombay.no objection was raised during internal or statutory audit despite the fact that $$$ and auditor general had also audited the accounts. for the reasons stated above neither a- nor a- can be convicted for the alleged offences. no doubt a- is already acquitted by the special court.case against a-0. before discussing the prosecution case against a i would deal with the prosecution case against a- who was working in the clearing department of $$$ bank new delhi. a- is convicted under section 0b r / w $$$ of ipc and section of the pc act. the appellant was convicted for substantive offence under section ipc for-(a having credited bankers cheque no. dt..for a sum of rs. issued by $$$ favouring $$$ bank into account of a- the amount was paid by a- through uco bank to mul];(b having credited bankers cheque no. dt..for a sum of rs. issued by $$$ favouring $$$ bank into account of a- and(c having

$$$ $$$ and k.k. $$$ and pw mr. v. $$$ an employee of reserve bank of india. it is contended on behalf of prosecution that from the evidence of witnesses of anz $$$ bank the following stands proved -that a- was the officer in charge of the clearing department. pw)b the entries in respect of these transactions would have to be authorised by the officer in charge of the clearing department in view of the amount involved and therefore it would be authorised only by a- pw. mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of a- submitted there is no evidence against accused for the offence for which he is convicted. it is his contention that with regard to the handing over of cheque of $$$ bank there is no evidence except that of $$$ that he accepted the said cheque and forwarded it for encashment. but that would not mean that he was in any way party to any fraud. next he submitted that prosecution witnesses themselves deposited before the court that the cheques received by the $$$ bank were deposited in the account of $$$ bank and not in the account of a-. for this purpose he referred to the evidence of $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ monga pw kanwal $$$. he further submitted that even witness from $$$ pw meda sai swaroop has also deposed that cheques were credited in the account of $$$ bank. he also referred to evidence of pw mr. prem shankar $$$. he relied upon evidence of dw( $$$. finally he has drawn our attention to the evidence of pw mr. b.c. bhatnagar the investigating officer who deposed that there were number of officers involved and referred to the part of pw 's deposition wherein he stated that he does not remember if he had made any application / request for production of documents to the said bank during the said period. he did not remember if he had conducted any search and seizure from the said bank with regard to the documents like attendance registered duty roster or any other similar document showing the presence of particular officer at particular time. for considering the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the parties i would refer to what emerge from the evidence of the relevant witnesses:--. $$$ states that the cheques so received by the anz $$$ bank for clearance were sent to the clearing department for further processing. the said department would verify and tally the particulars as appearing in the pay in slip and the related cheque. the centralized branch of anz $$$ bank then would make the consolidated statement and arrange to send the cheques received for clearance to the clearing house of $$$. there is also a category of cheque known as bankers ' cheque that is to say a particular bank issues its cheques in favour of another bank. in such a case the issuing bank can use the format of pay order also. on seeing $$$.he stated that it is inter bank cheque in favour of $$$ bank issued by $$$ bearing payee a / c only and stamped not transferable. there is a rubber stamp of $$$ bank on its reverse indicating that the said bankers cheque is cleared. he states that $$$ bank would dispose -of the proceeds of the said cheque as per the covering letter. he identified a- r.n. $$$ an employee of $$$ bank but stated that he was not aware about his posting during the relevant period i.in the year to.. pw $$$ anant ram monga states that he was overall in -charge of the anz $$$ bank branch along with the manager and in that capacity he used to have supervision over the working of the concerned clearing department. he states that in these types of transactions there are authorizations required the authorization relates to giving credit to the party which is generally given by branch manager marketing department who is known as relationship manager or account manager and the funds manager. the objective of drawing the bankers cheques was to provide speediest or fastest clearance of such instruments which was not possible through other clearing settlements available to the customers namely micr. if the instrument is cleared through micr clearance the customer gets funds $$$$. the other settlement which is high valued settlement which was introduced by $$$ in the year in response to the needs of the business community as a mode of faster settlement also took minimum days to provide clearance of cheques. he was shown entry $$$.  of dated.into the accounts of harshad s. $$$. he stated that the then officer in charge of clearing department had authorized the said entry to be made in the statement of account. he could not recall the name of the said officer who was in charge of clearing department. he agreed that in -there was a practice of crediting the proceeds of the bankers cheques into the account of party other than its payee. however it was extended to only certain high nerth customers like british airways classic financial nizhewan travels and harshad$$$ group which list is not exhaustive and he came across the instances in case of the said parties where their bank had allowed such credits. the $$$ bank had not received any complaint from mul for crediting the amounts of said pay orders to the account of party. he was asked about the category of customers regarded as high nerth customers. he replied such classification is generally given by the concerned manager of the bank having regard to the deposits maintained by the customer or other business potentials. the services to be extended to the customers like high nerth customers would be decided by the branch manager. in the cross -examination it is his say that all the pay orders which were shown to him being $$$.and were sent for inter bank clearance by the $$$ bank. the amount of these pay orders was debited into the account of the issuing bank and credited into the account of $$$ bank. the accounts of the issuing bank and payee were with the $$$. he admitted that it is only after credit of the proceeds of the said pay orders into the $$$ bank account that the proceeds thereof in turn were credited into the account of a-. he further stated that during the relevant period i. in the year -to his knowledge some other banks in this country were also following such practice. there was no prohibitory order direction or guidelines from the $$$ prohibiting the banks to follow such practice during the relevant period i. -. he stated that $$$ was required to issue guidelines prohibiting such practice somewhere in september / october as many banks were indulging in such practices. it is his say that $$$ has never taken any action against the $$$ bank in respect of pay orders shown to him earlier. he also stated that $$$ bank had not received any complaint from mul for crediting the amounts of said pay orders to the account of party. it is his say that $$$ bank has not received any complaint or claim in respect of said pay orders from $$$ uco bank or harshad s. $$$. the said parties have also not initiated any action in any court of law in respect of megotiation of said pay orders at any time. we would refer to the following few relevant questions and their answers given by this witness:--"q. having received the funds under the pay order payee bank would credit its proceeds into the account of the party depositing the said payee order?a. when the instruments like pay order is drawn favouring $$$ bank then the same has necessarily to be deposited into pits i.$$$ bank account with $$$.q. would it be correct to say that if any bankers cheque is made payees account and non transferable then in the ordinary course the payee bank can not credit the proceeds thereof in to the account of party?a. yesq. if your customer gives the instruction for giving credit of the proceeds of such pay order to any party then the same would be permissible?a. yes if the customer is in the list of high nerth. to the court q. you have stated about the category of customers regarded as high nerth customers. could you elaborate?a. such classification is generally given by the concerned manager of the bank having regard to the deposits maintained by the customer or other business potentials.q. such practice being in deviation of the usual practice was the permission of the $$$ obtained as far as your bank is concerned?a. no.q. yes have stated that $$$ issued detailed guidelines somewhere in september -october expressly prohibiting such practice of negotiation does that not mean that $$$ never approved of such practice?a. yes. witness volunteers $$$ never objected to it probably it might not be aware of such practice.all the pay orders which were shown to me being $$$.and were sent for inter bank clearance by the $$$ bank. it is correct that the amounts of the said pay orders were debited into the account of issuing bank and credited into the account of $$$ bank. the account of the issuing bank and payee bank are with the $$$. it is correct that it is only after credit of the proceeds of the said pay orders in to the $$$ bank account that the proceeds thereof in turn were credited into the account of accused no.. pw kanwal $$$ with regard to the credit voucher dt..into the account of harshad s. $$$ states that the same was approved by him and it bears his initials. the entry appearing therein is correct and the same was prepared on the basis of credit advice received from the $$$. he could not recollect who was or who were the concerned officers of the treasury department who would be giving such instructions as there were many such officers. pw v. $$$ states that the bankers cheque / pay order issued by ban favouring other bank are negotiated as under:--"the payee bank would deposit the cheque for clearance in clearing house and $$$ would settle the payment thereof by giving credit into the account of payee with $$$. in view of the aforesaid evidence it can be stated without any doubt that all the pay orders namely $$$.and were sent for inter bank clearance by the $$$ bank. the amount was credited in the account of $$$ bank. hence it is established that the amount of account payee and non -transferable pay orders were only credited in the account of $$$ bank. in this set of circumstances it is not necessary to discuss the relevant provisions of negotiable instruments act that account payee non -transferable cheques can not be credited in anybody else 's account. as such the entire prosecution against was totally on an errous assumption that got the amount of account payee ' cheque bearing stamp non -transferable credited straightaway in the account of a-. if the amount is credited in the account of $$$ bank question is how is liable there is nothing on record to establish who directed that the said amount should be credited in the account of a-. the evidence led by the prosecution nowhere reveals that credited the said amount into the account of a-. io has not verified at whose instance the amount which was credited in the $$$ bank account was specifically credited in the account of a-. the evidence of pw $$$ monga also reveals that there was a practice of crediting the proceeds of the banker 's cheques into the account of party in case of high -nerth customers like british airways harshad$$$ 's group and other and such category of customers was generally given by the concerned manager of the bank having regard to the deposits maintained by the customers or other business potentials. while convicting the accused the trial court has not been able to segregate the fact that even assuming that what was d by $$$ bank was irregular that does not necessarily mean that it was d by the appellant. n of the witnesses of the bank have been able to clearly point out as to where the appellant was posted during the relevant period not his initials are identified and nothing has been brought on record that he credited the said cheques in the account of a- or he was concerned with the credit of the said amount in favour of a-. in the absence of any such evidence the charge under section 0b and substantive offences under section are not proved. it is apparent from the testimony of i.o. that no effort was made to collect any material which would have shown where the appellant was posted during the relevant period nor any record like the duty register was seized by the i.o. he admits that in matters of debit and credit various officers at different levels were involved. the prosecution has failed to produce any evidence oral or documentary which would go to show that the appellant had anything to do with the credit of the proceedings of the pay order into the account of a-. hence from the evidence as it stands it can not be stated that was in -charge of the clearing department and responsible for giving such credit in favour of a-. in view of the aforesaid state of evidence the conviction of for any offence including for the substantive offences under section ipc can not be sustained.case against . the case of prosecution against a- is that he abused his position as public servant by allowing use of mul 's funds to be wrongly obtained by a- and therefore he is guilty of the offence under section / w of pc act.he fabricated a set of letters written on the letter head of uco bank representing fraudulently that uco bank was entering into a transaction with mul. he also created a set of $$$s signed by him purporting to be an accountant although he was an assistant manager.his fraudulent misrepresentations of showing a transaction of purchase / sale of securities between uco bank and mul were to enable a- a- and a- to misappropriate the funds of mul. therefore apart from the charge of conspiracy against a- he is also charged with the offence under $$$ and of ipc.he forged the $$$s purporting to be the representation that a set of securities was being held by uco bank on behalf of mul and the same had been sold by uco bank to mul and thereby committed an offence under section ipc.he forged the letters and he dishstly made and/or signed the documents with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was signed under the authority of uco bank. he is therefore guilty of offence under section read with section ipc.having forged the documents as aforesaid he used these documents and therefore he is guilty of the offence as charged under section andg that the documents created by a- were intended to misrepresent the position of uco bank is also clear from the fact that the identification which should have been put on the document were it a transaction for and on behalf of a client was not so placed on the document. this is the evidence of pw. the intention of a- to misrepresent to mul that there would be a transaction between mul and uco bank is clearly established. it is contended on behalf of the prosecution that from the evidence of the witnesses following stands proved that the documents were not prepared in the normal course of business but outside the office. pw.that the uco bank 's branch was not authorised to conclude deals pw. if there had to be a genuine transaction of sale of securities between the uco bank and mul then that deal would have to be concluded between the head office of the bank and mul.the bank as a corporate entity and a govt. company could not lend its name to a private broker to enable him to obtain funds from any other $$$ the identity of the private broker being kept secret. this would constitute a clear deceit upon a public sector company -since it was d not for any commercial purpose but to deceive the public sector undertaking into placing its funds with that bank. the question of the deal being on behalf of the broker legitimately and commercially did not arise.it is submitted that the evidence of the officers of the uco bank that the bank would act for the brokers is being misconstrued. the banker can on behalf of the broker undoubtedly undertake such activities as are common in commercial usage. however it is obvious that such an activity should not be illegal or to attain unlawful purposes i. to deceive another corporate entity. if mul had authorised placement of funds only with psus then it is obvious that it would not be in the interest of the uco bank to lend its name to a broker to obtain funds from a psu -since it would constitute a deceit upon the other psus.a- wrote letters which constituted a clear representation to mul that it was entering into a transaction with uco bank -it is apparent from the plain language of the letter. it is clear that a- would not be authorised to write such letters unless he had been permitted to do so by the head office. on this apparent tenor the letter would commit the uco bank personally to a transaction of sale / purchase of securities and a- was not authorised to do so. the letters written by a- therefore were purporting to be with an authority which he did not possess and purporting to commit the bank to an agreement thereby clearly being forgery. pw and pw also employees of uco bank have pointed out that only head office used to give instructions for deals on behalf of the bank.that the documents created by a- were intended to misrepresent the position of the uco bank is also clear from the fact that the identification which should have been put on the document that it was a transaction for and on behalf of a client was not so placed on the document -this is the evidence of pw. this intention of a- therefore to misrepresent to mul that there would be a transaction between mul and uco bank is clearly established. the prosecution has further charged a- with forgery for writing letters i. the letters dated.$$$.charge nos. and dated.$$$.charge nos. on the letter -head of uco bank hamam street branch to mul. further it was pointed out that a- could not have written the letters $$$. and on behalf of uco bank. mr. mahesh$$$ who appeared as amicus curiae for a- referred to the $$$ policy circular dated.and submitted that the said circular nowhere prohibits the bank even after.to act as broker on behalf of their clients. it only provides that banks can not issue bank receipts. prior to that there was no such prohibition and it only provided that such $$$s must be backed by units / securities. he referred to the letter dated.written by a- to mul $$$.and $$$.which is an agenda note for the meeting of the directors for investment of funds to be held on.and the resolution of the same date passed by the chairman and the managing director as well as director finance of mul. he submitted that in the letter dated.written by a- it is nowhere stated that mul was purchasing units from uco bank. with regard to crediting of funds in a- 's account it is submitted on behalf of a- that the evidence on record discloses that it was not a- who allowed mul funds to be wrongfully gained by a-. mul 's funds were credited into the account of a- allegedly by . the funds were already credited to a- 's account by $$$ bank new delhi from where the same were transferred under the instructions of pw to a- 's account in $$$ bank bombay uco bank received funds already credited to a- 's account in $$$ bank bombay. moreover when uco bank received those funds from $$$ bank bombay the same were received under credit advices specifically directing uco bank that the proceedings of the said cheques were for the credit of a- 's current account no. with uco bank. the credit advices for the cheques are $$$. to $$$. there was no illegality on the part of a- and further there is no evidence of any actual loss caused to anybody or of intention to cause loss to anybody. in the absence of any evidence of dishst intent the charge under the pc act must fail. it is submitted on behalf of a- that charges of forgery have been framed on the assumption that $$$s. and are forged. the accused is convicted in ignorance of the fact that banks were entitled in law to act as agents for their customers and in uco bank this facility was offered to several brokers including a- as it was a lucrative source of income to the bank. for this reference is also made to the evidence of $$$ pw prem shanker $$$ and pw m.v. $$$ both employees of uco bank. it is further contended that pw karkhanis stated that the alleged letters could not be written by a-. this answer was clarified during cross -examination when he stated that as to why a- was not authorised to do so. he says that a- was not supposed to write such letters on behalf of uco bank as the hamam street branch could only transact business on behalf of brokers and could not transact business concerned with uco bank 's own investment. the fact of the matter however is that when a- addressed the letters he was not dealing with the bank 's investment but with the securities transactions of a-. there is no evidence that letters such as $$$.and could not be written by the hamam street branch of uco bank when it was dealing on behalf of its account holders is transactions in securities. on the contrary addressing such letters would be a necessary part of the function of acting as routing agents for their account holders inasmuch as it is part of the function of an agent of communicate receipt and delivery instructions to the counter party. $$$ counsel also high -lighted that resolutions passed by mul indicate transactions were for loan. he also submitted that in the alleged meeting in april / $$$$ if there was any such conspiracy then a- would not have acted as the broker for mul in the year. he submitted that in the year as per the record produced by the prosecution a- acted as broker of mul in other transactions. similarly he pointed out the resolution $$$.along with the agenda and submitted that investment of rs.crores in the units was through uco bank meaning thereby bank was not the seller of the units but the seller was somebody else on whose behalf uco bank was acting as broker. further the investment was only for days and expected yield was % per annum which normally no bank would pay. he further referred to $$$.which is a resolution as well as agenda of the meeting which was held on.to point out that mul was investing funds with $$$ bank as well as bank of america for getting higher yield. he referred to evidence of pw vol.page paragraphs and and pointed out that bank was agent was broker on behalf of its clients and for that it was getting commission and that commission was credited in the bank 's account by debiting the same in the account of its clients. for this purpose he referred to vol. page and relevant vouchers. lastly he submitted that a- is not at all connected with the transaction which took place without $$$s because at the relevant time he was transferred to another branch. for this purpose he referred to evidence of pw wherein it is stated that a- was transferred from.to.during which period last transaction took place. he submitted that for $$$s $$$.dated th march $$$.dated th march and $$$.dated th april a- has been errously charged for forging the $$$s on the assumption that uco bank did not hold the units for which the $$$s were issued. it is submitted that the charges proceeds on an incorrect assumption that the $$$s were issued on behalf of uco bank. b.rs. were issued on behalf of a- and the same were backed up by more than adequate units belonging to a-. the charge of forgery is accordingly misconceived and untenable. he submitted that after $$$ circular dated.it was irregular for banks to issue $$$s on behalf of their broker clients. prior to that date however it was the practice of uco bank and other banks to issue $$$s on behalf of their broker clients. it is submitted that the question which arises in the instant case is whether the $$$s issued by a- were backed up with units belonging to a- although charges have been framed on this aspect the cbi has undertaken no investigation whatsoever to discover whether the $$$s were backed up by securities belonging to a-. had the cbi undertaken this simple exercise this trial might never have seen the light of $$$$ and the accused would not have been harassed. it is further pointed out that in an almost identical case rc bsc)//bom.the cbi investigated the issue whether the $$$s issued by uco bank or a- were backed up by securities belonging to a-. on discovering after investigation that the $$$s were indeed backed up by securities the cbi filed a closure report $$$.a- -p.to vol.before the court and the said report was accepted on.. it is also submitted that in any event in the instant case there is clear precise and unrebutted evidence that each of the $$$s issued by uco bank and signed by a- was backed up by units belonging to a- in excess of the quantum of units for which $$$s were issued. not only are the charges pertaining to forgery of the $$$s factually misconceived as aforestated but the charge of forgery is based on a misconception of law. a document containing a false statement is not a forged document. it was next submitted that the argument of cbi that the letters were typed outside the office of uco bank does not mean that these are forged documents. the evidence of pw shows that in there was only typewriter in hamam street branch of uco bank which was being used since and there was heavy work in the office and that to

broker clients without safeguarding banks ' interest. you may be aware that with a view to helping the banks to overcome various deficiencies in the longterm securities market and to enable them to manage their short -term securities market and to enable them to manage their short -term cash deficit / surpluses more efficiently we have permitted banks to enter into buy -back deals in government securities among themselves and not with their non -bank clients. it was our expectation that such deals with be undertaken by the selling bank only if it holds sufficient securities either in the physical form or in sgl account at market related rates and such deals will be properly reflected in their books of account. however we observe that certain banks have been resorting to this type of transactions without actually holding sufficient securities either in physical form or in their sgl forms for want of sufficient balance at rates which have no relevance to market with a view to window -dressing their profitability / maintenance of slr requirement with the tacit understanding with the counter party banks. some of the banks appear to be taking outright oversold position in securities and in their desperate bid to cover the oversold position in a particular security ies enter into double ready forward deals and other banks oblige them in the matter. another disquieting feature observed is the extensive use of $$$s by banks. it has been out intention to ensure that the banks do not undertake sale transactions in securities without actually holding them and do not issue $$$s unless they are in a position to deliver the securities within a reasonable time. contrary to our above expectation banks have been issuing $$$s freely without regard to whether they will be in a position to deliver the securities there against within a reasonable time and against an initial outstanding $$$ a series of transaction are put through by further issue of $$$s and in the final analysis only the $$$s are exchanged and no security is delivered. some of the banks have also been issuing $$$s only behalf of their broker clients without verifying whether their broker clients hold the securities covered by the relative $$$s. it will be absolutely essential for your bank to frame and implement a suitable investment policy to frame and implement a suitable investment policy to ensure that operations in securities are conducted in accordance with sound and acceptable business practices. while evolving the policy you are requested to keep in view the following guidelines:(i under no circumstances the bank should hold a oversold position in any security that is to say that no sale transactions should be put through without actually holding the security in its investment account.all the transactions put through by bank either on outright basis or ready forward basis and whether through the mechanism of / sgl account or bank receipt should be reflected

follow the guidelines prescribed by them in this regard. subject to above the banks should issue $$$s covering their own sale transactions only and should not issue $$$s on behalf of their constituents including brokers.the banks should be circumspect while acting as agents of their broker clients for carrying out transactions in securities on behalf of brokers.vi any instance of return of sgl form from the public debt office of the reserve bank for want of sufficient balance in the account should be immediately brought to our notice with the details of the transactions. we shall

specifically requests the banks to evolve investment policy to ensure that operations in securities are conducted in accordance with sound and acceptable business practices by keeping in view the guidelines mentid in paragraph. prosecution has not produced on record policy evolved by the uco bank after this circular.the $$$ also specifically reveals that certain banks were engaged in type of transactions in securities which they should not be undertaking and list of such transactions inter alia includes the sale transactions by issue of $$$s without actually holding the securities and issuing of $$$s on behalf of their broker clients without safeguarding bank 's interest. $$$ the $$$ directed to frame and implement a suitable investment policy to ensure that operations is securities are conducted in accordance with sound and acceptable business practices. $$$ also requested that while evolving the policy the guidelines mentid in paragraph of the $$$ should be kept in mind and the bank should issue $$$s covering their own sale transactions only and should not issue $$$s on behalf of their constituents including brokers. the banks should be circumspect while acting as agents of their broker clients for carrying out transactions in securities on behalf of brokers.these guidelines would indicate that till the date of issue of guidelines banks were issuing $$$s on behalf of their broker clients. it was their investment policy. further the restriction which was suggested for framing the policy was that banks should be circumspect while acting as agents of their brokers client for carrying out transactions in securities on behalf of brokers. this would also indicate that there was no prohibition that bank should not act on behalf of their broker clients for carrying out transactions in securities. in any set of circumstances the aforesaid circular would reveal that till.many banks were adopting the practice of issuing $$$s on behalf of their broker clients and the transactions were undertaken in securities on behalf of their brokers. hence the $$$ clearly recognizes that some banks were indulging in such transactions. what was object by the said circular was that banks were issuing $$$s without verifying whether their broker clients were holding the security covered by the relative $$$s and thereafter the policy was suggested to all that $$$s should be issued covering their own sale transactions and they should not issue $$$s on behalf of their constituents including brokers. in this case the aforesaid transactions have taken place prior to.therefore assuming that uco bank has evolved such policy of not issuing $$$s on behalf of its brokers as directed by the $$$ then also it would not mean that by issuing $$$s prior to.he has committed any irregularity. as stated earlier there is nothing on record to suggest that $$$s were not backed by uti units. on the contrary defence has led evidence that $$$s were issued backed by units which we are not required to discuss.there is no other prohibition under any law or guidelines and the learned solicitor general was not in position to point out any other prohibition debarring the banks from issuing any $$$s particularly when the $$$s were backed by necessary securities.further it is for the prosecution to establish that $$$s were issued by a without being backed by uti units. admittedly there is no such evidence. on the contrary there is sufficient evidence on record that for the transaction mul gave lacs units for taking loan. as soon as amount was refunded on due date the said units were also received from mul by a-. for the remaining transactions admittedly $$$s were received and this is also stated in the reply given by mul to jpc. for the transaction as the $$$s were not received by mul transaction was over within days but there is no evidence that uco bank was not holding the units for the said transaction. from the evidence on record it can not be held that a- had issued $$$s without being backed by sufficient number of securities i. uti units. no witness from the bank has stated that a- was required to maintain the account for such transactions. on the contrary it has come on record that practice of maintaining register was dispensed wit because of increase of such work with the bank. $$$ from mul have specifically stated that looking at the $$$ it would be difficult to say that $$$s were issued without securities. $$$ admitted that looking at the $$$ of uco bank $$$.dated.no suspicion would arise on the face of it. $$$ has specifically stated that uco bank used to act as a routing bank and that such transactions were d through the broker 's account and were not treated as transactions of uco bank.the evidence on record clearly establishes that for the transaction a- can not be held responsible because at the relevant time he was transferred from hamam street branch. this has been specifically sated by $$$ in his deposition. he has stated that in $$$$ of april accused no. was transferred from hamam street branch to hingha branch near nagpur. in $$$$ of $$$$ he was again called back to hamam street branch but $$$$ a- was not in hamam street branch. he has also stated that he would not be able to say who transacted the transaction dated$$$$ $$$$ with mul. this also indicates faulty investigation. hence for the transaction $$$$ it has been brought on record by the prosecution that a- was not working at the uco bank hamam street branch. at the relevant time he was transferred to hingha branch near nagpur. further the resolution dated.passed by the mul clearly reveals that the funds were placed with uco bank for investment in units for $$$$ days w.f. $$$$ $$$$ at an expected yield of % p.a. the prosecution has failed to prove that a- paid the said amount to a-.the evidence of witnesses from the bank reveals that such transactions were the commercial practice of the bank-(i pw karkhanis has stated that uco bank hamam street branch was doing business on behalf of brokers including a- harshad s. $$$. he admitted that switch transactions were the transactions conducted by the uco bank for buying and selling the securities on behalf of its clients including brokers.the negotiations in respect of such transactions were conducted by the clients directly with the counter party. uco bank used to act as a routing bank in such transactions. the said transactions were d through the brokers accounts and were not treated as transactions of uco bank. the hamam street branch used to conduct its transactions on the instructions of the head office and under the instructions of its clients on their behalf. uco bank used to undertake such transactions on behalf of its clients on charging its commission and that the bank had made substantial profit by undertaking such transactions. as per mr. barve who was also of the managers there were such brokers. whenever switch transactions used to take place under the instructions of the brokers their instructions to receive or deliver securities were sent to the counter party along wit the cost memo and brs. the brs and cost memos used to be of uco bank. the brokers ' instructions used to be on the letter head of the broker. the purpose of sending brokers instructions along with various documents to the counter party was to put it on a proper notice. it is his further say that per day there used to be to switch transactions. during the internal audit and statutory audit of the relevant period there were no adverse comments over switch transaction.pw prem shanker $$$ has stated that as far as hamam street branch of their bank was concerned the said branch used to conduct the security transactions on behalf of their head office as well as on behalf of clients. mr. harshad s. $$$ was of such clients. in case of sale transactions on behalf of their clients they used to get written instructions from their clients having necessarily their accounts with the bank. the instructions being for the sale of the security they were ascertaining from their clients about the availability of the security with the bank or when he will deliver to the bank. on receipt of the security they were preparing a cost memo as per instructions of their client as contained in his instructions letter. without security in the hands of the bank they were not preparing the cost memo and sending it to the counter party. he admitted that hamam street branch of uco bank was not maintaining security account either security wise or otherwise of the clients. brs $$$s. and were issued in respect of security transaction put through on behalf of the head office or the client. the delivery order $$$.a-( contains instructions to uco bank which was received by a- harshad s. $$$ without the name of its branch.pw mr. $$$ has stated that harshad s. $$$ had his current account with their branch. he came across a person by name mr. $$$ working with harshad s. $$$ who sometimes used to come to hamam street branch in connection with brokers security transactions. no record in a form of security ledger or security register broker -wise was kept and maintained in respect of security transactions of their broker clients. initially there used to be such record but because of increase in the transactions in security on behalf of their broker clients in large numbers the practice of maintaining such record was discontinued. brs were issued by the uco bank hamam street branch and were signed by him in the caption of accountant after he found that the contents thereto were true. with regard to br dated.containing signatures on its reverse it is his say that signatures on reverse of br signifies reversal of the br meaning thereby that counter party had received the security and obligation of uco bank who had issued the br stood discharged.dw.a( mr. ramnathan stated that the bank would issued its br only against back up of another br i. the br issued by other banks in favour of uco bank stating therein that the said issuing bank held the securities in question with it. brs could be issued on bank 's own behalf as also on behalf of its customers. when uco bank would act for a customer while issuing its br. same position would exist as far as back up of the security except that it would debit or credit as the case may be in the customers account. no bank can issue its brs in the name of any party other than banks and financial institutions. for switch transaction it is pointed out that on the representation and discussion of brokers they were continued. in case of delay bank would charge interest at the market rate. bank was also having discretion to increase commission. letter dated.$$$.also informs the concerned officer at hamam street branch as under:--..you are advised to contact other banks through whom such transactions are routed and have detailed discussions with them regarding their experience the commission they charge the modus operandi and their opinion why other banks are not entering the field. you are also advised to contact other banks who are not having such transactions and have discussion with them with a view to find out why inspite of profitability in this area they are not entertaining this and give your report at an early date. for routing facility he explained that routing transaction is the transaction in which purchase and sale of the securities was d by the bank as an agent of its customer for a commission. the routing facility was offered to many brokers including a- in the year and such brokers availed of the said facility. such routing facility was already in practice even before he joined as divisional manager in june. some of the banks were offering such facilities.on the point of forgery-. $$$ passed by the mul reveal that mul was placing funds through uco bank in units. this phraseology used in the resolution does not reveal true colour of the transactions that mul was not purchasing and selling the units from uco bank nor uco bank was selling or purchasing the units from mul. it only meant that the transactions were through uco bank. $$$ or purchaser was a person. in this set of circumstances to say that a- prepared forged documents that uco bank was selling or purchasing the units is totally misconceived and is against the documentary record maintained by mul. letters $$$ts. and written by a- also do not reveal that uco bank was purchasing or selling units. the said letters are as under:--"$$$.maruti udyog ltd. $$$

selling units. it only mentions that for the purchase of units mentid in those letters the amount to be remitted through anz $$$ bank new delhi. evidence on record establishes beyond any doubt that a was authorized to deal on behalf of the broker clients and if the broker client had instructed that amount be sent through $$$ bank writing of such letter would not mean that he has committed any fraud. for the allegation of forgery it is to be stated that in the instant case a- has been charged with forging the brs $$$. dated th march $$$. dated th march and $$$. dated th april on the ground that uco bank did not hold the units for which the brs were issued. all the transactions are based upon the documents which stand proved by the evidence of various witnesses of mul who signed the documents. the transactions were through uco bank. further there is nothing on record to show that uco bank either purchased or sold the units of mul. the charges proceed on an incorrect assumption that the brs were issued on behalf of uco bank. the cbi has undertaken no investigation whatsoever to discover whether the brs were backed up by securities belonging to a-. further once it is held that the uco bank hamam street branch was entitled to deal on behalf of their clients then it would be difficult to hold that issuance of the said brs by a was in any way forgery punishable under the indian penal $$$. issue of brs on behalf of broker clients was part of commercial transactions. routing facility was given by the bank was proved prior to $$$ circular dated.. even $$$ circular does not prohibit issuance of brs if properly backed by the security. the evidence on record nowhere establishes that the bank was not holding adequate securities before issuance of brs. with regard to the alleged forged typing of letters outside the office of uco bank there is evidence of pw which shows that in there was only typewriter in hamam street branch of uco bank which was being used since and heavy work in the office and that to transactions of such work were $$$$ carried out. in the circumstances from the fact that document was typed out side the bank dishsty can not be attributed to the accused. for this purpose we would straightway refer to the decision rendered by this court in dr. $$$ v. delhi administration $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ wherein this court held thus:--"to summarize the expression defraud involves elements namely deceit and injury to the person deceived. $$$ is something other than economic loss that is deprivation of property whether movable or immovable or of my and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body mind reputation or such others. in short it is a non -economic or non -peculary loss. a benefit or advantage to the deceiver will almost always cause loss or detriment to the deceived. even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or advantage to the deceiver but no corresponding loss to the deceived the condition is satisfied. in that case dr. $$$ purchased a car in the name of her minor daughter nalini aged about months. the price of the car was paid by her. the transfer of the car was notified in the name of nalini to the motor registration authority. the insurance policy was transferred in the name of nalini after the proposal form was signed by dr. $$$. subsequently when the car met with the accident dr. vimla filed claim forms as nalini. she also signed the receipts acknowledging the compensation my as nalini. dr. vimla and her husband were prosecuted under $$$ and of indian penal $$$. the high court convicted dr. vimla under sections and of ipc. in that set of circumstances this court held thus:--..certainly dr. vimla was guilty of deceit for though her name was vimla she signed in all the relevant papers as nalini and made the insurance company believe that her name was nalini but the said deceit did not either secure to her advantage or cause any non -economic loss or injury to the insurance company. the charge does not disclose any such advantage or injury nor is there any evidence to prove the same. the fact that dr. vimla said that the owner of the car who sold it to her suggested that the taking of the sale of the car in the name of nalini would be useful for income -tax purposes is not of any relevance in the present case for reason the said owner did not say so in his evidence for the other it was not indicated in the charge or in the evidence. in the charge framed she was alleged to have defrauded the insurance company and the only evidence given was that if it was disclosed that nalini was a minor the insurance company might not have paid the my. but as we have pointed out earlier the entire transaction was that of dr. vimla and it was only put through in the name of her made minor daughter for reasons best known to herself. on the evidence as disclosed neither was she benefited nor the insurance company incurred loss in any sense of the term. for arriving at the said conclusion the court further referred to section and of ipc and held as under:--"the definition of false document is a part of the definition of forgery. both must be read together. if so read the ingredients of the offence of forgery relevant to the present enquiry are as follows fraudulently signing a document or a part of a document with an intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of a document was signed by another or under his authority making of such a document with an intention to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed. in the definitions both mens -rea described in section i.fraudulently and the intention to commit fraud in section have the same meaning. this redundancy has perhaps become necessary as the element of fraud is not the ingredient of other intentions mentid in section. the idea of deceit is a necessary ingredient of fraud but it does not exhaust it an additional element in implicit in the expression. the scope of that something more is the subject of may decisions. we shall consider that question at a later stage in the light of the decisions bearing on the subject. the thing to be noticed is that in section adverbs dishstly and fraudulently are used alternatively indicating thereby that excludes the other. that means they are not tautological and must be given different meanings. section of the penal $$$ defines dishstly thus whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to person or wrongful loss to another person is said to do that thing dishstly.$$$ is defined in section thus:"a person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud but not otherwise.the word defraud includes an element of deceit. $$$ is not an ingredient of the definition of the word dishstly while it is an important ingredient of the definition of the word fraudulently. the former involves a pecuniary or economic gain or loss while the latter by construction excludes that element. further the juxtaposition of the expressions dishstly and fraudulently used in the various sections of the $$$ indicates their close affinity and therefore the definition of may give colour to the other. to illustrate in the definition of dishstly wrongful gain or wrongful loss is necessary enough. so too if the expression fraudulently were to be held to involve the element of injury to the person or persons deceived it would be reasonable to assume that the injury should be something other than pecuniary or economic loss. though almost always an advantage to causes loss to another and vice versa it need not necessarily be so. should we hold that the concept of fraud would include not only deceit but also some injury to the person deceived it would be appropriate to hold by analogy drawn from the definition of dishstly that to satisfy the definition of fraudulently it would be enough if there was a non -economic advantage to the deceiver or a non -economic loss to the deceived. both need not co -exist. hence it would be difficult to infer that a- did anything dishstly fraudulently or to defraud.j for handing over lac units it is to be made clear that uco bank has not purchased that said units or sold them to mul. as the said units were sold by the broker clients to a- through uco bank the units were required to be returned to a- and that would be clear from $$$hibit. this function is considered by the $$$ as routing function as explained by the witnesses of the bank which we have referred to earlier.the commission for the transactions on behalf of a- was credited in the bank account by debiting the same in the account of a-. if really a- was acting on his own behalf and not on behalf of bank the commission amount would not have been reflected in the bank 's account. finally of the important circumstance required to be taken into consideration is crediting of brokerage charges / commission for the said transactions by the uco bank. if a- was having any guilty mind or dishst intention which is essential for convicting him for the offence punishable under section or other sections of ipc he would not have seen that the brokerage charges / commission is credited in the account of the uco bank.no objections were raised during the internal audit or statutory audit. pw $$$ states that in case of sale transactions on behalf of their clients after obtaining written instructions and about the availability of security with the bank they were preparing cost memo and sending it to the counter party. this would also indicate that brs would not be issued without verifying availability of security with the bank. from the aforesaid discussion it is required to be held that the prosecution has miserably failed to establish that a- had issued brs without being backed by the sufficient security namely uti units for the transaction uti units were belonging to a- which mul had given as security for the loan amount received by it and therefore a- was entitled to get it back before issuance of the guidelines by the $$$ $$$ had itself noted that many banks were issuing brs on behalf of their brokers there was no prohibition to the banks with regard to the issuance of the brs on the behalf of their clients. only thing which was required to be verified was whether there was sufficient security. the witnesses on behalf of bank have admitted that uco bank and other banks were giving routing facility to their clients and that routing transaction was a transaction in which purchase and sale of securities was d by the bank as an agent of its customer for a commission resolutions by the mul also reveal that the investment for the transactions was through uco bank and for the transaction the investment was with uco bank it was uco bank 's investment policy to have such transactions. hence it can not be stated that a- was having any dishst intention there is no allegation that a- gained by such transactions and there is no loss to the bank or to the mul. no inference of dishsty or intention to defraud could reasonably be drawn. in this set of circumstances it would be difficult to hold that a- committed any offence and a- requires to be given benefit of doubt.case against a-. before dealing with the case against a- it is to be stated that allegations against him are serious. as per the parliamentary committee report there were manipulations by some $$$ in favour of such brokers. parliamentary committee has also noticed that scrutiny of security transactions in number of banks reveals that some banks were even handing over account payee cheques drawn in favour of other banks to the brokers who got them credited to their account ostensibly to assist the broker in transferring funds quickly to meet their obligations. many brokers including harshad s. $$$ a- were getting routing facilities. thus banks provided special privilege to select few brokers by lending their names to the transactions of these brokers totally disproportionate to the income derived and exposed themselves to great risk by irregularity issuing their brs. the committee also noted that a- was also unauthorisedly given the facility of collection and credit of the banker 's cheque by sbi as per his instructions. the bombay main branch of sbi acting as the agent of sbi caps had debited sbi caps account and unauthorisedly credited funds to the account of a- instead of making payments to named banks. the cheques drawn on uco bank had been credited to the account of the same broker. for this purpose the brokers wanted the facility of single point clearance whereby the activities of issuance and acceptance of bankers ' cheques in their accounts may be conducted through the security division of the sbi 's main branch bombay. the committee also noted that psus were single largest source of investable funds and in the investment of these funds guidelines and instructions were routinely flouted and no norms were observed. it is true that certain unauthorised facilities were given in banking transactions to a-. however for convicting a- it should be proved beyond reasonable doubt that he had committed certain offences punishable under the act. it is true that it any illegal practice or usage is developed by banks or psus it would not be a good defence because illegality committed by a corporation or the concerned officer is required to be dealt with and punished if it is an offence in accordance with law. take for illustration collecting donation of unaccounted my even if it is practice or usage it would be an offence. this is sought to be brought out on record in the cross -examination of i.o. bhatnagar that pw $$$ has given a statement before him that a- gave a vip suitcase containing cash to $$$. further we are required to decide the case on the touchst of ingredients of the offence punishable under ipc and there can not be any doubt that those who are found guilty should be punished but the conviction must be on the basis of established criminal jurisprudence and not on moral or equitable ground or impression created or gathered by the prosecuting agency. it is also true that in the present case dealing in public funds was to a large extent but that would not itself be a sufficiently ground for drawing any inference in favour of the prosecution particularly when there is no evidence on record that mul or uco bank suffered any loss or any of accused nos. to gained anything. on the contrary there is evidence on record that uco bank got commission from the said transactions. this court in state delhi admn.v. $$$. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ observed as under:-"mankind has shifted from the state of nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer the physical power of a litigating individual or the might of the ruler nor even the opinion of the majority that takes away the liberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him suffer a sentence of imprisonment. award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties accusations are brought against the accused the prosecutor is given an opportunity of supporting the charge and the accused is equally given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence. it is the outcome of cool deliberations and the screening of the material by the informed mind of the judge that leads to determination of the lis. if the cushion is lost and the court room is allowed to vibrate with the heat generated outside it the adjudicatory process suffers and the search for truth is stifled. $$$ the aforesaid principle in mind i would deal with the prosecution case against a-. transactions took place between the mul and a- $$$$.and beginning of $$$$. a- says that the lent my to mul and mul returned the loan on due date together with agreed interest. this loan was a secured loan inasmuch as mul transferred and delivered lacs units of the uti. the case of the prosecution is that there is an irresistible inference that a- was involved throughout in the case because:--(a the pay orders of $$$ were collected by his agent mr. anuj $$$ the pay orders were deposited as if he was the payee which is clear from the apparent tenor of the pay in slip;(c there are letters written by his agents / employees to anz $$$ bank asking them to credit the proceeds of the pay orders to his account;(d receipt had been given by his office in respect of the transaction of lacs units which receipt found its way to the records of the mul. in the face of this evidence the defence of a and a that they had no knowledge of the involvement of a- is patently untenable.in any event the entire beneficiary of the whole transaction was a- to whom monies became available for use. from the evidence on record it is proved that-. undisputedly there is no statutory prohibition that mul or uco bank can not grant loan to the individual. in the present case admittedly there is no loss to the mul or to the uco bank. it is not the prosecution version that accused nos. or got any advantage or gain because of the transactions. in any case there is no evidence. in transaction mul took loan by handling over lacs units of uti. in other transactions mul gave the amount on the basis of bank receipts. bank receipts were backed by the units. rbi directions which are issued in july nowhere prescribe that a transaction by the bank on behalf of the broker clients if it is backed by the adequate securities is irregular or prohibited. on behalf of mul it has been stated before the jpc that the transactions were regular and there was no irregularity. no officer of the mul has stated before the court tat transactions were irregular. witnesses examined on behalf of mul are pw bhargava who was a legal advisor mul and company secretary pw. agharam halasyam who was the general manager finance with $$$ who was working as $$$ecutive. all have stated that transactions were on the basis of resolutions passed by the sub -committee which were approved by the board. if mul board decides to enter into such transactions officers like a and a or a can not be held guilty. no bank officer has stated that the transactions were illegal or there was any irregularity. uco bank has received commission for the said transactions. in such circumstances there is no question of misappropriation of the amount by taking loan. in any case alleged gain to a- was of taking loan for a very short period which is repaid on agreed date with agreed interest. the loan was taken by pledging uti units. at the most in the fir it is stated that the amount was given to a at a lower rate of interest and that in the transaction he charged more interest. this contention is also without any substance because in transaction a- only charged.% interest for the amount. as against that in all subsequent transactions rate of interest given to the mul was.% %.% and % respectively. presuming what is stated in fir is true that lower rate of interest was charged then also once it is loan transaction to a- there is no question of misappropriation of the amount of a-. the next question is -whether the bank receipts were backed by units or not for that purpose prosecution has not led any evidence. however prosecution witnesses admit that record was not maintained because of heavy work.for the purpose it would be difficult to hold that a- is responsible or liable.even for a- there is no evidence to the effect that a- was required to maintain such accounts.witness dw( $$$ examined on behalf of a states that units were handed over to the bank. for the aforesaid transactions also bank has received brokerage charges which is reflected in the bank accounts. neither the auditors of the bank nor the higher officers have raised any objection to such receipts. on the contrary as per the jpc report as well as rbi guidelines banks were indulging in such transactions. as deposed by the witnesses these transactions were regular and routine transactions. it is contended that in reality if it were loan transactions then there was no question of giving a facade of sale transactions and it establishes fraud. this submission can not be accepted because of the resolutions of the mul fixing days for repayment and the rate of interest meaning thereby if the amount is not returned on $$$$ the units would stand forfeited and for that limited purpose it is a sale transaction and if the amount is repaid with interest units would be returned. further in case of sale or purchase of units there would not be any question of payment of interest. question of payment of interest would arise in cases of loan transaction. as discussed above resolutions passed by the mul maker clear distinction of investing the amount with the bank or through the bank. $$$$ be that there was facit understanding as the loan can not be given to a- by mul it should be routed through a bank. for this transaction uti units were handed over to the bank therefore there is no question of any fraud or mis -appropriation. in any case for this purpose a- is not liable. the resolutions were passed by the mul that the amount be given to uco bank for purchase / sale of units. whenever the transactions were directed with the bank the resolutions mentid with the bank and in other places it mentid through the banks. this would indicate that the chairman -cum -managing director and director finance of mul were having full knowledge that the transactions were loan transactions in favour of persons other than the uco bank. therefore only question is whether such transactions through the bank could be held to be an offence either under section or section of ipc. relevant sections are as under:-". dishst misappropriation of property. dishstly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable property shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to years or with fine or with both. criminal breach of trust. --whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishstly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property or dishstly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express of implied which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or wilfully suffers any other person so to do commits criminal breach of trust. sections and require dishst misappropriation. the word dishstly is defined under section ipc as under--". dishstly. does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to or wrongful loss to another person is said to do that thing dishstly. what is punishable under section is dishst misappropriation or conversion to his own use any moveable property. further as per the $$$planation dishst misappropriation for time being or for a short time is also misappropriation within the meaning of the section. hence for establishing the offence it is required to be proved . the property belongs to a person other than the accused. the accused appropriated the said property or converted it to his own use. and,. he did so dishstly'--that is to say with the intention of causing wrongful gain to or wrongful loss to another person. allegation in this case are that accused appropriated cheques issued by $$$ in favour of $$$ bank to himself. secondly that appropriation was misappropriation and ly it was dishst. further essential ingredients required to be proved under section are--. accused must be entrusted with some property or with any dominion over property. he dishstly misappropriates or dishstly converts to his own use that property or. dishstly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract or. willfully suffers any other person to do so. in this case an essential ingredient which is required to be established would be dishst misappropriation or use. for this it is contended that a- took loan from mul through uco bank. if it is established that he took loan from mul through uco bank then there is no question of misappropriation because property belonged to him as he was the owner of the said amount. for this purpose let us consider the prosecution case in the light of the following illustrations presume that a- received the amount by investment / loan from uco bank by depositing uti unites orb presume that a- took loan from mul directly by pledging uti units. in both the aforesaid cases it can not be held that the said transactions are illegal or irregular.then c there is a resolution by mul that investment / loan can not be made by mul with any individual. admittedly there is no such statutory provision or rules prohibiting such investment. resolution permits investment with banks / psus.in such case presume that a- approaches bank to act on his behalf for getting investment from mul by depositing units. bank writes letter for such investment issues bank receipt receives my pays it to a- as agreed by charging brokerage which is considered to be a commercial transaction by a bank. the question to be asked would be whether any such transaction through bank would be an offence?. $$$ facie there is no such law prohibiting such transaction nor it can be held to be an offence under any law. in such a transaction there is no question of dishst misappropriation. the investigating officer pw mr. bhatnagar in his cross -examination has stated that according to him after the placement of funds with uco bank the bank would not be acting illegally if it places those very funds with a party. however the prosecution case is made out on the ground that as mul was not giving any loan directly to individual a- he manipulated and created subterfuge as if uco bank was purchasing the uti units. for this purpose on behalf of mul cheques were issued by $$$ in favour of anz $$$ bank. those cheques were deposited at delhi branch and the amount was transferred in the name of a- at $$$ bank 's bombay branch. $$$ $$$ bank 's bombay branch issued cheques in favour of uco bank and in turn uco bank gave credit of the said amount to a-. further it is contended that if the transactions were with uco bank question is why the cheques were prepared in the name of anz $$$ bank there was no necessity of doing so.the said cheques were handed over to the representative of a-?. prosecution contends that as it was subterfuge this irregular method was adopted. defence contends that it was known to mul that amount was meant for a- and therefore this procedure was adopted for earliest release of funds in favour of a-. by this method. uco bank bombay branch got the my on $$$$. it is pointed out that $$$ bank was not at all concerned with my except for transmitting the same to its beneficiary. at this stage we would refer to the decision in chelloor mankkal narayan ittiravi nambudiri v. state of travancore cochin $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ airsc. in that case the appellant -accused was appointed receiver of a cotton $$$. he demanded and received payment over and above the market price in respect of cotton bales allotted to a shopkeeper. he was charged for criminal breach of trust and misappropriating the extra my received by him without bringing it into the $$$ 's account. the court dealt with the question whether the extra my was given by the shopkeeper to the accused for and on behalf of the $$$ or was given to him personally as a motive or reward for showing some favour. in that context court considered the definition of criminal breach of trust and held in para as under:--"it follows almost axiomatically from this definition that the ownership or beneficial interest in the property in respect of which criminal breach of trust is alleged to have been committed must be in some person other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person or in some way for his benefit. in the case before us it is not disputed that if the sum of rs. was paid by pw to the appellant by way of illegal gratification to induce the latter to make an allotment of cloth in his favour there could be no question of entrustment in such payment. the payee would then receive the my on his own behalf and not on behalf of or in trust for anybody else. the criminality of an act of this character would consist in illegal receipt of the my and the question of subsequent misappropriation or conversion of the same would not arise at all. learned solicitor general mr. $$$ contended that mul had not decided at any point of time to lend my to a-. the so -called transactions of lending my to a- or purchasing uti units from uco bank was mere pretence by giving a cover of ostensible sale of units to mul. if really there was a loan transaction between mul and a-. mul would have issued pay order in favour of a- but in the present case the pay orders bankers cheques were issued by the $$$ in favour of $$$ bank and the cheques were having endorsement of crossed cheques account payee non -transferable. after receipt of the said cheques surprisingly officer of $$$ bank credited it in the account of a-. $$$ a- again transferred it in his account in $$$ bank at bombay. he again issued the cheque through $$$ bank in favour of uco bank and uco bank transferred the said amount in favour of a-. he submits that if it was a real and genuine transaction of my lending by mul in favour of a- parties would not have credited such subterfuge or pretence as if mul was purchasing units from uco bank bombay office. it is his further contention that in any case a devasthali had no authority to sell units to mul. he pointed out relevant sections of the negotiable instruments act for contending that the amount of crossed a / c payee cheque having endorsement non transferable can not be paid to a-. for this purpose he referred to various provisions of negotiable instruments act chapter vi sections. learned senior counsel mr. $$$ made it abundantly clear that he confines his submissions to the effect that a- had only loan transactions with mul and the amount taken on loan was paid with interest and commission was paid to uco bank. the transactions are already squared up hence there is no question of any offence being committed by a-. he further makes it clear that considering the course of dealing it is apparent that there is consensus agreement $$$$ from mul were received for customer namely a- from the customers lender for handing over the same to the customer. equally when customer discharges the debt my would be paid accordingly to the lender. he therefore submits that this was a tacit agreement between the parties. in this case it is true that mul has passed the resolution to invest its funds with the psus or $$$ or through psus or banks. the words through would certainly mean that it is not with the banks. in any case because of the resolutions passed by the mul it can not be held that there was any prohibition for the mul to invest its funds through the banks by giving loan to an individual. if bank intervenes as the broker taking its responsibility on behalf of its client then it can not be said that the transactions are illegal or fraudulent. for this purpose in earlier paragraphs resolutions passed by the mul are referred. resolutions dated.$$$.specifically provides that to fetch higher rate of interest than what is available on loaning of funds of psus the board has permitted the sub -committee formed by it for the purpose to invest surplus funds of the company from time to time in the purchase of units of uti either through scheduled banks or directly. in any case the managing director and director finance of mul who had passed the resolutions for the transactions in question would have revealed the true nature of the transactions. they would have stated that they were or were not aware that loan amount was for a-. it is admitted that they were examined by the investigating officer mr. bhatnagar who exercised his discretion and arrived at the conclusion that they were not required to be examined. in criminal prosecution in such a situation if any reasonable doubt arises benefit would be in favour of accused. further adverse inference could have been drawn against a- if the amount was received by him without pledging any units with the bank. as discussed above it is the contention on behalf of a- that uti units were handed over to the bank and on that basis brs were issued by a-. for this purpose witness is also examined. however prosecution has failed to establish that brs were issued without being backed by the units. for the transfer of the amount from $$$ to uco bank at bombay branch via $$$ bank it has come on record that such irregular unjustifiable practice had developed with certain banks. it has also come on record that even sbi had given such facility to a- as per jpc report. in such a state of prosecution evidence it can not be held beyond reasonable doubt that a- committed any offence punishable under section or abetted offence punishable under section of ipc or has abetted any commission of offence punishable under sections r / w section ipc. for the cheque issued by the $$$ in favour of $$$ bank there is nothing on record that monies were meant for $$$ bank. as pointed out by the learned counsel for a- the beneficial interest for the said amount remained in a-. it is nobody 's case that the uco bank itself has sold or purchased the units and was entitled to have the cheque amount that is to say that ownership or beneficial interest in the property was not with uco bank. with regard to transaction it is to be stated that it is nobody 's case that uco bank sold and thereafter re -purchased the units to mul and therefore it was entitled to get it back from mul. as soon as the amount was re -paid by mul original owner of the uti units was entitled to get it back and that was d by a-. further document $$$.vol.page and $$$. a-( vol.page are referred to show that mul was knowing about the transactions with a-. ex.is the letter dated nd january written by uco bank to mul requesting to hand over the delivery of units to mr. khandelwal and ex.a.is the receipt dated.issued by mr. khandelwal an employee of a- on the letter -pad of a-. both these documents would also indicate that mul was fully aware about the transaction with a-. finally an important contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellants that for the transaction nos. to i. transactions dated..and.the special court would have no jurisdiction as the prosecution has failed to prove the conspiracy. admittedly the said transactions had taken place prior to cut -off date prescribed under section of the scam act which is $$$. in my view the said submission requires to be accepted. however it is not required to be discussed further in view of the finding that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused have committed any offence. finally there is no loss to mul or to the bank but as the loan amount is given to a- by mul through uco bank and as the loan is re -paid by a- it can not be held that a- committed the offence of mis -appropriation. further while deciding criminal matters where heat is generated outside the court room it is the function of the court to decide the matter after cool deliberation on the basis of existing law and criminal jurisprudence and the adjudicatory process should remain unaffected by such heat. conviction or acquittal in a system wedded to rule of law should be in accordance with law only. as observed in the case of $$$ supra if the cushion is lost and the court room is allowed to vibrate with the heat generated outside it the adjudicatory process suffers and the search for truth is stifled. it is for the parliament to enact laws to meet while -coloured illegalities or irregularities affecting the society. what emerges from the discussion of the entire evidence which to some extent is reproduced in the earlier paragraphs is:-(a the scam act does not create any new offence nor changes the procedure as prescribed in the code of criminal procedure nor raises any presumption pertaining to an offence punishable under the indian penal code or prevention of corruption act. the offences of mis -appropriation criminal breach of trust or fraud and forgery are required to be established by the prosecution on the basis of existing criminal jurisprudence which requires that prosecution has to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt. serious allegations would not be a ground for convicting the accused unless there is sufficient evidence to connect the accused with the crime.joint parliamentary committee found that many brokers used some of the banks as routing banks which carried large volume of securities transactions for them. the bombay main branch of sbi acting as the agent of sbi caps had debited sbi caps account and unauthorisedly credited funds to the account of hsm instead of making payments to named banks / institutions.the committee noted that the psus were the single largest source of surplus investible funds around rs. crores between april and december. in the investment of these funds guidelines and instructions were routinely flouted and no norms were observed. neither $$$ nor the ministries concerned took any steps to ensure the compliance of their guidelines. even the ministry of petroleum and natural gas which had made a review of investment of surplus funds by the psus under its administrative control in $$$$ closed its eyes knowing fully well that psus were investing with the foreign banks despite the guidelines of dpe that psus could have normal banking transactions only with nationalised banks.the psus have placed funds with banks and finance companies for very short periods sometimes for $$$$ and even for day implying supply of funds for speculative purposes to earn higher return. these banks / finance companies issued brs for the amount received. the psus after the maturity of investment returned the brs and go their monies along with the yield which was agreed to at the time of placement of funds. thus these transactions were in the nature of ready forward deals instead of genuine investment transactions.the prosecution version of conspiracy as stated in the fir and the chargesheet is contrary to what has been tried to be proved by leading the evidence of witness namely mr. khandelwal pw. in the fir and the chargesheet it is stated that there was conspiracy in the month of january. as against this evidence which is led is to the effect that conspiracy was hatched in april / $$$$. that evidence is found to be totally unreliable. subsequently developed prosecution version of conspiracy on the basis of evidence of pw creates doubt with regard to the efficacy of the investigation.there are no circumstances on record from which reasonable inference of conspiracy could be drawn as it was the practice adopted by some of the banks and public sector undertakings of short term investments of their extra funds. $$$$ be that the practice adopted by the banks or psus was unjustified or irregular.jurisdiction of the court under the scam act is limited for the transactions in securities after the day of april and on or before th june. as the prosecution has failed to prove the conspiracy the accused can not be convicted by the court for the transactions dated..and..remaining and transactions are on.and.for days and days respectively. before the transaction a was transferred from the hamam street branch.in the investment policy or lending policy as per the guidelines framed by the mul in ex.use of phrase through scheduled banks ' or directly appears to be intentional. through scheduled bank would indicate that the amount is not invested with the bank. $$$. and passed by the mul for investment of funds as reproduced above also reflect the same thing namely through bank or with the bank.resolution ex.dated.reveals how the documents were prepared to suit its purpose by the mul. the relevant part of resolution reads thus--..in our documents we have to show the borrowing as sales of our investments. therefore it is proposed to show such borrowing as reduction in our investments. this has been discussed with company secretary also who is agreeable for such treatment.pw$$$$ mr. rajan ramgopal has admitted that the name of the broker did not figure or reflect on the record of mul in the event of transaction of investment being through broker.in any case a and a who are sought to be prosecuted are not responsible for the said policy. the policy is framed by the board and as per the said policy sub -committee headed by the chairman and the managing director of mul and financial director has passed appropriate resolutions. it appears that they were in know of entire investments but for the reasons best known to the prosecution they are not prosecuted or examined as witnesses even though they were interrogated by the investigating officer.a and a were promoted for their efficiency and good work. the same stand was taken by the mul before the jpc despite knowing that there was so -called investigation by the cbi.mul has not suffered any loss. on the contrary it has received substantial interest for short term investment for $$$$.uco bank has also earned commission which is reflected in its account.k if there was any dishst intention on the part of a- he would not have credited the earned commission for the transactions in the account books of the bank.no loss to the uco bank.m neither the mul nor uco bank has lodged any fir for so -called mis -appropriation or fraud.the prosecution has not even suggested that accused nos. or got any pecuniary advantage or gain by such transactions.o evidence led by the prosecution discloses that it was the practice of the bank to issue brs for such type of transactions.it was the duty of the prosecution to carry out necessary investigation whether the brs were backed by the units or not. if the investigating officer fails to discharge its duty no inference can be drawn that brs were not backed by security / units. prosecution has miserably failed to prove that a- issued brs without holding units as security or that brs were not backed by units.$$$ chief general manager finance of mul has stated that looking at the brs of uco bank no suspicion would arise and that issuance of the brs necessarily indicates that bank issuing it would be holding the security covered under the br.mr. $$$ divisional manager of uco bank at bombay office at the relevant time has produced on record letter dated.ex.written by him stating resumption of switch transaction after discussing the subject with various authorities including zonal manager general manager and dy. manager of uco bank.on the evidence as it is at the highest it was a failure on the part of a a and a to perform their duties or observe rules of procedure in appropriate manner and may at the most be an administrative lapse.as discussed above there is no evidence against a- and a-$$$$ to connect them with the crime.a-$$$$ is prosecuted without collecting any evidence against him that he was responsible for crediting the amount in the account of a-. the prosecution has errously proceeded as if the amount of pay orders issued in favour of $$$ bank was directly deposited in the account of a-.for a- it is to be held that he gave loan to mul in transaction and borrowed the amount in last transactions. these transactions were carried out through uco bank. therefore assuming that those transactions were against the guidelines issued by the rbi it would not mean that a- has mis -appropriated the amount. he repaid the amount on fixed dates with stipulated interest. question of payment of interest would arise in cases of loan transaction and normally bank would not borrow the amount at such a high rate of interest. the bank has issued brs and there is no evidence that brs were not backed by the units. on the contrary defence has led evidence to suggest that units were given as security.for a- also investigating officer has not bothered to verify property because admittedly a- was transferred from hamam street branch at bombay to hingha branch near nagpur at the relevant time when transaction was carried out between.to..as mentid above section has tow parts. while in the part the person must dishstly or fraudulently induce the complainant to deliver any property in the part the person should intentionally induce the complainant to do or omit to do a thing. that is to say in the part inducement must be dishst or fraudulent. in the part the inducement should be intentional.in the present case it is very important to determine who is the controlling agent behind the act of the company mul. if the board of the mul or the management of the bank were fully aware of such transactions subordinates who carry out the transactions could not be held guilty as for the offences for which the accused are charged means rea must be proved. therefore those who are responsible for taking such decision could be prosecuted but not those who are only carrying out directions on the basis that it is a commercial policy of the company mul or the bank. as stated before jpc it was an effort to maximise the yield or surplus funds of mul and there was no need for the company to take any action against the officers.hence in my view prosecution has failed to prove its case against the accused. in the result criminal appeal no. of filed by ram narain poply a-$$$$ criminal appeal no. of filed by $$$ a- criminal appeal no. of filed by $$$ deosthali a- and criminal appeal no. filed by harshas s. $$$ a- are allowed and they are acquitted of the charges for which they were facing trial in this case.

appeal nos. of of and of filed by a pramod kumar $$$ a- $$$ deosthali and deceased a- harshad shantilal$$$ respectively are partly allowed. the order of conviction awarded by the special court in respect of a a and a is confirmed. however sentence of a and a is reduced to the period already underg.arijit pasayat j. notwithstanding my great respect for learned brother $$$ 's wisdom and erudition. i am unable to agree that some of the appellants i. a- a- and a- deserve to be acquitted. my reasons with which brother agrawal also agrees are as follows:0. the present appeals relate to special case no. which was of the cases filed by the central bureau of investigation in short the cbi under the provisions of special court trial of offences relating to transactions in securities act in short the special court act. before constitution of the court under the special court act several enquiries were made in relating to securities scam which allegedly broke out in may in various types of transactions relating to government securities. the basic allegation was that these transactions were made in active connivance with the officials of banks financial institutions and shareholders. committee known as$$$ committee was appointed by the reserve bank of india hereinafter referred to as the rbi under the chairmanship of shri r. $$$ the then deputy governor of the rbi. the committee submitted its report between may and april.  report in point of time was submitted by the committee in may and it was indicated that the amount involved was estimated to be about rupees crores. the government promulgated an $$$ which was replaced by the special court act on th august. when the matter was brought to the notice of both houses of parliament a joint parliamentary committee in short the jpc was appointed to enquire into the irregularities. prosecution version was that there were transactions conducted between january to may involving rs. purportedly as ready forward deals. the securities involved were units of unit trust of india in short uti. stages were involved in the transactions the sale and purchase and the reversal thereof. the bankers involved were united commercial bank hamam street branch bombay $$$ sansad marg new delhi bank of america bombay branch and new delhi branch anz $$$ bank sansad marg new delhi and anz $$$ bank bombay branch. the government company v. involved was maruti udyog ltd. in short mul. the report of the janakiraman 's committee and the jpc were placed before the trial court and were exhibited as and. the basic allegation was that as a result of criminal conspiracy surplus funds of mul had been deposited in $$$ new delhi and were diverted to the account of a- harshad with $$$ bank delhi and finally to uco bank bombay. it was the prosecutions 's case that there was no authority of accused -pramod and accused -ambuj jain to deal with a- harshad and though he was the full beneficiary and he had been directly benefited from the transaction a picture was presented as if he had nothing to do in the matter. such illegal transactions were d with the aid and assistance and direct involvement of a- deosthali and a-$$$$ $$$. accused nos. and were proceeded against on the basis that they were public servants with reference to section of the banking regulations act in short banking act. the accused -appellants were charged under sections of the indian penal code in short the ipc and section read with section of the prevention of corruption act in short the pc act. reference was made to various documents to show how the transactions were conducted and how documents were fabricated to facilitate use of the huge sums of my by a- harshad. all the accused persons pleaded innocence. the stand of accused no. pramod and accused no. ambuj jain was that they did not know the involvement of a- additionally. a- took a stand that a- harshad is broker of uco bank. so far as a- was concerned though he did not deny authorship of several letters which were placed on record by the prosecution to show alleged commission of forgery stated that the transactions were put through under mere routing facilities and in any event so far as the last transactions were concerned. he was not working in the concerned branch. he took a stand that though the letters produced by the prosecution to show that forgery had been committed as they were typed outside the office the same was d due to pressure of work. accused took the stand that he was totally unconcerned with the transaction. accused no. took a stand that there was no meeting as alleged by the prosecution to present a case of conspiracy and in any event he was totally unaware of the transactions and further even accepting that there were some transactions they were under mere routing facility. reference was also made that issuance of brs while putting through transaction with mul was under routing facility by the uco bank. they were illegally permissible and there was no prohibition for the same. there was adequate balance of securities my with uco bank at the relevant dates and uco bank sic its brs relating to the impugned transactions favouring mul. finally it was submitted that all the transactions were reversed and financial obligations were discharged and met and no amount was due or outstanding under the transactions in question. whatever had been d by and/or from the bombay office with regard to the impugned transactions was d under the instructions of khandelwal. the transactions in the securities between him and mul were conducted on principal to principal basis and the same were put through uco bank under routing facility extended to him by it and mul in particular was very much aware of the said fact namely that the transactions in question were directly between mul and him and that the same were on principal to principal basis. it was also pointed out that before the jpc there was no objection raised by the mul as no thing was considered irregular. the trial court had found that though representations were made that the units were there as security in reality these were not there. the findings in this regard are reproduced below:'all these would show that case as has been sought to put forthwith by accused no. s -hsm of there being sufficient balance of security namely. units in his account with uco bank to meet the commitments about transactions being nos. to with mul in the circumstances can not be believed and accepted and therefore requires to be rejected outright. each of the transactions needs to be examined separately. transaction no. this transaction dated.involves lacs units of uti as security and it is ostensibly shown to have been purchased by mul from uco bank hamam street branch bombay for a consideration of rs. there was a reversal as agreed on.. accused no. deosthali addressed a letter dated.on the letter head of uco bank of the concerned branch to mul stating that arrangement for payment of consideration of the aforesaid sum would be made through bank of america new delhi with a further request to mul to hand over the physical delivery of the security to $$$ pw. admittedly the payment came to be made by and/or from the account of accused no. harshad. bombay 's office of a- by its letter to bank of america bombay requested remittance of the amount by means of itro to its delhi branch for crediting into the account of mul delhi. accordingly bank of america bombay and delhi branches arranged the payment thereof to mul. on receipt of sic the securities were delivered to $$$ pw an employee of a- harshad at its delhi office who was instructed and deputed by khandelwal pw. the proposal submitted by a- indicated as if the transaction was between mul and uco bank hamam street bombay. nothing was mentid about the role of a- who was operating from behind the screen. at the reversal stage accused no. deosthali addressed a letter dated.exbt. on the letter head of uco bank to mul instructing it to remit the amount of rs. through $$$ bank delhi. letter was addressed by mul to its bankers $$$ delhi to issue a day order favouring $$$ bank. the same was handed over to $$$ pw. on instructions from khandelwal pw the pay order was deposited directly into the account of harshad a- with $$$ bank delhi by handing over the same to a-$$$$ $$$ the concerned officer of the $$$ bank. letter was issued by the delhi office of a- instructing $$$ bank for remittance of the amount by tt to its bombay branch which was d on $$$$. then the amount was paid by pay order to uco bank hamam street branch bombay and the amount was credited to the account of a-. a bare perusal of the method adopted shows that the same was disinvestments borrowing transaction between mul and uco bank though it was reflected to be a transaction as if mul had borrowed my from uco bank against the security as a ready forward deal the consideration was actually provided by harshad through the bank of america. in fact the interest that was paid by mul did not go to uco bank but went sic into the account of a- harshad exbt. is the letter dated.addressed by uco bank hamam street branch bombay to mul and it was signed at places by a- deosthali. there was no dispute that a- had signed and addressed the letter. exbt. is the letter dated.addressed by the bombay office of a- to the manager of bank of america bombay by which instruction was given to transfer the amount involved in new delhi in the account of mul. a- has taken a stand that the transaction was between him and mul on principal -to -principal basis through uco bank under routing facility. the agenda note and the resolution clearly show that mul was not dealing with a- on principal -to -principal basis in fact what was authorized was a transaction between mul and the uco bank. certain very suspicious circumstances surround this transaction particularly the role of a-. the letter exbt. was not typed in the office of the uco branch. the sic pw has categorically stated that he has not typed sic fact a- had admitted that it was typed outside and he has responsible for the typing d outside. his plea that due to pressure of work it had to be d outside can be accepted with a pinch of salt. it was for to say that there was pressure of work and therefore the letter was required to be typed outside. there was no other instance except the cases involving a- and the other transactions to which reference shall be made subsequently that the letter was typed outside. so far as reversal is concerned the role of a- is very significant. the letter exbt. was written by a-. he accepted that he was the author and signatory of the letter. exbt. no. is a letter dated.issued by the delhi office of a- to the $$$ bank by which it was instructed to credit the proceeds of the pay order exbt. to the account of a-. the same was authorized by $$$ pw and signed by $$$ pw. the current account number of a- was also mentid in the letter. from the statement of account of uco bank hamam street branch bombay exbt. it is clear that there was no debit entry showing that the uco bank bombay have charged any commission for the transaction of lakhs of units of uti and there is also nothing to show that uco bank had charged the commission from a-. from exhibits and which are internal vouchers it is clear that though names of bank of america and uco bank have been indicated there was no involvement of uco bank either in passing or receiving funds in its own account. on the contrary evidence shows that in the instance my was paid by a- though its bankers to mul. there was nothing to show that the payment was made to mul through bank of america under the instructions of uco bank bombay. similarly at the stage of reversal the amount paid by mul directly came to be credited in the account of a- in the $$$ bank delhi then $$$ bank bombay and finally in the uco bank bombay. in all these stages the amount went directly to the account of a-. there was no involvement of uco bank in financial aspects of the transaction if the bank as claimed by a- at all acted for him as routing bank in the transaction. on the contrary there is no involvement of uco bank either on.and.either in passing or receiving funds in its own account. at the instance my was paid by a- through bank of america to mul. there is nothing to show that such payment was made under the instructions of uco bank hamam street branch bombay.transaction no. coming to the transaction it involving lacs units of uti. here mul was the purchaser and uco bank hamam street branch bombay was the seller. the date of the transaction is.. here again the modus operandi for this transaction is almost identical to those involved in transactions and. in respect of the transaction a- addressed a letter dated.to mul on the letter head of the uco bank bombay instructing remittance of the amount involved. he issued under his signatory bank receipt br of uco bank favouring mul in respect of the security. the letter and the br were received at the instance in the office of a- at delhi which then passed across to a- who then put up a proposal in the form of agenda note before the investment committee showing as if the transaction was between mul and uco bank bombay and on this basis approval was obtained. on $$$$ as authorized signatory of mul a- instructed $$$ delhi to issue a pay order favouring $$$ bank by debiting the amount to the account of mul and accordingly $$$ issued its pay order for the amount directly to mul. a- 's delhi office instructed its bankers $$$ bank delhi for issuance of a banker 's cheque for the said amount favouring $$$ for the benefit of mul by depositing the amount into the account of a-. this is what was d. exbt. is the letter dated.which was signed by a- deosthali. by the said letter it was indicated to mul that it mul had purchased lakhs of units. there was a request to remit funds through grindlays bank. the agenda note and the approval clearly show that mul was to place funds through uco bank. a reading of the agenda note and the resolution clearly shows that the transaction was intended to be between mul and uco bank. much was made of the words through uco bank to contend that there was no prohibition on involvement of a-. this has to be considered in the background of the stand of a-. his stand was that the transaction was between him and mul on principal -to -principal basis. but the material on evidence clearly shows that the intention was that mul was to be the purchaser and the uco bank the seller. exbt. is the br issued by uco bank. the same was authored and signed by a-. br recites uco bank having received from mul the concerned sum being the cost of lakhs of units of the face value of rupees crores. it was stipulated that the security will be delivered when ready in exchange by this receipt is duly discharged. the said recital in the br clearly from its plain reading would indicate uco bank hamam street branch having undertaken to mul to deliver security namely lakhs units when ready in exchange for the said br. there is also endorsement made in the said br reading as discharged with a rubber stamp of mul which is proved to be made by accused no. pramod as proved by pw- mr. agraham ramkrishnan halasyam the officer of mul. this endorsement shows uco bank having discharged its sic to mul under the said br. credit advise dated.exbt. issued by uco bank is in the handwriting of a-. although in the narration of credit voucher it was mentid that lakhs of units related to mul there is no written record in that regard. exbt. which is the advise of grindlays bank does not justify the narration as appearing in the credit voucher. the material on record clearly justifies a conclusion that the amount involved came from the account of a- and was paid to mul. there was no involvement whatsoever of uco bank though the stand of mul is that the transaction was between it and uco bank. as is the case with the transaction. a- 's stand is that the transaction between him and mul was on principal -to -principal basis which routed through uco bank. but as noted above in the reversal stage uco bank does not figure at all. transaction. the situation is somewhat similar so far as transaction is concerned. the amount is question came in the instance from a- 's account with grindlays bank on the basis of instructions letter and approval from grindlays bank. bombay to grindlays bank delhi and from grindlays bank delhi to $$$ delhi in the account of mul. transaction. so far as transaction is concerned initially the proposal was for investment of units valued at rupees.crores through grindlays bank for $$$$ days but note / proposal was put up by a- which is very significant. there was approval for placement of rs.crores with grindlays bank of days at an expected yield of.% p.a. subsequently uco bank agreed to accept this fund at the same rate. there was some reluctance on the part of grindlays bank to accept the fund beginning.. accordingly the placement has been d with uco bank. reading of the note / proposal makes it clear the mul was dealing with uco bank and there was no question of sic with mul on principal -to -principal basis. in of sub -committee for the investment the committee had earlier approved the proposals as contained in the agency note. exbt. where the investment in the sic question was to be made with grindlays bank. but later on the same was changed and it was resolved to be made with uco bank hamam street branch bombay as proposed by a--pramod. significantly there was no written proposal either from uco bank or grindlays bank which has been received and placed before the committee of mul it had given its approval to the proposal for investment with uco bank. as noted earlier in respect of the other transaction there was no direct involvement of uco bank and it was a- creating a facade to give a picture to mul as if the transaction was between it and uco bank.transaction no. so far as transaction no. is concerned there was no letter issued by uco bank hamam street branch bombay and proposal to mul as was in the case of earlier transactions. the most significant aspect is that there was also no bank receipt br issued by uco bank hamam street branch bombay favouring mul in respect of the transaction. notwithstanding these the security was put through and mul parted with my which went into the account of a- in the same manner as in the case of transactions to. here again a- placed a agenda note exbt. which reads as follows:"we have received a request from uco bank for placement of rs.crores in units. the placement will be for $$$$ days with effect from.. the expected yield will be % per annum. the sub -committee 's approval was in the following terms:"resolved that maruti may place funds with uco bank for investment of units aggregating to rs. crores for a period of days w.f..at an expected yield of % per annum.another importance aspect is that the monies / funds were in fact credited eventually in the account of a- harshad with uco bank hamam street branch bombay. the debit and credit vouchers of the bank amply prove this. role of accused no. in the transactions are as follows:. carbon copy of bank voucher on the letterhead of mul approved and signed by a- exbt.. revenue entry on.carbon copy of bank voucher of mul approved and signed by a- exbt.. transaction no.  receipt dated.of uco bank hamam street branch. the expression discharged is in the handwriting of a-. the rubber stamp of mul and signature under the caption of authorized signatory is of a- exbt.. instruction letter of mul dated.addressed to manager $$$ delhi to pay order referring the anz grindlays bank signed by a- exbt.. transaction no. -agenda note for the meeting prepared by a-. exbt.. in the bank receipt of uco bank notings are made by a- exbt.. $$$ of the entry carbon copy of bank debit voucher accounts slips signed by a- exbt.. transaction no. -minutes signed by a- exbts. to. instruction letter dated.of mul addressed to the manager $$$ to issue pay order in favour of hong kong and shanghai banking corporation and in favour of grindlays banks signed by a- exbt.. for the transaction there was no br and it has not been explained by a- as to how the transaction could take place without br. a- concealed the receipt signed by on the letterhead of a- cancelling the receipt of lakhs of units from mul. it is therefore hard to believe that a- did not know that the ultimate beneficiary was a-. a- deliver pay order for the transaction to $$$$6. it has to be noted that for the time in this court a- has taken the stand that the relevant transactions were in the nature of loan between a- and mul. a- used to place the proposal before the board and obtained approvals for the investments in question. a decision was taken by mul for investing its funds with psu 's as deposed by $$$$. that clearly indicated that investments could only be in psu 's bonds. as per pw- mul did not engaged the services of brokers for its transactions and a- used to give instructions on the basis of which letters addressed to banks were prepared by mul clearly suggesting that the transactions were intended to be between mul and uco bank. therefore what was intended was that the transactions in securities were directly to be with uco bank. as per pw- it brought to the notice of a- that the pay order was being given to the grindlays bank in a transaction with uco bank. a- 's reply is very significant. the stand taken by a- that there was instruction by uco bank to issue pay order in favour of grindlays bank is clearly untenable because if the uco bank intended that in its transaction the pay orders were to be issued to grindlays bank the same could not have been without any direction from uco bank. the contention of a- is also not acceptable because in respect of and transaction pay orders continued to be issued to grindlays bank even though admittedly there was no instruction from uco bank. in the transaction he released funds of mul even in the absence of an authority letter or a security in form of bank receipt from uco bank. payments made at the stage of reversal by mul were directly made to a-. there was no authorization to purchase any securities from any brokers. there was no mention about the intention that monies will be given on loan to any broker. each transaction as reflected was considered to be a placement of funds with psus and there was no scope of any placement of surplus funds with private person. it is unbelievable that a- did not know about the involvement of a- when the receipt in respect of lakhs of units was kept in the record of mul. next comes the case of a-. in almost all the transactions the role of a- is very significant. investment of the transaction exbt. indicates that the same was written on the letterhead of uco bank and was signed by a- with reference to lakhs of units. so far as reverse entries are concerned letter dated.addressed by the uco bank rajabahadur building bombay to mul requested mul to remit funds through anz grindlays bank. exbt. transaction no. dated.is in the handwriting of a- and is signed by him. carbon copy of credit voucher of uco bank exbt. is in the handwriting of a- and also bears his signature. it indicates that the amount was intended for a- being the amount of security namely units sold to mul. similarly exbt. shows that a- signed on the debit voucher in the name of $$$ for rs.. in exbt. the signature of a- on the debit voucher of uco bank in the name of a- is there. exbt. is the signature of a- on debit voucher of uco bank in the name of $$$. transaction no. -letter dated.of uco bank is signed by a- exbt. br dated.is signed by a- exbt. exbt. is the signature of a- on the debit voucher of uco bank in the name of a-. exbt. page is the signature of a- in the name of a-. similar is the case of exbts. and where there are signature of a- on the debit vouchers of uco bank in the name of a-. transaction no. -br dated.covering security of lakhs of units signed by a-. credit voucher exbt. is in the name of a- signed by a-. similarly in the case of exbts. and. it is an accepted case that documents purporting to be prepared in the normal course were prepared outside the office. evidence of pw-6 is significant in this regard. significant factor as deposed by is that n of uco 's bank managers was authorized to deal with securities. if there was any genuine transaction for sale of security the deal could have been concluded by the head office of the bank. accused no. wrote letters and made a representation that he has entered into transactions for the bank. a- was not authorized to write a letter unless he is permitted to do from the head office. a- therefore did not have the authority to deal with the bank or to any arrangement. pws. and deposed that only the head office can instruct on behalf of the bank. a- 's signatures indicating various designations were fraudulent because it represented something which in reality was not there. a- has signed in various documents describing his designation differently. in letter dated.he has signed as manager. he has attested signature of khandelwal pw for uco bank. similar is the position in letters dated.ext..ext..ext. where he has signed as manager for uco bank. in exbt. dated.he signed as accountant. he issued the letters in question to mul and brs describing himself as manager on the letters and accountant on the brs though in reality he was the assistant manager. these are clearly conducts of deceit and dishst intention. on the basis of the letters and brs. mul parted with its funds which went to the account of a-. the letters and brs. were handed over to a-. the brs. which are in the format either cyclostyled or $$$ re -produced para of the trial court 's judgment show that there is a requirement for signatures at authorized signatories i. manager and accountant. in the case of concerned brs.a- has signed accountant in the space meant for manager. coming to the role of a- the key figure in the whole controversy several factors need to be noted. grindlays and uco bank never received my in their own right. they only collected the cheque for a- although the cheque in each case was non -negotiable payee cheque in favour of grindlays bank without any instructions from canara bank or mul. uco bank did not sell or agree to sell as a- had no authority either to sell or commit uco bank to any sale of security on behalf of the bank even if it is accepted that the bank had purchased the security it had become the property of bank and the securities dealt with as an agent is not to be reflected in the books of the bank yet such recording is appropriate. in the instant case the sale or repurchase has not been passed through the bank 's books. the stand that bank had received a commission is inconsistent with the stand that there was a sale and repurchase involved in the transaction. in such a transaction the difference in price is the profit and not a commission. for the transaction neither there was a letter from the uco bank nor a br which amply demonstrate that no security was delivered. though it is possible as an argument that in respect of transactions and certain securities were placed with a- by a- that really is of no assistance to a-. if any security is received the bank ought to have made some payment and if the bank has not paid to retain the security it would have been required to deliver the securities based on the br and/or its letters. in other words uco bank 's fund were payable to mul without having any legal right to retain any security which a- may have kept in his possession. another question which needs to be considered is whether uco bank received any consideration for the sale of mul. the banker 's cheque issued by canara bank on mul 's account was received by grindlay 's bank and credited to the account of a- and remitted to the bombay branch of grindlay 's bank. there was an instruction from grindlays bank to credit the amount in the account of a- in respect of banker 's cheques of uco bank. thus uco bank did not receive any my in the transaction. for the time before this court a- took a stand that there was a transaction between him and the uco bank. it is therefore clear that a- was the recipient of the my and he had derived benefit of it. certain important factual aspects need to be noted relating to the transaction and the role played by a-. pay orders of canara bank were collected by $$$ pw. these were deposited as though he was the payee. it is clear from the descriptions in the pay -in slips letters written by his agent / employees to grindlays bank giving clear instructions to remit the proceedings of pay orders to his account. receipts given by a- in respect of the transaction of lakhs of units were in the records of mul. it is clear from the resolutions and the minutes of discussion that mul had not approved the role or involvement of a- and it was not known to the board that the transactions were in reality with a-. the subterfuge adopted was to conceal actual state of affairs and to present a totally distorted picture. the stand of a- that mul 's counter party was uco bank who was acting for undisclosed principal is hard to believe. the evidence of pw- is to the effect so far as the transaction is concerned including question of brokerage he did not inform mul that the funds were received from the account of a-. pw did not indicate to mul that a- was the ultimate principal or beneficiary or that the funds were credited to the accounts of a- or funds were received from a-. it is most significant to note that there was no letter from the board on the transaction and even for the same transaction no brs were received. in all the transactions transfer of sum of my had been made as per the advice of account holder a-. exbt. is a letter dated.addressed to the manager. grindlays bank new delhi for remitting the sum of my to his account at m.g. road bombay. the agenda note prepared by accused no. did not make any mention of accused no. harshad but referred to uco bank. in fact a- has accepted that the transactions were between mul and uco bank and not with any individual. the letters written by a- are admittedly not typed in the bank 's office and significantly there was no outward reference number given on them as is the admitted usual practice. for the transaction there was only the br and no letter and for the transaction there was neither letter nor br. it is not disputed that there can be no oral transaction by banks. it must be reflected in the books of account. further a bank can not act as a broker under the banking act. it is not of the permitted acts. there is also not a question paying of any commission on purchase / sale of transactions. the transactions are therefore not transparent. the counter party i. mul does not appear to have noticed about the role of the brokers. the decisions in question did not refer to a-. harshad but to uco bank but the beneficiary is a-. the pay -in slips were filled up by pw-6 which indicate that he payment was made to a-. harshad and in fact there was no authorization from mul in this regard. the cheques were account payee cheques. in exhibit dated.. a- has signed as accountant. the document uses the expression cost. though the receipt was from a- it was indicated as if it was from mul. all the relevant vouchers show as if the sale of units was to grindlays ' bank. transactions show that payment was made to grindlays bank and not to uco bank and there was no question of mul issuing the cheque to grindlays bank. it would have been to uco bank. grindlays bank made the payment and uco bank had nothing to do with mul. the draft was in the name of uco bank. in essence uco bank has not received any my from mul. there was no direction given by grindlays bank. parliament street. all the vouchers that have been produced show that same are put through grindlays bank. the vouchers of mul clearly show as if the transaction was between mul and uco bank. much stress has been laid by the appellants on the role of khandelwal pw. the evidence on record clearly shows that khandelwal was not only known to mul but represented accused no. harshad and in particular to accused no. pramod. exbt. is the letter of the uco bank. hamam street branch bombay dated.addressed to the mul. $$$ mul had been instructed to deliver lakhs of units to khandelwal whose specimen signature was attested by accused no. deosthali. delivery of the said securities was effected to khandelwal pw by mul and the receipt was passed by pw. interestingly the acknowledgement is on the printed statiry i. letter head of a- harshad. in respect of each of the transactions to the pay orders issued by mul through its bankers canara bank towards the consideration of the security was handed over to pw under instructions of a- or a-. this amply establishes that khandelwal pw was not a total stranger or unknown to accused and as claimed. his association with accused. harshad also is clearly borne out. it is unbelievable that to a stranger i. pw khandelwal valuable securities of crores of rupees and pay orders were delivered by mul for which receipts were issued on the letter head of a- harshad. the evidence also shows that letters and the brs issued by the uco bank. hamam street branch. bombay in the transactions addressed to mul were s received in the office of a- and were then passed on to mul. in respect of the conspiracy in april / may it is of interest to note that in the meeting i.  may the board of directors of mul resolved and decided to deploy the surplus funds into the my market. the evidence of pw also throws some light on this aspect. the following portion of his evidence is of great $$$ accused no. at that time stated that mul could not deal or involve the brokers. mr. harshad s. $$$ stated that the deals would be between mul and banks structured and suggested by him i. harshad s. $$$. mr. $$$ would not appear in the books of accounts of mul and that is what he stated. though attempt was made to emphasize accused no. 's role in informing a- that mul could not deal or involve broker the statement attributed to a- harshad has also to be considered. an attempt was made to as if there was no broker involved. accounts were to be presented in such a manner that the role of a- would remain hidden. it is interesting as noted above that so far as the last transaction is concerned there is no letter or the br. though accused no. was the mastermind in reality. it reflects the involvement of several persons to present legitimacy while in reality that was not so. letters authored by a- made a clear representation to mul as if it was transacting with uco bank. it would be relevant to take note of the various offences alleged to have been committed under sections and of the indian penal code. the relevant provisions read as follows section criminal breach of trust by public servant or by banker merchant or agent -whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property in his capacity of a public servant or in the way of his business as a banker merchant factor broker attorney or agent commits criminal breach of trust in respect of that property shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to years and shall also be liable to fine.section cheating and dishstly inducing delivery of property

liable to fine.section forgery of valuable security. will etc.forges a document which purports to be a valuable security or a will or an authority to adopt a son or which purports to give authority to

purporting to be an acquittance or receipt acknowledging the payment of my or an acquittance or receipt for the delivery of any movable property or valuable security shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to years and shall also be liable to fine.section forgery for purpose of cheating -whoever commits forgery

reason to believe to be a forged document or electronic record shall be punished in the same manner as if he had forged such document or electronic record. it would be appropriate to deal with the question of conspiracy. section 0b of ipc is the provision which provides for punishment for criminal conspiracy. definition of criminal conspiracy given in section 0a reads as follows:"0a when or more persons agree to do. or cause to be d,--( an illegal act or( an act which is not illegal by illegal means such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy provided that no agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy unless some act besides the agreement is d by or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof. the elements of a criminal conspiracy have been stated to be an object to be accomplished a plan or scheme embodying means to accomplish that object an agreement or understanding between or more of the accused persons whereby they become definitely committed to co -operate for the accomplishment of the object by the means embodied in the agreement or by any effectual means in the jurisdiction where the statute required an overt act. the essence of & criminal conspiracy is the unlawful combination and ordinarily the offence is complete when the combination is framed. from this it necessarily follows that unless the statute so requires no avert act need be d in furtherance of the conspiracy and that the object of the combination need not be accomplished in order to constitute an indictable offence. $$$ making conspiracy a crime is designed to curb immoderate power to do mischief which is gained by a combination of the means. the encouragement and support with co -conspirators give to t another rendering enterprises possible which if left to individual effort would have been impossible furnish the ground for visiting conspirators and abettors with condign punishment. the conspiracy is held to be continued and renewed as to all its members wherever and whenever any member of the conspiracy acts in furtherance of the common design see american jurisprudence vol.ii see. p. for an offence punishable under section prosecution need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators expressly agree to do or cause to be d illegal act the agreement may be proved by necessary implication. offence of criminal conspiracy has its foundation in an agreement to commit an offence. a conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of or more but in the agreement of or more to do an unlawful act by unlawful means. so long as such a design rests in intention only it is not indictable. when agree to carry it into effect the very plot is an act in itself and an act of each of the parties promise against promise actus contra actum capable of being enforced if lawful punishable if for a criminal object or for use of criminal means. no doubt in the case of conspiracy there can not be any direct evidence. the ingredients of offence are that there should be an agreement between persons who are alleged to conspire and the said agreement should be for doing an illegal act or for doing illegal means an act which itself may not be illegal. therefore the essence of criminal conspiracy is an agreement to do an illegal act and such an agreement can be proved either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or by both and it is a matter of common experience that direct evidence to prove conspiracy is rarely available. therefore the circumstances proved before during and after the occurrence have to be considered to decide about the complicity of the accused. in halsbury 's laws of england vide $$$. vol. page. page the english law as to conspiracy has been stated thus:"conspiracy consists in the agreement of or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. it is an indictable offence at common law the punishment for which is imprisonment of fine or both in the discretion of the court.the essence of the offence of conspiracy is the fact of combination by agreement. the agreement may be express or implied or in part express and in part implied. the conspiracy arises and the offence is committed as soon as the agreement is made and the offence continues to be committed so long as the combination persists that is until the conspiratorial agreement is terminated by completion of its performance or by abandonment or frustration or however it may be. the actus rues in a conspiracy is the agreement to execute the illegal conduct not the execution of it it is not enough that or more persons pursued the same unlawful object at the same time or in the same place it is necessary to show a meeting of minds a consensus to affect an unlawful purpose. it is not however necessary that each conspirator should have been in communication with every other. there is no difference between the mode of proof of the offence of conspiracy and that of any other offence it can be established by direct or circumstantial evidence. see $$$ lal $$$ etc. etc v. state of maharashtra air sc. it was held that the expression in reference to their common intention in section is very comprehensive and it appears to have been designedly used to give it a wider scope than the words in furtherance of in the english law with the result anything said. d or written by a co -conspirator after the conspiracy was formed will be evidence against the other before he entered the field of conspiracy or after he left it. anything said d or written is a relevant fact only.as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring as well as for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.in short the section can be analysed as follows there shall be a prime facie evidence affording a reasonable ground for a court to believe that or more persons are members of a conspiracy if the said condition is fulfilled anything said d or written by any of them in reference to their common intention will be evidence against the other anything said d or written by him should have been said d or written by him after the intention was formed by any of them it would also be relevant for the said purpose against another who entered the conspiracy whether it was said d or written before he entered the conspiracy or after he left it and it can only be used against a co -conspirator and not in his favour. we are aware of the fact that direct independent evidence of criminal conspiracy is generally not available and its existence is a matter of inference. the inference are normally deduced from acts of parties in pursuance of a purpose in common between the conspirators. this court in v.c. shukla v. state delhi admn.$$$ / sc/04/980$$$ / sc/04/980 held that to prove criminal conspiracy there must be evidence direct or circumstantial to show that there was an agreement between or more persons to commit an offence. there must be a meeting of minds resulting in ultimate decision taken by the conspirators regarding the commission of an offence and where the factum of conspiracy is sought to be inferred from circumstances the prosecution has to show that the circumstances give rise to a conclusive or irresistible inference of an agreement between or more persons to commit an offence. as in all other criminal offences the prosecution has to discharge its onus of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. the circumstances in a case when taken together on their face value should indicate the meeting of the minds between the conspirators for the intended object of committing an illegal act or an act which is not illegal by illegal means. a few bits here and a few bits there on which the prosecution relies can not be held to be adequate for connecting the accused with the commission of the crime of criminal conspiracy. it has to be shown that all means adopted and illegal acts d were in furtherance of the object of conspiracy hatched. the circumstances relied for the purposes of drawing an inference should be prior in time than the actual commission of the offence in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. privacy and secrecy are more characteristics of a conspiracy than of a loud discussion in an elevated place open to public view. direct evidence in proof of a conspiracy is seldom available offence of conspiracy can be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence. it is not always possible to give affirmative evidence about the date of the formation of the criminal conspiracy about the persons who took part in the formation of the conspiracy about the object which the objectors set before themselves as the object of conspiracy and about the manner in which the object of conspiracy is to be carried out all this is necessarily a matter of inference. the provisions of section 0a and 0b. ipc have brought the law of conspiracy in india in line with the english law by making the overt act unessential when the conspiracy is to commit any punishable offence. the english law on this matter is well settled. $$$ on crime $$$. vol. i. p. may be usefully noted--"the gist of the offence of conspiracy then lies not in doing the act or effecting the purpose for which the conspiracy is formed nor in attempting to do them nor in inciting others to do them but in the forming of the scheme of agreement between the parties agreement is essential. mere knowledge or even discussion of the plan is not per se enough.$$$ in the criminal law $$$. p. states--"the question arises in an low a case but it was discussed in terms of conspiracy rather than of accessoryship. d who had a grievance against p. told e that if he would whip p some would pay his fine. e replied that he did not want any to pay his fine that he had a grievance of his own against p and that he would whip him at the opportunity. e whipped p. d was acquitted of conspiracy because there was no agreement for concert of action no agreement to co -operate.coleridge. j. while summing up the case to jury in regina v. $$$ er at p. states:"i am bound to tell you that although the common design is the root of the charge it is not necessary to prove that these parties came together and actually agreed in terms to have this common design and to pursue it by common means and so to carry it into execution. this is not necessary because in any cases of the most clearly established conspiracies there are no means of proving any such thing and neither law nor common sense requires that it should be proved. if you find that these persons pursued by their acts the same object often by the same means performing part of an act so as to complete it with a view to the attainment of the object which they were pursuing you will be at liberty to draw the conclusion that they have been engaged in a conspiracy to effect that object. the question you have to ask yourselves is had they this common design and did they pursue it by these common means the design being unlawful. as noted above the essential ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit an offence. in a case where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by itself constitutes an offence then in that event no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecute on because in such a situation criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement. where the conspiracy alleged is with regard to commission of a serious crime of the nature as contemplated in section 0b read with the provision to sub -section of section 0a then in that event mere proof of an agreement between the accused for commission of such a crime al is enough to bring about a conviction under section 0b and the proof of any overt act by the accused or by any of them would not be necessary. the provisions in such a situation do not require that each and every person who is a party to the conspiracy must do some overt act towards the fulfilment of the object of conspiracy the essential ingredient being an agreement between the conspirators to commit the crime and if these requirements and ingredients are established the act would fall within the trapping of the provisions contained in section 0b see. s.c. bahari v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/000/994$$$ / sc/000/994. the conspiracies are not hatched in open by their nature they are secretly planned they can be proved even by circumstantial evidence the lack of direct evidence relating to conspiracy has no consequence. see. e.k. chandrasenan v. state of kerala $$$ / sc/00/99$$$ / sc/00/99. in kehar singh and ors. v. the state delhi administration $$$ / sc/04/988$$$ / sc/04/988 at p. this court observed:"generally a conspiracy is hatched in secrecy and it may be difficult to adduce direct evidence of the same. the prosecution will often rely on evidence of acts of various parties to infer that they were d in reference to their common intention. the prosecution will also more often rely upon circumstantial evidence. the conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by such evidence direct or circumstantial. but the court must enquire whether the persons are independently pursuing the same end or they have come together to the pursuit of the unlawful object. the former does not render them conspirators but the latter does. it is however essential that the offence of conspiracy required some kind of physical manifestation of agreement. the express agreement however need not be proved. nor actual meeting of the persons is necessary. nor it is necessary to prove the actual words of communication. the evidence as to transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design may be sufficient. conspiracy can be proved by circumstances and other materials. see state of bihar v. paramhans $$$ / bh/06/986$$$ / bh/06/986. to establish a charge of conspiracy knowledge about indulgence in either an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means is necessary. in some cases intent of unlawful use being made of the goods or services in question may be inferred from the knowledge itself. this apart the prosecution has not to establish that a particular unlawful use was intended so long as the goods or service in question could not be put to any lawful use. finally when the ultimate offence consists of a chain of actions it would not be necessary for the prosecution to establish to bring home the charge of conspiracy that each of the conspirators had the knowledge of what the collaborator would do so so long as it is known that the collaborator would put the goods of service to an unlawful use. see state of maharashtra v. som nath thapa $$$ / sc/04/996$$$ / sc/04/996. it was noticed that sections and ipc have brought the law of conspiracy in india in line with english law by making an overt act inessential when the conspiracy is to commit any punishable offence. the most important ingredient of the offence being the agreement between or more persons to do an illegal act. in a case where criminal conspiracy is alleged the court must inquire whether the persons are independently pursuing the same end or they have come together to pursue the unlawful object. the former does not render them conspirators but the latter does. for the offence of conspiracy some kind of physical manifestation of agreement is required to be established. the express agreement need not be proved. the evidence as to the transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful act is not sufficient. a conspiracy is a continuing offences which continues to subsists till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice of necessity. during its subsistence whenever any of the conspirators does an act or series of acts he would be held guilty under section of the indian penal code. i may usefully refer to $$$ v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/06/99$$$ / sc/06/99. it was held x"...it is not necessary that each conspirator must know all the details of the scheme nor be a participant at every stage. it is necessary that they should agree for design or object of the conspiracy. conspiracy is conceived as having elements agreement between or more persons by whom the agreement is effected and a criminal object which may be either the ultimate aim of the agreement or may constitute the means or of the means by which that aim is to be accomplished. it is immaterial whether this is found in the ultimate objects. the common law definition of criminal conspiracy was stated by lord denman in $$$ ' case that an indictment for conspiracy must charge a conspiracy to do an unlawful act by unlawful means and was elaborated by $$$ j. on behalf of the judges while referring the question to the house of lords in mulcahy v. reg and house of lords in unanimous decision reiterated in quinn v. leathem a conspiracy consists not merely in the intention of or more but in the agreement of or more to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. so long as such a design rest in intention only it is not indictable. when agree to carry it into effect the very plot is an act in itself and the act of each of the parties promise against promise actus contra actum capable of being enforced if lawful punishable of for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.this court in b.g. barsay v. state of bombay $$$ / sc/0/96$$$ / sc/0/96 held:"the gist of the offence is an agreement to break the law. the parties to such an agreement will be guilty of criminal conspiracy though the illegal act agreed to be d has not been d. so too it is an ingredient of the offence that all the parties should agree to do a single illegal act. it may comprise the commission of a number of acts. under section of the indian penal code an act would be illegal if it is an offence or it if is prohibited by law. in yash pal mittal v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/069/977$$$ / sc/069/977 the rule was laid as follows:'the very agreement concert or league is the ingredient of the offence. it is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of the conspiracy as long as they are co -participators in the main object of the conspiracy. there may be so many devices and techniques adopted to achieve the common goal of the conspiracy and there may be division of performances in the chain of actions with object to achieve the real end of which every collaborator must be aware and in which each of them must be interested. there must be unity of object or purpose but there may be plurality of means sometimes even unknown to another amongst the conspirators. in achieving the goal several offences may be committed by some of the conspirators even unknown to the others. the only relevant factor is that all means adopted and illegal acts d must be and purported to be in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy even though there may be sometimes misfire or overshooting by some of the conspirators.in $$$ and ors. v. state of maharashtra $$$ / sc/080/98$$$ / sc/080/98 it was held that for an offence under section 0b ipc the prosecution need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators expressly agreed to do or cause to be d the illegal act the agreement may be proved by necessary implication. after referring to some judgments of the united states supreme court and of this court in yash pal mittal v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/069/977$$$ / sc/069/977. and $$$ v. union of india $$$ / sc/06/99$$$ / sc/06/99 the court in state of maharashtra v. som nath thapa $$$ / sc/04/996$$$ / sc/04/996 summarized the position of law and the requirements to establish the charge of conspiracy as under. the aforesaid decisions weighty as they are lead us to conclude that to establish a charge of conspiracy knowledge about indulgence in either an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means is necessary. in some cases intent of unlawful use being made of the goods of services in question may be inferred from the knowledge itself.this apart the prosecution has not to establish that a particular unlawful use was intended so long as the goods or service in question could not be put to nay lawful use. finally when the ultimate offence consists of a chain of actions it would not be necessary for the prosecution to establish to bring home the charge of conspiracy that each of the conspirators had the knowledge of what the collaborator would do so long as it is known that the collaborator would put the goods or service to an unlawful use see $$$ / sc/060/000$$$ / sc/060/000 state of kerala v. p. $$$ and $$$. as was observed by this court in state of kerala v. p. $$$ and $$$. $$$ / sc/060/000$$$ / sc/060/000 it would be extremely difficult to find direct evidence in case of criminal conspiracy. the circumstances and surrounding factors have to be taken note of. in the instant case the accused and have submitted that the role of pw- as described is that he did not want to be directly shown in the picture. in fact a- wanted that mul did not want to involve brokers and did not want to deal with them. this itself deals of fatal blow to the stand taken by the accused that there was no prohibition of acting through brokers and the intention was that dealing would be directly with the bank and not through any broker or intermediary. much has been made out of use of the word through in the resolution. if the clear understanding of a- was that the deal should not be dealt with or involved any broker then the question of a- acting as broker does not arise. use of the expression through is indicative of the fact that emphasis was on securities being not purchased in the open market but through named psu. these psu were admittedly not brokers. they were either banks or financial institutions. evidence clearly shows that a- wanted that he will not directly come to the picture and would not appear in the books of accounts of mul but would stand to gain by way of commission and as a brokerage from the bank. the statement of a- that he would look into any good proposals if a- does not come to the picture shows that the actual state of affairs was intended to be hidden from the mul authorities and a totally distorted picture was sought to be given. these are factors which does not go in favour of the accused as contended and on the contrary clearly proves conspiracy. much has also been submitted that repayment has been made. that itself is not an indication of lack of dishst intention. some times it so happens that with a view to create confidence the repayments are made so that for the future transactions the my can be dishstly misappropriated. this is a part of the scheme and the factum of repayment can not be considered in isolation. the repayment as has been rightly contended by the solicitor general can be a factor to be considered while awarding sentence but can not be a ground for providing innocence of the accused. section deals with criminal breach of trust by public servant or by banker merchant or agent. section defines criminal breach of trust. the offence like the offence of criminal misappropriation is characterized by an actual fraudulent appropriation of property. there is not originally wrongful taking or moving as in the case of theft but the offence consists in wrongful appropriation of property consequent upon a possession which is lawful. the offence is distinguishable from criminal misappropriation because subject of it is not the property which by some casual act or otherwise but without criminal means comes into the offender 's possession but the property which is entrusted to the offender by the owner or by others lawful authority and which the offender holds subject to some duty or obligation to apply it according to the trust. sections to make special provisions for various cases in which property is entrusted to the enumerated categories of persons who commit the offence. the offence of breach of trust and dishst misappropriation are sufficient to constitute an offence under the relevant provisions. to constitute an offence of criminal breach of trust there must be an entrustment there must be misappropriation or conversion to 's own use or use in violation of legal direction or of any legal contract and the misappropriation or conversion or disposal must be with a dishst intention. when a person allows others to misappropriate the my entrusted to him that amounts to a criminal appropriation of trust as defined by section. the section relatable to property in a positive part and a negative part. the positive part deals with criminal misappropriation or conversion of the property and the negative part consists of dishstly using or disposing of the property in violation of any direction and of law or any contract touching the discharge of trust. in $$$ v. the state of bombay $$$ / sc/000/96$$$ / sc/000/96 it was held that if the managing director of the bank entrusted with securities owned by the pledgor disposes of their securities against the stipulated terms of the contract entered into by the parties with an intent to cause wrongful loss to the pledgor and wrongful gain to the bank there can be no question but that the managing director has necessarily mens rea required by section. the term entrustment is not necessarily a term of law. it may have different implications in different context. in its most general signification all it imports is the handing over possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all. when a person misappropriates to his own use the property that does not belong to him the misappropriation is dishst even though there was an intention to restore it at somefuture point of time. as noted by this court in $$$ and $$$. v. state of bombay $$$ / sc/0084/960$$$ / sc/0084/960 to establish the charge of criminal breach of trust the prosecution is not obliged to prove the precise mode of conversion misappropriation or misapplication by the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he has dominion. the principal ingredient of the offence being dishst misappropriation or conversion which may not ordinarily be a matter of direct proof entrustment of property and failure in breach of an obligation to account for the property entrusted if proved may in the light of other circumstances justifiably lead to an inference of dishst misappropriation or conversion. section deals with cheating and dishstly inducing delivery of property. the offence of cheating is made of ingredients. $$$ of any person and fraudulently or dishstly inducing that person to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property. to put it differently the ingredients of the offence are that the person deceived delivers to a valuable security or property that the person so deceived was induced to do so that such person acted on such inducement in consequence of his having been deceived by the accused and that the accused acted fraudulently or dishstly when so inducing the person. to constitute the offence of cheating it is not necessary that the deception should be by express words but it may be by conduct or implied in the nature of the transaction itself. section relates to forgery of such documents as valuable securities and of other documents mentid. section deals with forgery for the purpose of cheating. the offence is complete as soon as there was forgery with a particular intent. section deals with using as genuine a forged document. for the purpose of convicting an accused under section read with section ipc it has to be shown that an accused either knew or has reason to believe that the document was forged. section defines forgery and section deals with making a false statement. section reads as follows:"46. forgery whoever makes any false documents or false electronic record or part of a document or electronic record with intent to cause damage or injury to the public or to any person or to support any claim or title or to cause any person to part with property or to enter into any express or implied contract or with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed commits forgery. in order to constitute forgery the essential is that the accused should have made a false document. the false document must be made with an intent to cause damage or injury to the public or to any class of public or to any community. the expression intent to defraud implies conduct coupled with intention to deceive or thereby to cause injury. in other words defraud involves conceptions namely the deceit and injury to the person deceived that is infringement of some legal right possessed by him but not necessarily deprivation of property. the term forgery as used in the statue is used in its ordinary and popular acceptation. the definition of the offence of forgery declares the offence to be completed when a false document or false part of a document is made with specified intention. the questions are is the document fase ii is it made by the accused and iii is it made with an intent to defraud. if at all the questions are answered in the affirmative the accused is quilty. in order to constitute an offence of forgery the documents must be made dishstly or fraudulently. but dishst or fraudulent are not tautological. fraudulent does not imply the deprivation of property or an element of injury. in order to be fraudulent there must be some advantage on the side with a corresponding loss on the other. every forgery postulates a false document either in whole or in part however small. the intent to commit forgery involves an intent to cause injury. a person makes a false document who dishonestly or fraudulently sings with an intent or cause to believe that the document was signed by a person whom he knows it was not signed. a false description makes a document of forgery when it is found that the accused by giving such false description intended to make out or wanted it to believe that it was not he that was executing the document but another person. the accused persons have tried to take shelter behind what they have described as market practices. such practices even if existing can not take the place of statutory and regulatory functions. there is no public interest involved in such practices and they can not be a substitute for compliance with the regulatory or statutory prescriptions. an attempt was made to show that there was subsequent disapproval of the market practices at the point of time when the transactions took place there was no embargo. it is their stand that the practices were a part of accepted norms. we do not find anything plausible in these explanations. a practice even if was prevailing if wrong is not to be approved. the subsequent clarifications do not in any way it seal the approval of the practices adopted on the past on the other hand it contemns it. when the factual background highlighted is considered in the light of the various provisions it is clear that the offences under the indian penal code alleged have been established against the accused persons. the learned special judge was therefore justified in convicting accused and. section of the pc act is intended to deal with aberrations public servants. in view of the finding that a- in furtherance of criminal conspiracy in his capacity as public servant abused his position by causing and/or allowing mul 's funds to be utilized for the wrongful gain of a- provisions of section read with section are clearly applicable. similar is the position vis -a -vis a-. the offence in these cases were not of the conventional or traditional type. the ultimate objective was to use public money in a carefully planned manner for personal use with no right to do it. funds of the public bodies were utilized as it they were private funds. there was not legitimacy in the transactions. huge funds running into of crores of mul a government company were diverted and all the concerned accused persons a- a- and a- played dubious roles in these illegitimate transactions. their acts had serious repercussions on the economic system of the country and the magnitude of financial of financial impact involved in the present appeal is only tip of the iceberg. there were several connected cases and interestingly some of the prosecution witnesses in the present case are stated to be accused in those cases. that itself explains the thread of self -perseverance running through their testimony. therefore the need to pierce the facadial smoke screen to unravel the truth to lift the veil so that the apparent which is not real can be avoided. the proverbial red herrings are to be ignored to find out the guilt of the accused. the cause of the community deserves better treatment at the hands of the court in the discharge of its judicial functions. the community or the state is not a persons non grata whose cause may be treated with disdain. the entire community is aggrieved if economic offenders who ruin the economy of the state are not brought to book. a murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused. an economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eve on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the community. a disregard for the interest of the community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the community in the system to administer justice in an even handed manner without fear of criticism from $$$$ which view white collar crimes with a permissive eye unmindful of the damage done to the national economy and national interest as was aptly stated in state of gujarat v. $$$ jitamalji porwal and $$$. $$$ / sc/0288/987$$$ / sc/0288/987. unfortunately in $$$$ the country has seen an alarming rise in white -collar crimes which has affected the fibre of the country 's economic structure. these cases are nothing but private gain at the cost of public and lead to economic disaster. the convictions of accused and are in order and are maintained. a question about the sentence was raised. normally in cases involving offences which corrode the economic stability are to be dealt with sternly. it is however noticed that a-5 has died during the pendency of the appeal. a-1 and a-3 were small flies who appear to have been caught in the web of a-5 's machinations. apparent reason for their involvement is greed and avarice. there may be substance in the plea raised by the learned counsel for the accused -appellants that higher ups of mul and banks can not certainly be unaware of the goings on and have not been proceeded with and given clear chit. though this is certainly a matter of concern yet that can not be a ground for taking a sympathetic view of a-1 and a-3 's conduct. considering the fact that the occurrence took place $$$$ back and the trial has spread over $$$$ and the death of a-5 we feel custodial sentence for the period already undergone which we are told was for $$$$ would meet the ends of the justice. while fixing the quantum of sentence we have duly considered the fact that in the instant case the amounts have been paid back which as noted above learned counsel for the prosecution conceded was a factor for fixing the quantum of sentence. the fine amounts imposed remain unaltered with the default sentence. appeals by a-1 a-3 and a-5 are dismissed subject to modification or sentence. we respectfully agree with conclusions of learned brother $$$ though not with the reasoning in their entirety regarding dismissal of the appeals against acquittal of a-2 and setting aside the conviction of a-4.
