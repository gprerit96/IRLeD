as the fir dated.was registered against both the appellants for the offences punishable under sections and of indian penal code for short indian penal code. the allegations made therein were that both the appellants furnished wrong information to the investigating officer regarding their names father 's name and address during the course of investigation made on the fir and also in the bail applications filed by them before the learned cjm in the case arising out of fir. the fir was investigated by the investigating officer and a report under section of code of criminal procedure was filed before cjm $$$ for taking cognizance of the offences alleged against the appellants. the learned cjm took cognizance of the alleged offences vide order dated.. the appellants filed revision

arising out of fir has already been set aside. the learned single judge did not find any merit in the said petition filed before her and she accordingly dismissed the same with a direction to the trial court to conclude the trial expeditiously. hence this appeal with request to set aside the same and allow the application made under section of code of criminal procedure by the appellants seeking their discharge of the offences alleged in the fir. mr. $$$ the learned counsel on behalf of the appellants contended that the high court has failed to appreciate the fact that offences under the fir were allegedly committed during the course of investigation made on the fir thus it forms the part of same transaction with the offences in respect of which the fir was registered. therefore instead of institution of the fir a further investigation as provided under sub -section 8) to section of code of criminal procedure should have been d in respect of the offences alleged under fir with the leave of the court. but no such further investigation was conducted by the investigating officer in respect of the said offences. thus it is urged that the registration of fir is wholly untenable in law and therefore liable to be quashed. it was further contended by him that the reasons given by the high court in the impugned order in dismissing $$$. misc. petition holding that the proceedings arising out of fir has already been set aside and at present more case is surviving against the appellants arising out of fir is not tenable in law for the reason that the offences under the fir are of the same transaction with the fir as they were allegedly committed in the course of investigation made on the fir. thus there was no need for the institution of fir against them. he further submitted that the registration of fir is illegal and void ab -initio in law as the same is in violation of article of the of india and also contrary to section of code of criminal procedure and section of the general clauses act. he further vehemently contended that the high court has erred in not appreciating the law regarding the impermissibility of registration of the fir against the appellants in respect of an offence or different offences committed in the course of same transaction. he placed strong reliance upon paras and.of the judgment of this court in the case of $$$ v. central bureau of investigation and anr. $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ scc which relevant paragraphs are extracted in the reasoning portion of this judgment. he further submitted that the high court has failed to appreciate the important aspect of the case that the fir registered against the appellants for the offences alleged to have committed forms the same transaction and therefore registering another case against the appellants is not permissible in law as laid down by this court in the case referred to supra and the same is against the principle of double jeopardy as enshrined in article of the constitution of india. thus the impugned order passed by the high court is vitiated in law and the same is liable to be set aside by this court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. it was further contended by him that the high court has not appreciated the fact that even on merits both the appellants never furnished wrong information to the investigation officer about their identity. in this regard he had submitted that during the course of investigation on the fir the investigation officer after verification found the name of appellant no. to be $$$ and not $$$ jha. similarly with regard to appellant no. his father 's name was also found to be late ramanand prasad. the learned counsel urged that appellant no. $$$ is also known as $$$. the same fact has also been certified by mukhiya gram panchayat sonma purnea district. further the father 's name of appellant no. ajit prasad is late ramendra prasad who was also known as late ramananda prasad. therefore both the appellants can not be said to have furnished any wrong information to the investigation officer regarding their identity as alleged in the fir. it was further contended by him that the high court has failed to appreciate another important fact that both the appellants were not instrumental in creating any dubious document for the purpose of cheating the police as alleged in the fir. the fir was recorded by the police officer and thus both the appellants should not be held responsible for wrong information written by the police in the fir. the learned counsel for the appellants prayed for allowing this appeal and requested this court to set aside the impugned order passed by the high court and requested for discharge of both the appellants for the alleged offences under the fir. per contra mr. $$$ the learned counsel on behalf of the respondent -state sought to justify the impugned order passed by the high court and the order passed by the learned judicial magistrate of class dismissing the application under section of code of criminal procedure filed by the appellants for the alleged offences under fir on the ground that the same are well founded and are not vitiated in law. therefore no interference with the same by this court is required in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. we have carefully examined the rival contentions urged on behalf of both the parties and the decision of this court in the case of $$$ case supra upon which the strong reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the appellants. the relevant paras of the abovesaid case cited by him read thus:$$$$. this court has consistently laid down the law on the issue interpreting the code that a fir in respect of an offence or different offences committed in the course of the same transaction is not only impermissible but it violates article of the constitution. in t.t. $$$ this court has categorically held that registration of fir which is not a cross -case is violative of article of the constitution. the following conclusion in paras and of that judgment are relevant which read as under scc pp. -&. the scheme of code of criminal procedure is that an officer in charge of a police station has to commence investigation as provided in section or code of criminal procedure on the basis of entry of the information report on coming to know of the commission of a cognizable offence. on completion of investigation and on the basis of the evidence collected he has to form an opinion under section or code of criminal procedure as the case may be and forward his report to the magistrate concerned under section code of criminal procedure. however even after filing such a report if he comes into possession of further information or material he need not register a fresh fir he is empowered to make further investigation normally with the leave of the court and where during further investigation he collects further evidence oral or documentary he is obliged to forward the same with or more further reports this is the import of sub -section 8) of section code of criminal procedure. from the above discussion it follows that under the scheme of the provisions of sections and code of criminal procedure only the earliest or the information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the requirements of section code of criminal procedure. thus there can be no fir and consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or incident giving rise to or more cognizable offences. on receipt of information about a cognizable offence or an incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or offences and on entering the fir in the station house diary the officer in charge of a police station has to investigate not merely the cognizable offence reported in the fir but also other connected offences found to have been committed in the course of the same transaction or the same occurrence and file or more reports as provided in section code of criminal procedure. a just balance between the fundamental rights of the citizens under $$$ and of the constitution and the expansive power of the police to investigate a cognizable offence has to be struck by the court. there can not be any controversy that sub -section 8) of section code of criminal procedure empowers the police to make further investigation obtain further evidence both oral and documentary and forward a further report or reports to the magistrate. in narang case it was however observed that it would be appropriate to conduct further investigation with the permission of the court. however the sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting a citizen each time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident giving rise to or more cognizable offences consequent upon filing of successive firs whether before or after filing the final report under section code of criminal procedure. it would clearly be beyond the purview of sections and code of criminal procedure nay a case of abuse of the statutory power of investigation in a given case. in our view a case of fresh investigation based on the or successive firs not being a counter -case filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable offence alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction and in respect of which pursuant to the fir either investigation is under way or final report under section has been forwarded to the magistrate may be a fit case for exercise of power under section code of criminal procedure or under $$$ of the constitution.the above referred declaration of law by this court has never been diluted in any subsequent judicial pronouncements even while carving out exceptions. mr. raval learned asg by referring t.t. $$$ submitted that the said principles are not applicable and relevant to the facts and circumstances of this case as the said judgment laid down the ratio that there can not be firs relating to the same offence or occurrence. the learned asg further pointed out that in the present case there are distinct incidents / occurrences inasmuch as being the conspiracy relating to the murder of $$$ with the help of $$$ and the other being the conspiracy to murder $$$ -a potential witness to the earlier conspiracy to murder $$$. we are unable to accept the claim of the learned asg. as a matter of fact the aforesaid proposition of law making registration of fresh fir impermissible and violative of article of the constitution is reiterated and reaffirmed in the following subsequent decisions of this court $$$ v. $$$ $$$ v. state of gujarat chirra $$$ v. state of a.p.and c. muniappan v. state of t.n. in c. muniappan this court explained the consequence test i. if an offence forming part of the fir arises as a consequence of the offence alleged in the fir then offences covered by both the firs are the same and accordingly the fir will be impermissible in law. in other words the offences covered in both the firs shall have to be treated as a part of the fir.. even after filing of such a report if he comes into possession of further information or material there is no need to register a fresh fir he is empowered to make further investigation normally with the leave of the court and where during further investigation he collects further evidence oral or documentary he is obliged to forward the same with or more further reports which is evident from sub -section 8) of section of the code. under the scheme of the provisions of sections and of the code only the earliest or the information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the requirements of section of the code. thus there can be no fir and consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or incident giving rise to or more cognizable offences. the fir was registered against the appellants on a written complaint of $$$ inspector of police at $$$ police station. it was found by the investigating officer during the course of investigation in the fir that real name of the appellant no. was $$$ $$$ / o $$$ r / o gram akbarpur district purnea and was found to be working as development officer at new india assurance company ltd. branch purnia contrary to the same the personal information was furnished by him at the time of investigation of the case on the fir. similarly with regard to the appellant no. his father 's name was found to be late ramendra prasad and not late ramanand. his actual address was found to be ranipatti p.s. kumarkhand district madhepura and he was found to be working as surveyor and investigator of all branches of general assurance company. it is also alleged in the fir that both the appellants had not disclosed their correct names father 's name their address and occupation in the bail applications filed by them in respect of the case arising out of fir before the additional sessions judge. from a bare perusal of fir it is abundantly clear that both the appellants have furnished wrong information to the police as to their names father 's name and address during the course of investigation made on the fir. this court is of the view that the offences alleged to have committed by them are mentid in fir which offences are distinct offences committed by both the appellants and the same have no connection with the offences for which the fir was registered against them. therefore for the reason stated supra the contention urged by the learned counsel on behalf of both the appellants that instead of institution of fir for the said offences a further investigation as provided under sub -section 8) to section of code of criminal procedure should have been d by the investigation officer on the ground of they being the part of same transaction with offences registered under fir is wholly untenable in law and liable to be rejected. further the decision of this court in the case of $$$ supra upon which strong reliance is placed by the learned counsel on behalf of both the appellants does not render any assistance to them in the case at hand. this court in the said case after examining the relevant provisions of code of criminal procedure has categorically held thus:. the various provisions of the code of criminal procedure clearly show that an officer -in -charge of a police station has to commence investigation as provided in section or of the code on the basis of entry of the information report on coming to know of the commission of cognizable offence. on completion of investigation and on the basis of the evidence collected the investigating officer has to form an opinion under section or of the code and forward his report to the magistrate concerned under section of the code.. even after filing of such a report if he comes into possession of further information or material there is no need to register a fresh fir he is empowered to make further investigation normally with the leave of the court and where during further investigation he collects further evidence oral or documentary he is obliged to forward the same with or more further reports which is evident from sub -section 8) of section of the code. under the scheme of the provisions of sections and of the code only the earliest or the information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the requirements of section of the code. thus there can be no fir and consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or incident giving rise to or more cognizable offences.. the information report is a report which gives information with regard to any offence. there can not be fir in respect of the same offence / event because whenever any further information is received by the investigating agency it is always in furtherance of the fir.emphasis supplied by this court)$$$$. it is well settled principle of law that there can be no fir in the event of any further information being received by the investigating agency in respect of offence or the same occurrence or incident giving rise to or more offences for which chargesheet has already been filed by the investigating agency. the recourse available with the investigating agency in the said situation is to conduct further investigation normally with the leave of the court as provided under sub -section 8) to section of code of criminal procedure the reliance is placed on the decision of this court rendered in t.t. $$$ v. state of kerala manu / sc/0$$$$/$$$$manu / sc/0$$$$/$$$$ scc relevant paras of which read $$$$. the scheme of code of criminal procedure is that an officer in charge of a police station has to commence investigation as provided in section or code of criminal procedure on the basis of entry of the information report on coming to know of the commission of a cognizable offence. on completion of investigation and on the basis of the evidence collected he has to form an opinion under section or code of criminal procedure as the case may be and forward his report to the magistrate concerned under section code of criminal procedure. however even after filing such a report if he comes into possession of further information or material he need not register a fresh fir he is empowered to make further investigation normally with the leave of the court and where during further investigation he collects further evidence oral or documentary he is obliged to forward the same with or more further reports this is the import of sub -section 8) of section code of criminal procedure.xx1..the code of criminal procedure specifically provides for further investigation after forwarding of report under sub -section of section code of criminal procedure and forwarding of further report or reports to the magistrate concerned under section code of criminal procedure. it follows that if the gravamen of the charges in the firs -the and the -is in truth and substance the same registering the fir and making fresh investigation and forwarding report under section code of criminal procedure will be irregular and the court can not take cognizance of the same.emphasis supplied)$$$$. however this principle of law is not applicable to the fact situation in the instant case as the substance of the allegations in the said firs is different. the fir deals with offences punishable under sections and of the act whereas the fir deals with the offences punishable under sections and of indian penal code which are alleged to have committed during the course of investigation of the case in the fir. this court is of the view that the alleged offences under the fir in substance are distinct from the offences under the fir and they can not in any case said to be in the form of the part of same transaction with the alleged offences under the fir. therefore no question of further investigation could be made by the investigating agency on the alleged offences arisen as the term further investigation occurred under sub -section 8) to section of code of criminal procedure connotes the investigation of the case in continuation of the earlier investigation with respect to which the chargesheet has already been filed. the reliance is placed on the judgment of this court in the case of rama chaudhary v. state of bihar manu / sc/05/$$$$manu / sc/05/$$$$ scc the relevant para reads thus:. from a plain reading of sub -section and sub -section 8) of section it is evident that even after submission of the police report under sub -section on completion of the investigation the police has a right to further investigation under sub -section 8) of section but not fresh investigation or reinvestigation. the meaning of further is additional more or supplemental. further investigation therefore is the continuation of the earlier investigation and not a fresh investigation or reinvestigation to be started ab initio wiping out the earlier investigation altogether.emphasis supplied)27. therefore for the above said reasons the submissions made on behalf of both the appellants are not tenable in law and the same can not be accepted by this court. further the case of $$$ supra upon which strong reliance is placed by the learned counsel for both the appellants is also totally inapplicable to the fact situation and it does not support the case of both the appellants. for the reasons stated supra this court does not find any reason either to interfere with the impugned order passed by the high court or with the order of dismissal dated.passed by the judicial magistrate class $$$ on the application made under section of code of criminal procedure filed by the appellants. accordingly this appeal being devoid of merit is dismissed. the order dated.granting stay shall be vacated. hon'ble mr. justice v. $$$ pronounced the judgment of the bench comprising hon'ble the chief justice and his lordship. leave granted. the appeal is dismissed in terms of the signed non -reportable judgment.
