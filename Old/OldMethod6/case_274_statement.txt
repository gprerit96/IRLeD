objects. the accused were questid under section code of criminal procedure about the incriminating evidence and circumstances and the accused denied all of them. some of the accused stated that the date of incident was eid and that they were celebrating eid and they were not present at the scene of occurrence. $$$ came with a specific case that in the year he had purchased a piece of land from

charges under sections and indian penal code and they were convicted under section indian penal code and the substantive sentence was reduced to the period already underg. $$$ the appellants have filed criminal appeal no. challenging the acquittal of other accused persons state has also preferred the appeals. $$$ for the appellants stressed on the point that the f.i.r. mentid names of only accused persons and only subsequently more names were added and there was gross over -implication of accused persons. it was submitted that it is evident from the statement of investigating officer and other witnesses that the possession of the land in dispute was with the accused and this fact alters the entire prosecution case. it was argued that the instant case was a of free fight and since individual liability of the accused persons could not be ascertained and the appellants could not have been convicted under sections indian penal code and sections indian penal code. $$$ for the respondent -state submitted that the appellants and other accused persons formed themselves into an unlawful assembly in furtherance of their common object caused murder of $$$ and $$$ while causing fatal injuries to $$$ and the evidence of the eye -witnesses pws & ) clearly established the overt act of the accused persons. it was further contended that the land in dispute was in possession and ownership of $$$ and the accused persons were aggressors and the accused had no right of defence in protection of their property. it was contended that since overt act of the individual accused has been clearly proved by the prosecution the high court ought not to have acquitted the other accused persons. we have carefully considered the rival submissions of the parties and perused the evidence on record and the impugned judgment. the dispute between the parties pertains to the land-1 bighas. the said land was sold by $$$ to appellant -$$$ for a consideration of rs. and the possession of the field is said to have been handed over to $$$. ex d is the sale agreement dated.executed by $$$ in favour of $$$. regarding the land there was a litigation then going on between the parties. case of prosecution is that the accused party went to the field and attempted to dispossess $$$ and $$$ and thereby alleged to have caused the death of $$$ and $$$ and also caused injuries to$$$. by careful reading of evidence and materials on record it is seen that the accused party was in actual possession of the land and the complainant 's party had g to the field to take forcible possession. $$$ had admitted that about or days prior to the incident her husband $$$ and her elder son $$$ had forcibly taken over possession of the field and $$$ and $$$ thwarted the same. $$$ had stated that $$$ told them that he would arrange to put them in possession of the field and therefore on the said date the complainant party had g to the field with him. she had also admitted that there was crop of narma in the field. $$$ had also stated that on the date of incident i..$$$ her brother $$$ $$$ $$$ and few others went to take possession of the land and that $$$ was armed with gun. pw- being an injured witness her evidence stands on higher footing and is entitled to greater weight. for proper appreciation of the case as to the genesis of the occurrence we may usefully extract the evidence of pw- as elicited during her cross -examination which is as under..whether this land was sold by her husband to $$$ in $$$$ for a consideration of rs. and the documents were executed. herself stated that this fact is known to maternal uncle and maternal nephew. it is true that before -days of the incident her husband and her elder son had forcibly taken over the possession of the field and $$$ $$$ had put her husband her son and her articles in a tractor and left the same near jalasar railway line. it is also true that thereafter on $$$$ $$$ her brother $$$ her son $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ went to take over the possession of the field and had sit down in the field. it is also true that on $$$$ due to the apprehension that $$$ would again dispel them from the field therefore $$$ had bring the gun of his brother and $$$ had bring crackers gun..evidence of pw- that accused were actually in possession of the field and that her husband $$$ $$$ and $$$ made an unsuccessful attempt to take forcible possession of $$$$ before the incident is amply strengthened by the evidence of $$$-the investigating officer. in the cross -examination $$$ had clearly admitted that on the date of incident $$$ and his party were holding the possession over the field and that the field was cultivated by $$$ through his $$$ and at the time of incident narma crop had been raised in the field by $$$ on behalf of $$$. $$$ had also admitted that during the course of investigation it emerged that on.the complainant party had made an unsuccessful attempt to take forcible possession of the land. $$$ had clearly admitted that on the date of incident the accused party were holding the possession of the land in dispute. from the evidence of $$$ and from ext d.it is seen that there was a counter case in f.i.r. no. the judgment of the said case is ext d.which also indicates that the accused party was in possession of the land in dispute. ext d.is the sale agreement dated.executed by $$$ in favour of $$$ also indicates possession of the land by the accused persons. the accused persons seems to have produced exts. d.and to show that they were in possession of the land in dispute as it emerges from the evidence that the possession of the land was with the accused and that the complainant party armed with gun went to the field to take forcible possession of the property raises serious doubts about the genesis of occurrence as projected by the prosecution.  $$$ has stated that $$$ $$$ was preparing the tea inside the hut and that the accused party came in group and that the appellants inflicted injuries to $$$ while he was sleeping in a cot nearby and that $$$ inflicted axe blow on the right leg of $$$. $$$ had also stated that she was preparing the tea inside the hut on the stove of brick and tea was being prepared in a topia and that after the incident the topia and stove were left there in the hut. ext p.is the site plan in which the hut and the scene of occurrence is marked. when $$$ investigating officer was confronted with the site plan ext p.he stated that he had not noted any stove in ext p. $$$ had also stated that in the place of incident he had not seen any topia or utensil for preparing the tea. on the other hand $$$ had stated that a broken wooden pestle of the air gun was found lying inside the hut. as stated by pws and if really tea was prepared in the hut at the time of incident in the melee topia stove and utensils would have been scattered inside the hut. the fact that neither stove nor utensils were found by $$$$ investigating officer also improvableness the case as suggested by the prosecution that the accused are the aggressors. pws and have spoken about the overt act of the appellants that appellant gurmukh singh inflicted blows with gandasi on the neck of $$$ and $$$ inflicted injuries with the spear on the scalp. pw- injured witness had also stated about the injuries being caused to $$$ by the appellants. we are in agreement with the concurrent views of the courts below regarding their overt acts as the same is proved by the version of eye witnesses particularly pw- who has been consistent in her deposition regarding the participation and fatal injuries inflicted by the appellants. but as far as their conviction under sections 302/34 indian penal code is concerned in the facts and circumstances we are unable to agree with the view taken by the high court. as per exception to section indian penal code culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. to invoke exception to section indian penal code requisites must be satisfied namely it was a sudden fight there was no premeditation the act was committed in a heat of passion and the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner. this court in sridhar bhuyan v. state of orissa manu / $$$ / sc/0594/04 scc held as under:7. for bringing in operation of exception to section indian penal code it has to be established that the act was committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel without the offender having taken undue advantage and not having acted in a cruel or unusual manner. the exception of section indian penal code covers acts d in a sudden fight. the said exception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the exception after which its place would have been more appropriate. the exception is founded upon the same principle for in both there is absence of premeditation. but while in the case of exception there is total deprivation of self -control in case of exception there is only that heat of passion which clouds men 's sober reason and urges them to deeds which they would not otherwise do. there is provocation in exception as in exception but the injury d is not the direct consequence of that provocation. in fact exception deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel may have originated yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. a sudden fight implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. the homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on side. for if it were so the exception more appropriately applicable would be exception. there is no previous deliberation or determination to fight. a fight suddenly takes place for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. it may be that of them starts it but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would not have taken the serious turn it did. there is then mutual provocation and aggravation and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to each fighter. the help of exception can be invoked if death is caused a without premeditation in a sudden fight without the offender 's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner and the fight must have been with the person killed. to bring a case within exception all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. it is to be noted that the fight occurring in exception to section indian penal code is not defined in indian penal code. it takes to make a fight. heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. a fight is a combat between and more persons whether with or without weapons. it is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. it is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. for the application of exception it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. it must further be shown that the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. the expression undue advantage as used in the provision means unfair advantage.in satish narayan sawant v. state of goa manu / sc/1628/$$$$manu / sc/1628/$$$$ scc the same principle was reiterated. as noticed earlier $$$ had sold the property to $$$ in and that $$$ had been in possession of the land. on behalf of $$$ $$$ had been cultivating the land. it is brought in evidence that on the date of the incident there was narma crop standing in the field which was cultivated by the said $$$. as seen from the evidence of pw-8 the complainant 's party namely rakhia $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ numbering had gone to take forcible possession. as seen from ext p.accused were about in number viz.$$$ $$$ $$$ zakir subhan sheru and gurmukh singh were present. there seems to be mutual provocation and aggravation as the complainant party went to take possession of the land there appears to be scuffle between the parties. there was no previous deliberation or pre -meditation and the incident is a result of sudden fight. as elaborated earlier complainant party went to the field and $$$ was armed with gun. in the sudden fight there was a scuffle. during the course of scuffle the appellants inflicted injuries on the deceased $$$. the accused tried to grapple the gun from sabbir shah. there was no premeditation and that the incident was the result of sudden fight. in the scuffle other accused inflicted injuries on $$$ and pw-8 rakhia. considering the facts and circumstances of the case in our view the present case can not be said to be a case punishable under section indian penal code but a case falling under exception to section indian penal code. since the appellants inflicted injuries on the neck and scalp of sabbir shah with the intention of causing death and the act of the accused -appellants is punishable under section part i indian penal code. insofar as the appeal against acquittal filed by the state the high court has recorded finding that accused $$$ and $$$ caused injuries to $$$ on the left leg and left shoulder. inspite of treatment $$$ died due to fat embolism due to multiple injuries and due to injuries caused to the bones. upon consideration of evidence and having regard to the nature of injuries and cause of death the high court modified the conviction of $$$ and $$$ as under section indian penal code and reduced the substantive sentence to the period already undergone. high court has analyzed the evidence and observed that the evidence is omnibus and generalized and that no specific overt act is attributed to the remaining accused. as pointed out earlier names of only persons are mentioned in the information report. in the facts and circumstances of the case the high court can not be said to have misdirected itself in acquitting other accused. in the facts and circumstances of the case we do not find any substantial ground to interfere with the order of acquittal recorded by the high court. the conviction of the appellants ahmed shah and gurmukh singh under sections 302/34 indian penal code is modified as conviction under section part i indian penal code and the substantive sentence of life imprisonment is reduced to the period of sentence already undergone by them and the appeal preferred by the accused -appellants is partly allowed. the accused be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case. the appeals preferred by the state are dismissed.
