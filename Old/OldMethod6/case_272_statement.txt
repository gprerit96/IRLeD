f.m. $$$ j. leave granted. this appeal is directed against the judgment of the high court of judicature of gujarat at ahmedabad in arbitration petition no. dated... by the impugned judgment the learned single judge of the high court dismissed the $$$ 's application filed under section of the arbitration and conciliation act hereinafter referred to act. short facts which are required to be noted are that the $$$ and the respondent entered into a memorandum of understanding $$$ on.. under the said $$$ the $$$ proposed to constitute a joint venture along with chinese company namely m / s. qing tongxia aluminium group company ltd. ningxia of china hereinafter referred to as qtx as well as the respondent for setting up an alumina plant of appropriate capacity in the kutch district of gujarat. the $$$ also records that the government of gujarat agreed to encourage and support the proposed joint venture for setting up of the alumina plant. the respondent agreed to supply on priority basis medium grade bauxite to the proposed plant from its existing and expected bauxite mining leases in the kutch district. the other relevant terms were that the $$$ should arrange for the equity participation of the qtx in the proposed joint venture that the respondent should invest in the equity of the joint venture to the extent determined by the government of gujarat but not exceeding % while the $$$ and the qtx should hold % of the equity. the capacity of the proposed plant should be.tonnes per annum which may be enhanced subsequently. on the part of the respondent it should assist the joint venture in obtaining the required land for locating the project. under clauses and the quantity of the medium grade bauxite to be supplied by the respondent the grade of the bauxite the specifications the rate at which it was to be supplied the time within which such supply should be effected were all set out which also included a long term agreement for the supply to be entered into. $$$ also stipulated certain other conditions by which the $$$ was obligated upon to reimburse to the respondent within days of the signing of the $$$ an amount of rs.crores being the direct expenses incurred by the respondent on its alumina project and related matter. it is not in dispute that within the stipulated time limit the $$$ gave its cheque for the said sum but the respondent did not encash the same. it also provided for the $$$ to pay the respondent a further sum of rs.crores within days of the execution of the $$$ by way of signature bonus apart from providing a bank guarantee to the value of rs. crores for the due observance for the joint venture by the $$$ under the various terms and conditions of the $$$ within days of the signing of the $$$. clause of the $$$ specifically provided that the rights and privileges were not transferable for a period of years and the $$$ should not exit the project / joint venture for a period of years after the commencement of commercial production. under clause it was stipulated that the $$$ was subject to approval of the board of directors of the $$$ as well as the respondent that the equity investment and decisions of the respondent should be subject to the concurrence of the government of gujarat while the investment of the $$$ should be subject to approval of its shareholders. it was specifically mentid that both the $$$ and the respondent should endeavour to obtain necessary approval within months from the date of execution of the $$$. it was further specifically mentid that on getting necessary approval by both sides the $$$ would be converted into an agreement between the $$$ and the respondent. clause contained relevant stipulation to the effect that in case the concurrence of the government of gujarat was not forthcoming for equity participation in the project within months of the signing of the $$$ the $$$ would be construed as relating to long term supply of medium grade bauxite to the joint venture by the respondent from its kutch mines. the more important clauses contained in $$$ pertaining to arbitration are found in clauses and which read as under:. in the event of difference disputes arising between the parties in respect of any matter arising out of and relating to this $$$ such dispute / difference shall in the instance be resolved amicably by mutual consultation within days of the reference of disputes by either party. if amicable settlement is not reached between the parties then such unresolved dispute or difference of opinion concerning or arising from the $$$ and its implementation breach or termination whatsoever including any difference or dispute as to the interpretation of any of the terms of the $$$ shall be referred to the arbitration or a sole arbitrator appointed to gmdc and aml. the arbitrator shall give reasd award. the arbitration shall be governed by arbitration and conciliation act india and conducted in the city of ahmedabad. the language of arbitration shall be english. the parties shall share the cost of arbitration equally arbitration clause to be acceptable to the financing sources. subsequent to the signing of the above $$$ there was a board resolution of respondent dated.. the said resolution stated that the board resolved to accord its approval to the $$$ executed on.between the $$$ and the respondent subject to the modifications noted in the said resolution. subsequent to the said resolution which was communicated to the $$$ correspondence was exchanged between the $$$ and the respondent and on some occasions with the principal secretary of the state of gujarat between.and.. there was a board resolution of the respondent dated.which disclose that the board decided to the effect that in the light of the new mineral policy announced by the state government in november major changes were made in respect of bauxite also and therefore it was not inclined to extend the validity of the proposed $$$ and also decided to invite fresh eoi in bauxite for higher value addition in alumina. however in a subsequent communication dated.the respondent informed the $$$ that to maintain parity necessary modification in the terms and conditions of the $$$ dated.as approved by the board of the respondent were communicated to the state government for approval which was awaited and that on receipt of such approval a fresh $$$ may have to be executed. but subsequently by communication dated.the respondent tacitly informed the $$$ that it decided to forthwith cancel the $$$ dated.in view of failure on the part of the $$$ in complying with various terms and conditions of the $$$. the respondent thus threw the blame on the $$$ for the proposed project not being able to be finalized. in response to the said letter dated.the $$$ wrote a detailed reply on.wherein the $$$ expressed its desire to amicably resolve the dispute and requested the respondent to make an attempt for an amicable settlement as regards the issues and alleged breaches mentid in the respondent 's letter dated.. subsequently the $$$ caused a legal notice dated.to the respondent wherein it was claimed that its attempt to amicably resolve the dispute as provided under clause of the $$$ failed and therefore it decided to invoke clause of the $$$ to appoint an arbitrator and suggested the name of a retired high court judge for appointment with the concurrence of the respondent or else the $$$ 's decision to invoke section of the act. on behalf of the respondent a reply was addressed to the $$$ on.stating that there was no fault whatsoever on its side and therefore there was no question of any obligation to be fulfilled on its side and it also expressed its decision not to concur for the appointment of the arbitrator. it was in the above stated sequence of events i. from the date of $$$ to the date of filing of the application the $$$ approached the high court by filing an application under section of the act and sought for appointment of an arbitrator. by the impugned order the high court having rejected the $$$ 's application the $$$ has come forward with this appeal. we heard mr. $$$ learned senior counsel for the $$$ and mr. $$$ learned senior counsel for the respondent. mr. $$$ after referring to the above course of events that has taken place between the $$$ and the respondent from the date of $$$ dated.till the rejection of the arbitration application by the high court contended that since indisputably the respondent terminated the $$$ the conclusion of the high court that the same was a still -born was wholly unjustified. the learned senior counsel submitted that even if the $$$ for the proposed joint venture did not ultimately fructify into the creation of the joint venture clauses and of the $$$ by virtue of the specific terms contained therein would operate as stand -al agreement for arbitration and with reference to the said agreed terms since there was a consensus ad idem between the parties the high court ought to have appointed the arbitrator exercising its power under section of the act inasmuch as the respondent declined to express its consent for the named arbitrator suggested by the $$$. as against the above submission mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent vehemently submitted that the high court was able to highlight that the parties had no consensus ad idem even with reference to the very $$$ itself and in the circumstances there was no scope for applying clauses and for the appointment of arbitrator as claimed by the $$$. while mr. $$$ learned senior counsel placed reliance upon the decisions in $$$ india ltd. and ors. v. $$$ gmbh and anr. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc reva electric car co. private ltd. v. green mobil $$$ / sc/9/0$$$ / sc/9/0 scc and $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. v. ludhiana improvement trust and anr. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ scc mr. $$$ relied upon the decisions reported as sbp and co. v. patel engineering ltd. and anr. $$$ / sc/77/$$$$$$$ / sc/77/$$$$ ) scc national insurance co. ltd. v. boghara polyfab $$$. ltd. $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0 scc and chloro controls $$$. ltd. v. severn trent water purification inc. and ors. $$$ / sc/00/2$$$ / sc/00/2 scc in support of his submissions. having heard the submissions of the respective counsel we find that the sum and substance of the submission of mr. $$$ was that the arbitration clause contained in clause of the $$$ was an independent arbitration agreement and therefore even if respondent chose to terminate the $$$ dated.the arbitration agreement would continue to remain and consequently the parties are entitled to invoke the said clause and exercise their option for appointment of an arbitrator and seek for concurrence of the other party. the learned senior counsel contended that since the respondent expressed its decision to terminate the $$$ the $$$ after exhausting its attempt for an amicable settlement at bilateral level as between the $$$ and the respondent by invoking clause had no other option but to invoke clause and opt for the appointment of a retired judge $$$ mr. justice b.n. $$$ as an arbitrator and sought for the concurrence of the respondent. the learned senior counsel submitted that when the respondent refused to concur with the appointment of the said learned judge as an arbitrator the $$$ was well justified in approaching the high court under section for the appointment of an arbitrator. the learned senior counsel therefore contended that the rejection of the said application filed under section of the act by the impugned order is liable to be set aside and an arbitrator has to be appointed. according to mr. $$$ learned senior counsel for the respondent inasmuch as the $$$ itself was not a concluded contract clauses and of the said $$$ do not survive and consequently there was no scope for appointment of an arbitrator by invoking clause of the $$$. to appreciate the respective contentions and having regard to the law on this issue been already settled in more than decision we are of the view that the statement of law so declared by this court can be straightaway noted in order to render our decision in tune with the said proposition of law declared by this court. in this context we find the reliance placed upon by mr. $$$ learned senior counsel for the $$$ on the decisions in reva electrical car company private ltd. supra $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. supra and $$$ india limited supra fully support the stand of the $$$. the decision in reva electrical car company private ltd. supra was a case which arose under section of the act. a question was raised on behalf of the respondent in the said case to the effect that with the termination of the $$$ itself the arbitration clause would cease to exist. dealing with the said question the learned judge has held as under in paragraphs and. under section the legislature makes it clear that while considering any objection with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement the arbitration clause which formed part of the contract has to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. to ensure that there is no misunderstanding section ()(b further provides that even if the arbitral tribunal concludes that the contract is null and void it should not result as a matter of law in an automatic invalidation of the arbitration clause. section presumes the existence of a valid arbitration clause and mandates the same to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. by virtue of section it continues to be enforceable notwithstanding a declaration of the contract being null and void. in view of the provisions contained in section of the arbitration and conciliation act it would not be possible to accept the submission of ms. ahmadi that with the termination of the $$$ on --the arbitration clause would also cease to exist. as noticed earlier the disputes that have arisen between the parties clearly relate to the subject -matter of the relationship between the parties which came into existence through the mou. clearly therefore the disputes raised by the $$$ need to be referred to arbitration. under the arbitration clause a reference was to be made that the disputes were to be referred to a single arbitrator. since the parties have failed to appoint an arbitrator under the agreed procedure it is necessary for this court to appoint the arbitrator.emphasis added)2. in $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. supra this court approved the statement of law stated by the learned judge of this court in reva electrical car company private ltd. supra. paragraph can be usefully referred to which reads as . the same reasoning was adopted by a member of this $$$ s.s. nijjar j.while deciding reva electric car co. p ltd. v. green mobil wherein the provisions of section in the backdrop of the doctrine of kompetenz kompetenz were considered and it was inter alia held that under section the legislature makes it clear that while considering any objection with regard to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement the arbitration clause which formed part of the contract had to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. reference was made in the said judgment to the provisions of section of the act which provides that even if the arbitral tribunal concludes that the contract is null and void it should not result as a matter of law in an automatic invalidation of the arbitration clause. it was also held that section of the act presumes the existence of a valid arbitration clause and mandates the same to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. by virtue of section ()(b of the act the arbitration clause continues to be enforceable notwithstanding a declaration that the contract was null and void.emphasis added)22. again this very question came up for consideration in $$$ india limited supra to which of us f.m.i. kalifulla j.was a party. in the said decision the nature of transaction between the parties was more or less identical to the facts of this case. the contention raised on behalf of the $$$ in that case was that there can be no arbitration agreement in the absence of a concluded contract that therefore there was no question of an arbitration agreement coming into existence and therefore there was no scope for referring the dispute for arbitration. as against the above submissions it was contended on behalf of the respondent in the said decision that even if the existence of the main contract is under dispute the court is concerned only with the arbitration agreement i. the arbitration clause and that when once such a clause is very much present that would by itself result in the matter being referable for arbitration. in fact in the said case the clause relating to arbitration was found in clause no.which provided for an attempt to resolve the dispute controversy or difference through mutual consultation and if it is not resolved through mutual consultation within days after commencement of discussion then the parties may refer the dispute controversy or difference for resolution to an arbitral tribunal. dealing with the said clause and the arguments raised on behalf of the respective parties the law has been laid down as under in paragraphs and which are to the following effect:2. further the arbitration agreement contained in clauses.to.of ipla is very widely worded and would include all the disputes controversies or differences concerning the legal relationship between the parties. it would include the disputes arising in respect of the ipla with regard to its validity interpretation construction performance enforcement or its alleged breach. whilst interpreting the arbitration agreement and/or the arbitration clause the court must be conscious of the overarching policy of least intervention by courts or judicial authorities in matters covered by the indian arbitration act. in view of the aforesaid it is not possible for us to accept the submission of mr. $$$ that the arbitration agreement will perish as the ipla has not been finalised. this is also because the arbitration clause agreement is independent of the underlying contract i. the ipla containing the arbitration clause. section provides that the arbitration clause forming part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of such a contract. the concept of separability of the arbitration clause / agreement from the underlying contract is a necessity to ensure that the intention of the parties to resolve the disputes by arbitration does not evaporate into thin air with every challenge to the legality validity finality or breach of the underlying contract. the indian arbitration act as noticed above under section accepts the concept that the main contract and the arbitration agreement form independent contracts. commercial rights and obligations are contained in the underlying substantive or the main contract. it is followed by a contract which expresses the agreement and the intention of the parties to resolve the disputes relating to the underlying contract through arbitration. a remedy is elected by parties outside the normal civil court remedy. it is true that support of the national courts would be required to ensure the success of arbitration but this would not detract from the legitimacy or independence of the collateral arbitration agreement even if it is contained in a contract which is claimed to be void or voidable or unconcluded by of the parties.emphasis. mr. $$$ learned senior counsel for the respondent by referring to the judge $$$ decision of this court in patel engineering ltd. supra sought to contend that the reliance placed upon the said decision by this court in $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. supra with particular reference to the position stated in paragraph of the said judgment was not appropriate. we are not inclined to entertain the said submission as we find that we are not concerned with the said issue as to whether what was held in paragraph of $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. supra judgment was correct or not when it makes reference to the judge $$$ decision in patel engineering ltd. supra. we are only concerned with the question whether an arbitration clause contained in the mou is a stand al agreement or not. for that purpose what has been stated in $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. supra in paragraph is only relevant and we find the legal position stated therein in tune with the ratio decidendi laid down consistently by this court in very many decisions. the reliance was also placed upon the decision in national insurance company ltd. supra. paragraphs and were referred to in the said judgment. paragraph can be usefully referred which reads as under:. in sbp and co. v. patel engg. ltd.a -judge $$$ of this court considered the scope of section of the act and held that the scheme of section of the act required the chief justice or his designate to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement in terms of section of the act before exercising his power under section of the act and its implications. it was of the view that sub -sections and of section of the new act combined the power vested in the court under sections and of the old act the arbitration act. this court held scc pp. -& paras &. it is necessary to define what exactly the chief justice approached with an application under section of the act is to decide at that stage. obviously he has to decide his own jurisdiction in the sense whether the party making the motion has approached the right high court. he has to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement as defined in the act and whether the person who has made the request before him is a party to such an agreement. it is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the question whether the claim was a dead or a long -barred claim that was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties have concluded the transaction by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final payment without objection. it may not be possible at that stage to decide whether a live claim made is which comes within the purview of the arbitration clause. it will be appropriate to leave that question to be decided by the arbitral tribunal on taking evidence along with the merits of the claims involved in the arbitration. the chief justice has to decide whether the applicant has satisfied the conditions for appointing an arbitrator under section of the act. for the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects the chief justice can either proceed on the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or take such evidence or get such evidence recorded as may be necessary. we think that adoption of this procedure in the context of the act would best serve the purpose sought to be achieved by the act of expediting the process of arbitration without too many approaches to the court at various stages of the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal. the chief justice or the designated judge will have the right to decide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this judgment. these will be his own jurisdiction to entertain the request the existence of a valid arbitration agreement the existence or otherwise of a live claim the existence of the condition for the exercise of his power and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. having gone through the said paragraphs we do not find any position in law contrary to what has been stated in $$$$ homes and infrastructure $$$. ltd. supra reva electrical car company private ltd. supra and $$$ india limited supra. similarly the reliance placed upon in chloro controls $$$. ltd. supra also does not in any manner dislodge the legal position relating to the stand alone arbitration clause in a substantive transaction recorded in writing. therefore we do not find any useful purpose by referring to the said decision as well. having thus ascertained the legal position regarding the stand alone agreement relating to arbitration with particular reference to arbitration agreement in a legal transaction between the parties when we refer to clause of the mou we wish to find out whether the said clause satisfies the principles set down and applicable to a stand alone arbitration agreement. when we refer to clause we find that in the event of failure of an amicable settlement at the bilateral level relating to a dispute or difference arising between the $$$ and the respondent to be reached as contained in clause of the mou then such unresolved dispute or difference concerning or arising from the mou its implementation breach or termination whatsoever including any difference or dispute as to the interpretation of any of the terms of the mou is referable to the sole arbitrator appointed by the $$$ and the respondent. therefore irrespective of the question or as to the fact whether the mou fructified into a full -fledged agreement having regard to the non -fulfilment of any of the conditions or failure of compliance of any requirement by either of the parties stipulated in the other clauses of mou specific agreement has been entered into by the $$$ and the respondent under clause to refer such controversies as between the parties to the sole arbitrator by consensus. therefore when consensus was not reached as between the parties for making the reference eventually it will be open for either of the parties to invoke section of the act and seek for reference of the dispute for arbitration. in the case on hand as we have noted earlier after the signing of the mou on.the board of directors of the respondent passed a resolution on.which expressed its approval to the mou subject however to modification of the conditions. $$$ correspondence exchanged between the parties from.to.. there was a subsequent board resolution of the respondent on.which stated that the board took a decision that it was not inclined to extend the validity of proposed mou due to change in the mineral policy of the state government. however on.the respondent informed the $$$ that to maintain parity necessary modification in the terms and conditions of the mou dated.was communicated to the state government for approval which was awaited and that on receipt of such approval a fresh mou can be executed. $$$ by communication dated.the respondent categorically informed the $$$ that it decided to forthwith cancel the mou dated.alleging fault on the side of the $$$ with regard to failure to comply with the various terms and conditions of the mou. thus from the above referred to sequence of events which occurred between.and.it is crystal clear that both parties were at variance with reference to the various terms and conditions contained in the mou and consequently there was every right in either of the parties to seek for an amicable settlement in the instance as specified in clause of the mou. we find from the materials on record that the $$$ in its letter dated.addressed to respondent expressed its desire to amicably resolve the dispute at the bilateral level. since there was no response from the respondent the $$$ caused a legal notice on.by invoking clause of the mou for appointment of an arbitrator and also suggested the name of a retired high court judge and sought for the concurrence of the respondent. in the legal notice the $$$ specifically intimated that in the event of the respondent failing to express its concurrence for the appointment of the named arbitrator it will have no other option but to move the high court under section of the act. the respondent having made it clear in its reply dated.to the lawyer 's notice stating that it was not inclined to agree for a reference the $$$ had no other option except to move the high court by filing an application under section of the act. having noted the above factors and inasmuch as we are convinced that clause is a valid arbitration agreement contained in the mou dated.the $$$ was fully entitled to invoke the said agreement and seek for a reference to the arbitrator. in the light of our above conclusion we hold that the learned judge having failed to appreciate the legal position as regards the existence of an arbitration agreement in the mou irrespective of the failure of the parties to reach a full -fledged agreement with respect to the various terms and conditions contained in the mou for a joint venture the said conclusion and judgment of the learned judge is liable to be set aside and is accordingly set aside. since the respondent has expressed its disinclination to agree to express its concurrence and thereby the parties failed to appoint an arbitrator under the agreed procedure it is necessary for this court to appoint an arbitrator. therefore while setting aside the judgment impugned in this appeal we hereby appoint hon'ble ms. justice rekha $$$ resident of c-5 deo sangam flat guartgam road $$$ gujarat former chief justice of patna high court and former judge of gujarat high court as the sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes that have arisen between the parties on such terms and conditions as the sole arbitrator deems fit and proper. undoubtedly the learned sole arbitrator shall decide all the disputes arising between the parties under the mou without being influenced by any prima facie opinion expressed in this order with regard to the respective claims of the parties. the registry is directed to communicate this order to the sole arbitrator to enable him to enter upon the reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as possible. the appeal stands allowed with the above directions.
