. on.after referring to the earlier order dated.and various other aspects this court has expressed the following view.we will be failing in our duty if we do not make a note of the submissions of both the sides which are extreme in nature for example emphasis and stress have been laid that due to stray dogs there has been threat to life health movement and sometimes security of the human beings. on the other hand it has been highlighted that the stray dogs are being annihilated without any justifiable reason. as advised at present we do not intend to say anything on the said counts $$$$. on the last occasion we had asked the chief secretary of each of the states and competent authorities of the union territories to act in letter and spirit of the previous order. as has been indicated earlier

the board shall see to it that the problem is sorted out.we will be failing in our duty if we do not note the submission of mr. dushyant a. $$$ that though the act and rules provide for sterilization of dogs so that safety of the human beings is not jeopardized yet they are not being sterilized by the authorities either for lack of funds or due to apathy. $$$ being had to the provisions governing

be prepared by the board be given to the learned counsel for the parties.in pursuance of the aforesaid order the animal welfare board has filed a module which takes note of various aspects. aspect pertains to implementation framework for street dog population management rabies eradication and reducing man -dog conflict. we think it appropriate to reproduce the same for the sake of completeness and so also to have future assistance. therefore it is reproduced hereunder the animal birth control dogs rules prescribe the methodology for street dog population management ensuring rabies eradication and reduction in man -dog conflict based on scientific studies and recommendations of the world health organisation. however the implementation of the rules in most states has been observed to be inadequate haphazard and poorly planned. the desired results have therefore not been achieved in such cases.the reasons for poor implementation have been cited to be lack of required coordination between the centre and the state governments and between local authorities implementation agencies and other stake -holders within the states. most states have not created any budget head for animal birth control of street dogs. the grant given by the central government has always been inadequate and has reduced even further in $$$$ to become negligible. successfully conducting a viable animal birth control programme throughout the country is not possible in these circumstances. the shortage of resources has also led to huge cruelties being inflicted on the animals and in increased conflict. in order to implement the animal birth control dogs rules in letter and spirit a water -tight implementation framework needs to be laid down and monitored by the central government and the hon'ble supreme court of india from time to time.step i creation of a central coordination committee it is recommended that a central coordination committee for street dog population control be set up to ensure seamless coordination between different stakeholders at the centre and between the centre and the state governments. this will also help in clarifying the role that each stake -holder must play to ensure the successful conduct of the programme. proposed structure of the central coordination committee chairperson the secretary ministry of environment forest and climate

throughput abc programmes where infrastructure is to be created by the state governments and the fund for implementation of the programme will thereafter be provided by the central government on a per dog basis.to ensure that each state government creates a budget head for setting up infrastructure i. abc facilities / campuses and provisioning for ambulances for transportation of dogs in the state.to set up a protocol for disbursal of funds to state governments whereby the programme can be implemented in a phase -wise seamless manner in each state keeping in mind that rotating funds / buffer funds must also be provisioned for so that there is no hitch in the conduct of the programme on account of interrupted funding.to determine the rate at which the abc implementing agencies will be reimbursed for expenses incurred for abc surgeries in each state and to set mutually agreed upon targets for infrastructure creation and the number of surgeries to be conducted in each state in a detailed phasewise manner. this rate shall be revised $$$$.to ensure that each state sets up a state monitoring and implementation committee for animal birth control and review the performance and processes of each such committee and give recommendations for effective implementation of the animal birth control dogs rules.vii to submit $$$$ progress reports to the hon'ble supreme court regarding the progress of the abc programme in each state.step creation of the state monitoring and implementation committeesit is recommended that a state monitoring and implementation committee be set up at the state / union territory level in all states and union territories across the country. proposed constitution of the state monitoring and implementation committees chairperson the secretary in

and experience and are duly recognized by the animal welfare board of india. this may include the animal husbandry department of the state working in consultation with and the under the technical guidance of the awbi or animal welfare organisations recognized by the awbiiv where adequate abc implementing agencies are not available the state monitoring and implementation committee shall set up a special purpose vehicle spv within the state animal husbandry department to act as the abc implementing agency. in each such case the abc implementing agency will undergo training at an awbi designated training establishment and embark upon the program only once the training has been completed.ensuring that the requisite infrastructure is set up and other capital costs including but not limited to fully furnished abc facilities / campuses with ambulances and equipment and all other expenses for successfully running an animal birth control program including manpower costs are made available to the abc implementing agencies from the local authorities and reimbursed in a timely manner as required by rule of the animal birth control dogs rules.step establishment of animal birth control monitoring committeesthe establishment of animal birth control monitoring committees at local authority levels in accordance with animal birth control dogs rules is indispensable for the success of the animal birth control program. the constitution of the monitoring committee is provided for in rule of the rules and the functions that it is required to perform are provided for in

detailed project reports shall have to be prepared and submitted to the state monitoring and implementation committee and coordination established with the state government through the said committee.

taken up. the infrastructure shall include but not be limited to pre -operation preparation areas operation theaters post -op care kennels kitchen store rooms for rations and medicines parking area residential rooms for veterinarians and attendants quarantine wards ambulances etc.step iv identification of abc implementing agenciesthe practice of tendering i. inviting bids from interested abc ' contractors ' and awarding abc ' contracts to the lowest bidder being followed by many local authorities has more often than not led to violations of the rules and the act. for instance the lowest bidder may not be an organisation recognised by the awbi which is a mandatory requirement under the animal birth control dogs rules. furthermore it has been widely observed that many competitive lowest bidders disregard best practices necessary to ensure the welfare of animals in their care and fail to adhere to other essential requirements under the rules in order to find profit margins within the lowest price. this in turn leads to significant pain and suffering being caused to the animals and the success of the program being adversely impacted and jeopardized.this module prescribes that the rate of sterilization per dog shall be fixed and reviewed $$$$ by the central coordination committee thereby ensuring uniformity. once this is done an expression of interest may be sought with technical bid as sole criterion for selection of abc implementing agencies for execution of the animal birth control program. needless to state the agency short -listed for implementation must be thoroughly trained and recognized by the awbi. the local authorities whilst calling for an expression of interest will ensure that the abc implementing agencies entrusted with execution of the animal birth control program have an adequate number of trained veterinarians para -vets catchers and drivers. the staff of the abc implementing agency should have obtained training from an awbi recognised training establishment.the abc implementing agency must have been in existence for a minimum of years. a memorandum of understanding shall be executed between the abc implementing agency and either
