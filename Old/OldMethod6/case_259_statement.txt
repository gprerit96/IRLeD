in our opinion was due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of injury to the vital organs which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. all the injuries were ante -mortem in

committed in connivance with $$$ @ mintu $$$ malkiat singh $$$ and $$$ @ bhatti. it appears that despite such clear assertions no arrests were effected. the matter was being investigated by pw sub

months before $$$ and $$$ had taken him and pw $$$ to the dhaba of pahlwan in a tempo. they were told to give beating to pw sukhwinder singh as he had contracted marriage with a girl related to $$$ without the consent of her family. said pw $$$ and pw $$$ not having agreed to they left the dhaba. later in the newspaper he saw the photograph of pw sukhwinder singh and his wife and therefore had

submit his specimen hand -writing. after completion of investigation charge -sheet was filed against persons while $$$ maternal uncle and malkiat kaur mother of jassi were declared proclaimed offenders. it was the case of the prosecution that the accused had hatched the conspiracy to commit the murder of jassi and had caused injuries to pw- sukhwinder singh and thus committed the offences with which they were charged. it was alleged that the marriage of jassi with pw sukhwinder singh who was simply a wheeler driver was not to the liking of the mother and the maternal uncle of jassi. the prosecution in support of its case examined witnesses and produced number of documents on record while witnesses were examined in defence. the gist of the testimony of the witnesses examined by the prosecution inter alia was as under pw-3 dr. $$$ who was of the doctors conducting the post -mortem on the body of jassi stated about her injuries and the cause of death and that kirpan ext. p-12 recovered pursuant to disclosure statement could have caused those injuries.pw-1 dr. amit modi dr. $$$ and pw- dr. subhasis das deposed about the injuries of pw- sukhwinder singh and the treatment given to him by them.pw-5 $$$ and $$$ stated about their meeting with $$$ and $$$ at the dhaba of a pahlwan and that they did not agree to the proposal of beating pw- sukhwinder singh. they identified the tempo and stated about having given statements under section code of criminal procedure. $$$ deposed that $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ were his friends that they had met at a farm on.when $$$ had asked him whether he had read newspaper of $$$$. he further deposed that $$$ stated that they had committed the murder of jassi that $$$ was with them and that the money was paid through said $$$. he stated about having given a statement under section code of criminal procedure.pw-8 $$$ deposed that his tempo pb-/9 was impounded by cia staff of which $$$ was in -charge and that the tempo was released on.after he had paid money as demanded. this version was corroborated by $$$.pw- barjinder singh stated that on.he saw a car of white colour with persons standing close by. later he heard the voice of a woman asking for help and that those persons had forcibly taken her away. though he failed to identify the persons his version supported the case as regards the location and the time of incident.vii pw- sukhwinder singh deposed that he was married with jassi on.that it was against the wishes of her parents that malkiat kaur and $$$ viz. mother and maternal uncle of jassi used to give him threats and stated how the incident occurred on.. he had shown his willingness and capacity to identify the assailants and did identify $$$ and $$$ in court.viii pw- $$$ uncle of who had taken him to the hospital supported the version of .ix pw- b.s. deol judicial magistrate spoke about the refusal on part of $$$ and $$$ to participate in test identification parade and refusal by $$$ to give his specimen handwriting.pw-2 constable $$$ deposed about the recoveries effected from bolara farm pursuant to the disclosure statement of the accused.pw-2 charan preet singh stated that he knew $$$ and $$$ and that they used to call from their telephone numbers.pw-32 $$$ deposed that at the request of adgp punjab intelligence his company had supplied copies of print outs of telephone nos. and. pw-3 $$$ produced the record pertaining to telephone no. installed in the name of $$$.pw-3 $$$ deposed about the fir no. dated.which was registered pursuant to fax message ext. pao and that he had recorded the statement of jassi. he further stated about the statement of jassi under section code of criminal procedure and that he had recommended cancellation after having found the case to be false.pw-38 si hardeep singh spoke about the registration of fir in the present case and the investigation conducted by him till it was handed over to pw-1 inspector $$$ who in turn deposed about various stages of investigation including the arrests of the accused disclosure statements made by the accused and the recoveries made pursuant thereto and various other aspects. the trial court after considering the material on record and hearing rival submissions vide its judgment dated.found that the prosecution had successfully proved its case against accused persons including the appellants. it found them guilty under section read with section 1b indian penal code. accused $$$ $$$ @ ashu $$$ @ ginder and gursharan singh @ $$$ were sentenced under section indian penal code to undergo life imprisonment under section indian penal code to undergo ri for years and under section indian penal code to undergo ri for years with separate sentences of fine and sentences in default. other accused namely $$$ $$$ and $$$ were convicted with the aid of section 1b indian penal code and sentenced to suffer similar imprisonment on the aforesaid counts. however benefit of doubt was given to other accused namely $$$ @ soni ravinder singh @ lilu kamaljeet singh @ komal and $$$ @ bhatti and they were acquitted of all the charges. all convicted accused filed $$$. and before the high court which gave benefit of doubt to $$$ $$$ and gursharan singh @ $$$ and acquitted them while it confirmed the conviction and sentence of the present appellants which judgment is now under challenge in the present appeals. as regards appellants $$$ and $$$ the trial court as well as the high court have principally relied upon the evidence regarding assault on pw- sukhwinder singh as stated by him and the fact that he identified them to be part of the group of assailants. the extra judicial confession as stated by $$$ and the recoveries effected pursuant to the disclosure statements were relied upon. the testimony of pw-5 $$$ and $$$ as well as the communications between the accused soon before and after the incident of assault on pw- sukhwinder singh and kidnapping of jassi were also relied upon. the other appellants were found guilty with the aid of section 1b indian penal code as conspirators. the telephonic communications between them and $$$ and $$$ were relied upon as against $$$ and $$$. $$$ for $$$ and $$$ mr. r.k. kapoor learned advocate submitted that identification by for the time in court could not be taken as conclusive evidence. the evidence in the form of extra judicial confession was also not conclusive inasmuch as certain other accused though named in such confession were acquitted by the courts below. $$$.t.s. $$$ learned senior advocate appearing for $$$ submitted that in a subsequent trial initiated against $$$ on the allegation of demand of bribe for releasing the same tempo bearing no. pb-/9 he was honourably acquitted and as such said judgment would operate as issue estoppel. $$$. $$$ learned senior advocate appearing for $$$ submitted that the landline telephone number in question stated to be that of $$$ was actually in the name of his brother installed at the residence of said brother and there was no evidence to suggest that it was exclusively under the control of $$$. in any case daughter of $$$ was married to the son of surjeet singh maternal uncle of jassi and as such calls from the said landline number to the number in canada were completely justified and no inference could be drawn that said $$$ was of the conspirators. $$$ for state of punjab shri jayant k. sud additional advocate general assisted by ms. $$$ assistant advocate general took us through the entire record. it was submitted that the offence in the present case was an act of conspiracy which was clear from the fact that fax message ext. pao had originated from the same number in canada with which the accused $$$ @ ashu and $$$ were constantly in touch that the backside of the photograph ext. p-38 and the conversations deposed to by pw-5 $$$ and harjeet singh lend complete corroboration that identification by was completely trustworthy and fully reliable that the record of telephonic conversations show all the appellants were in touch with each other as well as with the number in canada soon before and immediately after the occurrence that the recoveries of kirpan bloodstained seat cover and photograph ext. p-38 corroborated the prosecution case and that the extra judicial confession as stated by $$$ further clinched the issue. the evidence of pw- sukhwinder singh regarding the occurrence that took place on.is fully supported by the medical evidence on record. he was immediately taken for medical attention and found to have suffered injuries some of which were by sharp cutting weapon. his assertion regarding the place of incident and the manner in which the occurrence took place is also supported by another witness pw-1 $$$. though said witness failed to identify the assailants as he had watched the incident from a distance he lends complete support to pw- as regards other material particulars. considering the nature of injuries suffered by him and the fact that jassi was forcibly taken by the assailants the entire incident could certainly have afforded sufficient time and opportunity to pw- to recollect and identify the assailants. the law on the point is well -settled that if the witness is trustworthy and reliable the mere fact that no test identification parade was conducted would not be a reason to discard the evidence of the witness. it was observed by this court in $$$ v. state of $$$ / $$$ / sc/0168/$$$$ scc as under: the abovementioned decisions would indicate that while the evidence of identification of an accused at a trial is admissible as substantive piece of evidence it would depend on the facts of a given case as to whether or not such a piece of evidence can be relied upon as the sole basis of conviction of an accused. in malkhansingh v. state of m.p.this court clarified that the test identification parade is not a substantive piece of evidence and to hold the test identification parade is not even the rule of law but a rule of prudence so that the identification of accused inside the courtroom at the trial can be safely relied upon. we are of the view that if the witnesses are trustworthy and reliable the mere fact that no test identification parade was conducted itself would not be a reason for discarding the evidence of those witnesses... the prosecution had made the witness available for test identification but the concerned accused had refused to participate in the test. though there was no reason for such refusal and adverse inference could be drawn against the accused we still looked for other corroborating material which is available in the form of extra judicial confession as deposed to by $$$ and the incident which had happened at the dhaba of pahlwan as spoken by pw-5 $$$ and harjeet singh. the fact that a photograph of jassi ext. p-38 was recovered pursuant to disclosure statement by $$$ is another circumstance. that photograph ext. p-38 was recovered from bolara farm which was under the control of $$$. the description of jassi in $$$ on the back side of the photograph is crucial. $$$ on part of $$$ to give his specimen hand writing must lead to adverse inference against him. the recovery of weapon namely kirpan which according to the doctor could have resulted in the injuries suffered by pw- sukhwinder singh and jassi and the blood -stained seat cover are other circumstances lending complete corroboration. the communication by $$$ and $$$ with the number in canada which itself was the source for the fax -message ext. pao is another circumstance. all these circumstances stand proved and clearly point in the direction of the guilt of $$$ and $$$ and additionally lend complete support to the testimony of and identification by pw sukhwinder singh. the courts below were therefore perfectly justified in finding $$$ and $$$ guilty of the offences under sections and indian penal code. we now deal with the case of the other appellants. the submission advanced by $$$ that the subsequent judgment will operate as issue estoppel is not correct. first and foremost the offences are different and distinct. the rule regarding issue estoppel relates to admissibility of evidence in subsequent proceedings which is designed to up -set a finding of fact recorded on the previous occasion and mandates that the finding so rendered on earlier occasion must operate as issue estoppel in subsequent proceedings. it makes it impermissible to lead any such evidence at a subsequent stage or occasion. the attempt on part of mr. $$$ is just the opposite. he seeks to rely on the finding at a subsequent stage to up -set a finding of fact recorded on a previous occasion. the law on the point was succinctly stated by this court in sangeetaben mahendrabhai patel v. state of gujarat manu / sc/03/$$$$manu / sc/03/$$$$ scc in following words:23. this court has time and again explained the principle of issue estoppel in a criminal trial observing that where an issue of fact has been tried by a competent court on an earlier occasion and a finding has been recorded in favour of the accused such a finding would constitute an estoppel or res judicata against the prosecution not as a bar to the trial and conviction of the accused for a different or distinct offence but as precluding the acceptance / reception of evidence to disturb the finding of fact when the accused is tried subsequently for a different offence. this rule is distinct from the doctrine of double jeopardy as it does not prevent the trial of any offence but only precludes the evidence being led to prove a fact in issue as regards which evidence has already been led and a specific finding has been recorded at an earlier criminal trial. thus the rule relates only to the admissibility of evidence which is designed to upset a finding of fact recorded by a competent court in a previous trial on a factual issue..we therefore reject the submission. as per deposition of pw-8 $$$ and other material on record the tempo in question bearing no. pb-10/9719 was under the control of $$$. it was this tempo which was used by $$$ as stated by pw-5 $$$ and pw harjeet singh. the telephonic conversations between $$$ a serving police officer and $$$ and $$$ just before and soon after the incident are extremely crucial. no explanation has been offered on part of $$$. the record further indicates that $$$ was also in touch with the same number from canada in respect of which again there is no explanation. in the extra judicial confession deposed to by there is clear assertion that parents of jassi had given money through $$$. in the circumstances we fully agree with the assessment made by the courts below in finding $$$ guilty of the offences under sections and indian penal code with the aid of section 120b indian penal code. his conviction and sentence in our considered view is completely justified. however as regards $$$ all that the prosecution has produced is the record of telephonic conversations. no doubt that there have been communications with $$$ $$$ $$$ and the number from canada but such communications are from a landline number which stands in the name of the brother of $$$. there is no evidence on record that the said landline number was under the exclusive control of $$$. secondly given the fact that his daughter is married with the son of surjeet singh from canada the conversations with the number in canada are explainable. it is true that suspicion against $$$ was expressly stated in the statement of pw-15 sukhwinder singh itself. however apart from telephonic conversations nothing has been placed on record by the prosecution. we therefore give benefit of doubt to $$$ and acquit him of the charges leveled against him. in the circumstances criminal appeal nos. -of preferred by $$$ @ ashu and $$$ and criminal appeal no. of by $$$ are dismissed affirming the orders of conviction and sentence recorded against them. the appeal of $$$ namely crl. appeal no. of is allowed and he is acquitted of all the charges. the bail bonds furnished by him stand cancelled. $$$ @ ashu $$$ and $$$ who were not granted bail must undergo the sentences awarded.
