$$$ j. leave granted. aggrieved by the order dated.of the order of the high court of madhya pradesh in la. no. of in election petition no. of the unsuccessful applicant therein preferred the instant appeal. the $$$ herein is the returned candidate from -churhat assembly constituency of the state of madhya pradesh in the general elections held in the year. he was a candidate sponsored by the indian national congress party and won by margin of votes. challenging the legality of the election of the $$$ the first respondent herein of the other candidates at the said election filed election petition no. of. the $$$ herein filed i.a. no. of invoking order vi rule of the code of civil procedure cpc praying various paragraphs of the election petition be struck off on the ground that the allegations contained in those paragraphs are frivolous and vexatious etc. by the order impugned in this appeal the said i.a. was dismissed. hence the instant appeal. before we examine the various questions that arise in this appeal we think it profitable to examine the scheme of order vi rule. striking out pleadings -the court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any pleading-(a which may be unnecessary scandalous frivolous or vexatious or(b which may tend to prejudice embarrass or delay the fair trial of the suit or(c which is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.it authorises the court to order that any matter in any pleading before it be struck out on the grounds specified under $$$ a and c. each of them is a distinct ground. for example clause a authorises the court to strike out the pleadings which may be unnecessary scandalous frivolous vexatious. if a pleading or part of it is to be struck out on the ground that it is unnecessary the test to be applied is whether the allegation contained in that pleading is relevant and essential to grant the relief sought. allegations which are unconnected with the relief sought in the proceeding fall under this category. similarly if a pleading is to be struck out on the ground that it is scandalous the court must first record its satisfaction that the pleading is scandalous in the legal sense and then enquire whether such scandalous allegation is called for or necessary having regard to the nature of the relief sought in the proceeding. the authority of the court under clause c is much wider. obviously such authority must be exercised with circumspection and on the basis of some rational principles. the very purpose of the rule is to ensure that parties to a legal proceeding are entitled debito justitia to have the case against them presented in an intelligible form so that they may not be embarrassed in meeting the case. in the context of the application of order vi rule code of civil procedure to the election petition this court in $$$ and anr. v. $$$ and ors. air sc held that a court examining an election petition may order striking out of charges which are vague. in ponnala lakshmaiah v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/05/$$$$$$$ / sc/05/$$$$ scc this court considered the scope of an application under order vii rule code of civil procedure. such an application was filed by the returned candidate praying that the election petition be dismissed for non -disclosure of any cause of action. this court opined that for the purpose of determining such an application the averments in the election petition must be taken to be factually correct and thereafter examine whether such averments furnish the cause of action for granting the relief to the petitir. such a conclusion was recorded on the basis of the law laid down in an earlier judgment of this court4. we are of the opinion the same principles of law are applicable even while adjudicating the application under order vi rule. in the light of the above principles of law we proceed to examine the case on hand. the election of the $$$ is challenged on the ground of commission of various corrupt practices falling under section and of the representation of the people act hereinafter referred to as the act"):. corrupt practices.--the following shall be deemed to be corrupt practices for the purposes of this act:( bribery that is to say--(a any gift offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent of any gratification to any person whomsoever with the object directly or indirectly of inducing--(a a person to stand or not to stand as or to withdraw or not to withdraw from being a candidate at an election or(b an elector to vote or refrain from voting at an election or as a reward $$$ a person for having so stood or not stood or for having withdrawn or not having withdrawn his candidature an elector for having voted or refrained from voting;(b the receipt of or agreement to receive any gratification whether as a motive or a reward--(a by a person for standing or not standing as or for withdrawing or not withdrawing from being a candidate or(b by any person whomsoever for himself or any other person for voting or refraining from voting or inducing or attempting to induce any elector to vote or refrain from voting or any candidate to withdraw or not to withdraw his candidature.the appeal by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion race caste community or language or the use of or appeal to religious symbols or the use of or appeal to national symbols such as the national flag or the national emblem for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate provided that no symbol allotted under this act to a candidate shall be deemed to be a religious symbol or a national symbol for the purposes of this clause.the incurring or authorizing of expenditure in contravention of section.i. bribery soliciting votes on the ground of religion and incurring of expenditure in contravention of section of the act. the allegations regarding the commission of corrupt practices falling under section are to be found in para of the election petition. the allegations regarding commission of corrupt practices falling under section are contained in paragraph of the election petition which is not of the paragraphs which was prayed to be struck off5. all the remaining paragraphs which were prayed to be struck off pertain to the allegation of corrupt practice falling under section. the allegations contained in each of these paragraphs pertain to the expenditure incurred under different heads by the $$$ in connection with the election campaign. according to the respondent the total amount of expenditure so incurred by the $$$ is in excess of the limit prescribed under section of the act. the allegations contained in para of the election petition are not disputed by the $$$. on the other hand he chose to explain his conduct in para of the i.a. the answering respondent hereby respectfully submits that an amount of rs. lacs is earmarked for expenditure by every member of the m.p. legislative assembly $$$$ in his constituency. a minister and leader of opposition are provided rs. lacs per year for voluntary grant. the manner in which this grant is to be distributed is the sole discretion of such minister / leader of opposition. the minister / leader of opposition gives a list to the secretary of the vidhan sabha containing the names of the persons and the amount to whom the grant is to be made. accordingly the drafts are issued to the persons concerned as per procedure. whether the explanation is factually correct and if so what are the legal implications of the said explanation are matters to be decided in trial of the election petition. if the explanation is either found to be untrue or legally unacceptable the allegation made in para of the election petition is sufficient to hold that the $$$ is guilty of the corrupt practice under section. therefore we do not find any error in the order of the high court in refusing to strike off the pleadings in para of the election petition. we now examine the validity of the impugned order insofar as it pertains to the incurring of expenditure by the $$$ herein beyond the permissible limits prescribed by law. an analysis of the allegations contained in various sub -paragraphs of paragraph and in paragraphs and of the election petition indicates that the excess expenditure said to have been incurred by the $$$ falls under heads.furnishing of inaccurate information to the district election officer:(i regarding the quantity and quality of the material used in the campaign by the $$$ herein,(ii regarding the cost of the various items so used by the returned candidate by giving false information based on deliberate under -valuation of the material actually used by the $$$,(iii total non disclosure of certain expenditure incurred by the $$$ for a organizing a meeting of of the top functionaries of the political party $$$ which sponsored the $$$ at the election and the use of a helicopter by the $$$ during the relevant period. the allegations and counter allegations regarding the quantity and quality of the material used by the $$$ during the course of his election campaign and value of such material are pure questions of fact which are required to be established on evidence. the law in this regard as already noticed is that until proved otherwise the allegations in the election petition must be presumed to be true. the burden of establishing the truth of all those allegations is essentially on the respondent / election petitir. we have meticulously g through the various allegations in this regard contained in various sub -paragraphs of paragraph and we are of the opinion that there is nothing which warrants striking out of all those pleadings invoking order vi rule code of civil procedure. each of the paragraphs contains allegations that the $$$ incurred some expenditure specified under some head or the other. the sum total of such amount would exceed the permissible limits of expenditure under section of the act. the only question which deserves our attention in this regard is that it is the case of the $$$ that under the procedure that is being followed by the election commission a rate list has been finalized with respect to each of the items to be utilized in the campaign by any of the candidates at an election. the $$$ 's declaration of his expenditure with regard to the various items used during the process of campaign is consistent with such determination made by the election commission. therefore there can not be any further enquiry regarding the correctness of the declaration made by him about the expenditure incurred in connection with those materials. the $$$ 's pleading in this regard in i.a. is as follows:5. that under rule of conduct of elections rules the maximum election expenses to be incurred by a candidate in respect of m.p. state legislative assembly election has been fixed at rs. lacs. in order to have a check over the limit of election expenses the collector / district election officer prepared a rate list of various items which were sought to be used in the election campaign by appointing a sub committee of responsible officers. the committee pursuant thereto ascertained the rates of such material from open market in consultation with the representatives of major political parties and thereafter prepared a final rate list of various items used in the election. the answering respondent is filing copy of proceedings of the collector / district election officer fixing the rates of different items used in the election as document no. the petitir has filed a copy of rate list as annexure -p-. the publication of rate list preceded the proceedings held in that behalf by the district election officer which the answering respondent has now filed as document no. the rate list so prepared by the election officer has not been disputed by any of the political party or their representatives. that certain items which could not find place in the rate list so prepared by the collector have since been included in the shadow register of each candidate prepared by the election expense observers. such rate list and the shadow register are final and conclusive. the rate list and the shadow register are not open to challenge and the valuation in respect of such items can not be reassessed and revalued by this court in an election process. that the present election petition will not be maintainable in respect of expenses incurred by the answering respondent which have been accepted by the district election officer for short deo inasmuch as this court will not sit over rate list or shadow register to give its own valuation of the election material as the same would be beyond the scope of trial of election petition under the representation of people act of hereinafter referred to as the act. on the other hand it is the case of the respondent that the determination made by the election commission is not conclusive of the prices of the material used by any candidate at the election. apart from that the actual quantity of the campaign material used by any candidate at an election and its cost is always a question of fact. after an election is concluded it is always open to any election petitir to demonstrate in an election petition that the campaign material used by the returned candidate is more expensive than what was determined by the election commission after all the value of the material depends both upon the quality and quantity of the material used. all these are questions of fact which are required to be examined and determined by the court in an election petition. we accept the submission of the election petitir. the values fixed by the election commission or its functionaries are not conclusive. there is no statutory basis for such an exercise. the valuation made by the election commission obviously would be based on the samples supplied by the candidates. there can never be any presumption that the candidates used the same quality of material in the actual process of campaigning. apart from that the quantity and the quality of the material used in the election campaign and the real cost of the material actually used by any candidate are always questions of fact which are required to be established in evidence. we are of the opinion that the high court rightly rejected the application of the $$$ on this count. the only major issue which requires an examination is regarding the head mentid para above. it is once again required to be divided into sub -headings,(a the expenditure allegedly incurred in connection with the public meeting of $$$ at the district headquarters $$$ on th november. the allegations in the regard are to be found in para of the election petition.the substance of the allegation is that though the meeting was held at $$$ which is beyond the territorial limits of churhat constituency from which the parties herein contested the $$$ was not only present at such meeting but also shared the dais with $$$ vice -chairman of the indian national congress. the $$$ mobilized lot of voters from his constituency and hired vehicles for that purpose incurring expenditure. the $$$ also incurred expenditure in connection with the erection of the pandals security arrangement etc. according to the respondent such expenditure would be rs. and the same is required to be added to the election expenditure of the $$$.that the $$$ between.to.traveled on occasions by chartered flights between bhopal to $$$. according to the respondent on this court al the $$$ incurred an expenditure of rs. lakhs. the details of such flights and the allegations are to be found at para of the election petition. the response of the $$$ as disclosed by ia no. of with regard to the abovementid allegations is found at paragraph nos. and. it can be seen therefrom that the $$$ does not dispute that there was a public meeting in the grounds of sanjay gandhi college at $$$ on.attended by $$$. according to the $$$ the venue of the meeting is within the territorial limits of $$$ assembly constituency but not within the territory of $$$$-churhat assembly constituency. the meeting was organized by $$$ who was the candidate of the indian national congress party contesting from the said constituency. the said $$$ lodged the account under section of the act disclosing the details of the expenditure incurred by him for conducting the aforesaid meeting which was duly accepted by the returning officer of -$$$ assembly constituency. it is the specific plea of the $$$ that he was present in the said meeting because he was also of the star campaigners for the indian national congress party in the said election. according to the $$$ the $$$ is under no legal obligation to account for the expenditure incurred for organizing the said meeting0. it is significant to notice that there is no specific denial by the $$$ of the allegation in the election petition that the $$$ herein had hired a large number of vehicles to facilitate voters from his constituency to attend the said public meeting. ia no. of is absolutely silent regarding that allegation. the $$$ does not even deny the allegation. we must not be understood to be holding that if the $$$ had denied the allegation such denial would suffice to strike out of the pleadings. coming to the limb of that head regarding the cost incurred for the construction of pandals or barricades in connection with the abovementid meeting of $$$ the stand taken by the $$$ in the abovementid ia is that the said meeting was held beyond the territorial limit of the assembly constituency from which the $$$ contested. the indian national congress party 's candidate contesting from $$$ constituency had declared the expenditure incurred in connection with the said meeting. the $$$ is under no legal obligation to make any declaration of the expenditure incurred by him in connection with the said meeting. it may be noted that the $$$ does not make any categoric assertion that he did not incur any expenditure in connection with the said meeting. coming to the use of the $$$ once again it is not a case of the $$$ that he did not use the helicopter as alleged by the respondent -election $$$. his defence is that he is of the star campaigners ' contemplated under section of the act. the expenditure was incurred by him for the use of the $$$ as a star campaigner. in that capacity he had to travel throughout the state holding public meetings propagating programme of the indian national congress party. the expenditure for the use of the helicopter was borne by the indian national congress and therefore outside the purview of the election expenditure of the $$$. the relevant portion of the pleading at para of the ia no. of reads as follows in this view of the mater the expenses so incurred in the use of helicopter has since been borne by the indian national congress new delhi and the same is outside the purview of election expense so far as the answering respondent is concerned by virtue of $$$ to section referred to above. it is however further added that the answering respondent besides being a star campaigner was also a leader of opposition in the last m.p. state legislative assembly. the answering respondent is otherwise a veteran leader of the indian national congress party and on account of his capacity as such he was appointed as $$$ and has traveled throughout the state holding public meetings propagating programme of the indian national congress party. the expenditure so incurred in use of helicopter in propagating the programme of the party throughout the state can not be included in the election expense of the answering respondent in respect of his election from $$$. it is further made clear that he never used helicopter for his election campaign in $$$. thus in view of explanation to section of the act the entire pleadings contained in paragraph are liable to be struck off being absolutely vexatious and frivolous providing no cause of action for trial of election petition.emphasis. section of the act obligates every candidate in an election to keep a separate current account of all expenditures in connection with the election between the dates on which such a candidate has been nominated and the date of the declaration of result of that election. however clause a of explanation to section of the act declares the expenditure incurred by leaders of a political party on account of travel by air or by any other means of transport for propagating programme of the political party shall not form part of the expenditure of the candidate. the expression leaders of political party occurring in explanation is itself explained in explanation to the said section.explanation.the purpose of clause a of explanation the expression leaders of a political party in respect of any election means,--(i where such political party is a recognised political party such persons not exceeding in number $$$ where such political party is other than a recognised political party such persons not exceeding in number whose names have been communicated to the election commission and the chief electoral officers of the states by the political party to be leaders for the purposes of such election within $$$$ days from the date of the notification for such election published in the gazette of india or official gazette of the state as the case may be under this act. it can be seen from explanation to qualify to be called a leader of the political party for the purpose of such an election under section the name of such a person is communicated to the election commission and the chief electoral officer of the state by the concerned political party. such a communication is required to be made within $$$$ days from the notification of such election published in the gazette of india etc. persons whose names have been so communicated to the election commission popularly came to be called star campaigners in connection with an election. it is the admitted case of the parties before us that both $$$ and the $$$ are star campaigners / leaders of the indian national congress party for the election in question. however the entire expenditure incurred on whatsoever count by such star campaigners or on behalf of such star campaigners is not exempted under section for the purpose of determining the total expenditure incurred by any candidate in an election. the language of explanation to section makes it clear that only the expenditure incurred by the star campaigner that too on account of travel for propagating the programme of the political party is excluded for the purpose of computing the expenditure incurred by the candidate. in other words the expenditure incurred in connection with arrangements like erection of pandals etc. for a meeting of a star campaigner does not form part of the exempted expenditure under explanation. secondly under explanation ii the star campaigners ' travel expenditure must have been incurred by the star campaigner himself. it is obvious from the opening clause of explanation the expenditure incurred by leaders of a political party. if such expenditure is incurred by any person other than the star campaigner different considerations would arise. the application i. ia no. of does not disclose on which of the grounds contemplated under order vi rule the various paragraphs of the election petition are required to be struck out. on the other hand the $$$ gave an elaborate explanation with respect to each of the allegations contained in the various paragraphs of the election petition which are prayed to be struck out. the moment court is asked to examine the defence of the returned candidate in an election petition the election petition can neither be dismissed for want of cause of action nor any part of the pleading can be struck out under order vi rule. in the absence of the availability of any of the grounds mentid in order vi rule code of civil procedure striking out is impermissible. as observed by this court in the context of the application under order vii rule the averments contained in the election petition at this stage must be presumed to be factually correct. the only possible scrutiny of such statement is whether those allegations are relevant in the context of the relief sought in the election petition. n of the allegations contained in the various sub paragraphs of paragraph except paragraph m can be said to be irrelevant in the context of the prayer in the election petition. the specific pleading in the election petition at paragraph m is that the $$$ herein used the helicopter on many occasions during the relevant period only between bhopal and $$$ both of which are outside the constituency of the $$$. the admitted fact is that the $$$ was of the star campaigners for the said election for the state of madhya pradesh. therefore he was required to campaign for his political party not only in his constituency but also in other constituencies of the state. in the absence of any allegation that the $$$ used the helicopter for traveling within -churahat constituency for the purpose of campaigning the expenditure incurred on that account in our opinion can not be included in the election expenditure of the $$$. therefore paragraph m of the election petition is liable to be struck off and is accordingly struck off. before parting with this case we would like to place on record that the procedure adopted by the appellant in initially filing a petition under order vii rule petition praying that the election petition be dismissed and filing the instant application after a long gap is to be deprecated. preliminary objections if any in cases where there is more than in an election petition are to be taken at the earliest point of time and in go. the practice such as the adopted by the appellant only tends to delay the adjudication of the election petition which are mandated6 by the parliament to be decided within $$$$ months. we declare that the later of such successive petitions must be dismissed by high courts in limine on that count al. the appeal is therefore partly allowed striking out only paragraph m of the election petition. that the answering respondent therefore respectfully submits that paragraphs from pages to beginning from in the shadow expense register.. annexure p/ i i paragraphs to and be struck of from the pleadings as the same are irrelevant unnecessary frivolous and vexatious.2golding v. wharton $$$ q b d 4it should have ordered a striking out of such of the charges which remained vague and called upon the petitirs to substantiate the allegations in respect of those which were reasonably specific.and london s.p. and i assn. ltd. v. m.v. sea success i manu / sc/05/200manu / sc/05/200 scc para. to the same effect is the decision of this court in liverpool and london s.p. and i assn. ltd. v. m.v. sea success i where this court held that the disclosure of a cause of action in the plaint is a question of fact and the answer to that question must be found only from the reading of the plaint itself. the court trying a suit or an election petition as the position is in the present case shall while examining whether the plaint or the petition discloses a cause of action to assume that the averments made in the plaint or the petition are factually correct. it is only if despite the averments being taken as factually correct the court finds no cause of action emerging from the averments that it may be justified in rejecting the plaint..para. applying the above principles to the case at hand we do not see any error in the order passed by the high court refusing to dismiss the petition in limine on the ground that the same discloses no cause of action. the averments made in the election petition if taken to be factually correct as they ought to for purposes of determining whether a case for exercise of powers under order rule has been made out do in our opinion disclose a cause of action. the high court did not therefore commit any error much less an error resulting in miscarriage of justice to warrant interference by this court in exercise of its extraordinary powers under article of the constitution.footnote.6that is the admitted case rightly even of the appellant at para of the i.a. of it is stated the entire election petition is based on:(a under valuation of the items used in the election campaign(b non disclosure of expenses in respect of certain items alleged to have been used in such election. that during model code of conduct to bribe voters inc candidate / respondent no. through his representative $$$ $$$ has distributed large quantity of demand drafts /
