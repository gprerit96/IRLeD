. leave granted. $$$ for the parties. despite granting sufficient and adequate opportunity to the respondents they did not choose to file objections with regard to the averments made by the applicants / appellants in their applications that they have been in physical and actual possession of the acquired land and compensation also not paid to them. since the above averments of the applicants are not controverted despite granting opportunity the assertions made by the applicants shall have to be accepted as true and correct. further the right of the applicants is accrued under section of the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition rehabilitation and resettlement act for short the act on the date of filing of the applications as they have asserted that they have been in physical and actual possession of the acquired land and also not paid the compensation by the respondents in respect of their acquired land. therefore the contention urged on behalf of the respondents that in view of promulgation of the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition rehabilitation and resettlement amendment $$$ on.by inserting the proviso to sub -section of section of the act the period of stay obtained in the judicial proceedings shall be excluded for computation of years ' period to hold that the acquisition proceedings are lapsed and therefore the said provision does not enure to the benefit of the applicants can not be legally accepted by us in view of the law laid down by this court in the case of garikapati v. subbiah choudhry manu / sc/000/$$$$manu / sc/000/$$$$ air sc. para which is relevant is reproduced hereunder:"from the decisions cited above the following principles clearly $$$ that the legal pursuit of a remedy suit appeal and appeal are really but steps in a series of proceedings all connected by an intrinsic unity and are to be regarded as legal proceeding.the right of appeal is not a mere matter of procedure but is a substantive right.the institution of the suit carries with it the implication that all rights of appeal then in force are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of the career of the suit.the right of appeal is a vested right and such a right to enter the superior court accrues to the litigant and exists as on and from the date the lis commences and although it may be actually exercised when the adverse judgment is pronounced such right is to be governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or proceeding and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of the filing of the appeal.this vested right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise. the aforesaid case is further approved by the constitution bench of this court in the case of shyam sunder v. $$$ manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ scc. paras and of the judgment which are relevant are reproduced hereunder:"2. in garikapati veeraya s. n. subbiah choudhry manu / sc/0008/$$$$manu / sc/0008/$$$$ scr this court observed as thus air p.para the golden rule of construction is that in the absence of anything in the enactment to show that it is to have retrospective operation it can not be so construed as to have the effect of altering the law applicable to a claim in litigation at the time when the act was passed.$$$. in hitendra vishnu thakur and ors. v. state of maharashtra and ors.manu / sc/026/$$$$manu / sc/026/$$$$ scc this court laid down the ambit and scope of an amending act and its retrospective operation as follows scc p.para a statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective in operation unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment whereas a statute which merely affects procedure unless such a construction is textually impossible is presumed to be retrospective in its application should not be given an extended meaning and should be strictly confined to its clearly -defined limits.$$$ relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature whereas law relating to right of action and right of appeal even though remedial is substantive in nature.every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right exists in procedural law.a procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new duties in respect of transactions already accomplished.a statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation unless otherwise provided either expressly or by necessary implication. in k.s. paripoornan v. state of kerala manu / sc/0200/199manu sc/0200/199 scc scc at p.this court while considering the effect of amendment in the land acquisition act in pending proceedings held thus scc para..in the instant case we are concerned with the application of the provisions of sub -section of section as introduced by the amending act to acquisition proceedings which were pending on the date of commencement of the amending act. in relation pending proceedings the approach of the courts in england is that the same are unaffected by the changes in the law so far as they relate to the determination of the substantive rights and in the absence of a clear indication of a contrary intention in an amending enactment the substantive rights of the parties to an action fall to be determined by the law as it existed when the action was commenced and this is so whether the law is changed before the hearing of the case at the instance or while an appeal is pending see $$$ 's laws of england edn.vol. para. from the aforesaid decisions the legal position that emerges is that when a repeal of an enactment is followed by a fresh legislation such legislation does not affect the substantive rights of the parties on the date of suit or adjudication of suit unless such a legislation is retrospective and a court of appeal can not take into consideration a new law brought into existence after the judgment appealed from has been rendered because the rights of the parties in an appeal are determined under the law in force on the date of suit. however the position in law would be different in the matters which relate to procedural law but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment. we are therefore of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending act such legislation is prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. we are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary but an amending act which affects the procedure is presumed to be retrospective unless amending act provides otherwise..... the right conferred to the landholders / owners of the acquired land under section of the act is the statutory right and therefore the said right can not be taken away by an $$$ by inserting proviso to the abovesaid sub -section without giving retrospective effect to the same. taking into consideration the fact that we have allowed similar matters in c.a. no. titled ms. magnum promoters p. ltd. v. union of india and ors.vide order dated.and in other appeals also by following the earlier decisions of this court with regard to taking physical possession of the acquired land by the land acquisition collector which are extensively referred in the above judgment promulgation of the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition rehabilitation and resettlement amendment $$$ was made on.which is prospective in nature and therefore it can not be applied to their cases. for the foregoing reasons the interlocutory applications are allowed and consequently the appeals are also allowed by quashing the acquisition proceedings in relation to the applicants / appellants.
