dr. d.y. chandrachud j. this appeal arises from a judgment and order of a division bench of the high court of judicature at patna dated december which allowed a $$$s patent appeal instituted by the to th respondents. the division bench set aside the judgment and order of the learned single judge dated november by which selections made by promotion from class iv posts to class iii posts in the district court of muzaffarpur were quashed. the division bench has held that the original $$$s who succeeded before the learned single judge in challenging the process of promotion were estopped from doing so having unsuccessfully participated in the selection process. on december the office of the district and sessions judge muzaffarpur issued general order no. of inviting applications for promotion to class posts from amongst class iv employees of the civil court at muzaffarpur. the selection was to be made on the basis of a fresh written test and interview candidates appeared in the written examination which was conducted on april of whom qualified. these candidates were interviewed on july. marks were fixed for the written examination and marks for the interview. the appointment committee selected candidates on the basis of merit for appointment to the class posts by promotion. the select list was submitted to the high court on july. the high court declined to approve the select list on the ground that the marks allotted for the written examination were not in accordance with the court 's general letter no. of and the rules of and covering bihar civil court staff. by a letter dated august the registrar administration directed the district and sessions judge muzaffarpur to hold a fresh examination fixing marks for the written examination by treating the qualifying marks as. accordingly a fresh general order of was issued by the district and sessions judge on october the general order specifically adverted to the communication dated august of the high court and stipulated that a fresh written examination comprising marks would be held with qualifying marks of which would be followed by an interview carrying marks. pursuant to this a written test was held on november followed by an interview on december. results were declared on december and the to teenth respondents were appointed on class posts. all the $$$s participated in the process of selection. the $$$s and other unsuccessful candidates then filed a writ petition before the high court in order to challenge the general order dated october and the order of appointment dated december. the primary ground was that the appointment process was vitiated since under the relevant rules the written test was required to carry marks and the interview marks. $$$ affidavits were filed in response to the writ petition by the registrar of the civil court at muzaffarpur the registrar general of the high court and by the selected candidates. the high court on the administrative side defended its action by placing reliance on its general letter bearing no. of civil dated november which stipulated a written examination comprising of marks with qualifying marks of followed by an interview carrying marks for promotion from class iv to class posts. the high court submitted in its counter affidavit that this general letter continued to hold the field. moreover it was urged that rule of the bihar civil court staff class iii and class iv amendment rules stipulates that promotion from class iv to class posts shall be made by an appointment committee on the basis of merit cum seniority. while the rules of also stipulated the mode of appointment by promotion the procedure for promotion was governed by general $$$ no. of. this it was urged has been reiterated in the administrative instructions issued by the high court on december. the learned single judge of the high court allowed the writ petition and quashed the appointment made by the district and sessions judge muzaffarpur. the learned single judge held that under rule of the bihar civil court staff class iii and class iv amendment rules the written examination was to carry marks and the interview marks instead and in place of the earlier requirement of marks and marks respectively. in the view of the learned single judge once the rules which have been made under article were amended in the earlier rules would stand superseded and the general letter of the high court would not have the effect of overriding the statutory rules. the examination it was noticed was held after the new rules had come into force in july in consequence the learned single judge held that the notification fixing -marks for the written examination and marks for the interview had been correctly issued by the district and sessions judge muzaffarpur who as a result was directed to declare the results of all those who had participated in the selection examination. after the order of the learned single judge a direction was issued by which persons who had been appointed to class posts were reverted to their original class iv posts on november. they filed a letters patent appeal in order to challenge the judgment and order of the learned single judge. in the meantime an order was issued by the district and sessions judge by which persons who were successful in the selection process were promoted to class posts. the candidates included both the $$$s and other candidates. these candidates were also successful in the previous result. as a consequence persons were excluded. the division bench of the high court by a judgment and order dated december allowed the letters patent appeal filed by the to teenth respondents and while setting aside the judgment and order of the learned single judge restored the original order of appointment dated december. the division bench agreed with the construction placed by the learned single judge on the rules of. however while interfering with the judgment of the learned single judge the division bench took the view that the $$$s had in pursuance of the notification issued by the district and sessions judge participated in the selection process without any protest. having failed to raise any objection to the selection process it was held that the $$$s were estopped from turning around and challenging the selection once they were declared unsuccessful. in taking this view the division bench has relied upon the judgments of this court in $$$ v. the government of andhra pradesh $$$ / $$$/00/$$$$$$$ / $$$/00/$$$$ $$$c $$$ v. state of uttaranchal $$$ / $$$/727/$$$$$$$ / $$$/727/$$$$ $$$ $$$ and amlan jyoti borrooah v. state of assam $$$ / sc/0077/$$$$$$$ / sc/0077/$$$$ scc. now at the outset it would be necessary to advert to the provisions of the bihar civil court staff class iii and class iv amendment rules rule provides for the mode of recruitment of class employees through a centralized written examination and oral interview. rule (ii earlier provided that the written test shall consist of marks while marks shall be allotted to the interview rule deals with appointment by promotion. rule stipulates that appointments from class iii to class iv posts on promotion shall be made by the appointment committee on the basis of merit cum seniority. rule is in the following terms for promotion in terms of the preceding rule the appointment committee shall hold a separate examination of the eligible candidates and call for interview only such candidates who obtain the qualifying marks in the written examination. the bihar civil court staff class iii and class iv amendment rules were notified with effect from july. rules to were substituted. rule governs the mode of recruitment of class employees rule provides for a written test of marks and an interview consisting of marks totally aggregating to marks the qualifying marks for the written examination are to be. rule provides for appointment by promotion in the following terms appointment by promotion-(i the appointments to class posts by promotion from class iv posts shall also be made by the appointment committee on merit -cum -seniority basis;(ii percent of vacant class iii posts shall be made reserved for promotion from class iv employees who possess the minimum educational qualification and have year experience in the post held by them;(iii for promotion in terms of the preceding rule the appointment committee shall hold a separate examination of the eligible candidates and call for interview only such candidates who obtain the qualifying marks in the written examination.under rule 7(iv all appointments are subject to such directions as may be issued by the high court from time to time. rule enables the high court to qualify or supplement the rules by issuing a general or special direction from time to time. the amended rules of as noted above provide for the recruitment of class employees in rule (iv and for appointment by promotion from class iv to class posts in rule. rule stipulates that for promotion in terms of the preceding rule the appointment committee shall hold a separate examination of the eligible candidates and call for interview only such candidates who obtain the qualifying marks in the written examination. the learned single judge held that in consequence rule incorporates the requirement which is provided in rule of a written examination consisting of marks an interview of marks and qualifying marks of in the written test. the division bench on adverting to the provisions of rules and of the rules noticed that there was some scope for interpretation on account of vagueness of the rules. however on the balance the division bench was not inclined to differ with the view of the learned single judge on the interpretation of the rules. the basic issue that was addressed by the division bench was that the $$$s having participated in the fresh round of selection could not be permitted to assail the process once they were declared unsuccessful. on this aspect a brief recapitulation of the facts would be in order. in the original process of selection following the issuance of general order no. of by the district and sessions judge muzaffarpur on december a written examination was held on april consisting of marks followed by an interview on july consisting of marks the high court declined to approve of the selection list and issued through its registrar administration a communication dated august requiring the holding of a fresh written examination carrying marks in which the qualifying marks would be regarded as in terms of its general letter no. of. pursuant thereto a circular was issued in the form of a new general order bearing no. of on october which stipulated that in terms of the directions issued by the high court on august a fresh written examination would be held carrying marks with qualifying marks as followed by an interview of marks. candidates who had applied earlier were not required to apply afresh. the $$$s participated in the fresh process of selection. if the $$$s were aggrieved by the decision to hold a fresh process they did not espouse their remedy. instead they participated in the fresh process of selection and it was only upon being unsuccessful that they challenged the result in the writ petition. this was clearly not open to the $$$s. the principle of estoppel would operate. the law on the subject has been crystalized in several decisions of this court. in chandra prakash tiwari v. shakuntala shukla $$$ / sc/07/$$$$$$$ / sc/07/$$$$ scc this court laid down the principle that when a candidate appears at an examination without objection and is subsequently found to be not successful a challenge to the process is precluded. the question of entertaining a petition challenging an examination would not arise where a candidate has appeared and participated he or she can not subsequently turn around and contend that the process was unfair or that there was a lacuna therein merely because the result is not palatable. in union of india v. s. $$$ / sc/726/$$$$$$$ / sc/726/$$$$ scc this court held that:8. it is also well settled that those candidates who had taken part in the selection process knowing fully well the procedure laid down therein were not entitled to question the same..see also $$$ v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/072/$$$$ scc and $$$ v. m.p. public service commission $$$ / sc/8586/$$$$$$$ / sc/8586/$$$$ scc.the same view was reiterated in $$$ supra where it was held to be well settled that candidates who have taken part in a selection process knowing fully well the procedure laid down therein are not entitled to question it upon being declared to be unsuccessful.in $$$ v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/65/$$$$$$$ / sc/65/$$$$ scc the same principle was reiterated in the following observations:6. we also agree with the high court that after having taken part in the process of selection knowing fully well that % marks have been earmarked for viva voce test the $$$ is not entitled to challenge the criteria or process of selection. surely if the $$$ 's name had appeared in the merit list he would not have even dreamed of challenging the selection. the $$$ invoked jurisdiction of the high court under article of the constitution of india only after he found that his name does not figure in the merit list prepared by the commission. this conduct of the petitir clearly disentitles him from questioning the selection and the high court did not commit any error by refusing to entertain the writ petition. reference in this connection may be made to the judgments in $$$ v. state of j. and k. $$$ / sc/0208/$$$$$$$ / sc/0208/$$$$ scc $$$ v. government of andhra pradesh and ors. $$$ / sc/800/$$$$$$$ / sc/800/$$$$ scc $$$ and ors. v. state of uttaranchal and ors. $$$ / sc/7287/$$$$$$$ / sc/7287/$$$$ scc amlan jyoti borooah v. state of assam manu / sc/0077/$$$$manu / sc/0077/$$$$ scc and k.a. nagamani v. indian airlines and ors. supra.in vijendra kumar verma v. public service commission manu / sc/0808/20manu / sc/0808/20 scc candidates who had participated in the selection process were aware that they were required to possess certain specific qualifications in computer operations. the $$$s had appeared in the selection process and after participating in the interview sought to challenge the selection process as being without jurisdiction. this was held to be impermissible.in $$$ v. $$$ / sc/037/$$$$manu / sc/037/$$$$ scc candidates who were competing for the post of physiotherapist in the state of uttrakhand participated in a written examination held in pursuance of an advertisement. this court held that if they had cleared the test the respondents would not have raised any objection to the selection process or to the methodology adopted. having taken a chance of selection it was held that the respondents were disentitled to seek relief under article and would be deemed to have waived their right to challenge the advertisement or the procedure of selection. this court held that:8. it is settled law that a person who consciously takes part in the process of selection can not thereafter turn around and question the method of selection and its outcome.in chandigarh administration v. $$$ / sc/0777/$$$$manu / sc/0777/$$$$ scc it was held that a candidate who takes a calculated risk or chance by subjecting himself or herself to the selection process can not turn around and complain that the process of selection was unfair after knowing of his or her non -selection. in pradeep $$$ v. $$$ pandey manu / sc/0588/$$$$manu / sc/0588/$$$$ scc this court held that moreover we would concur with the division bench on more point that the $$$s had participated in the process of interview and not challenged it till the results were declared. there was a gap of almost months between the interview and declaration of result. however the $$$s did not challenge it at that time. this it appears that only when the $$$s found themselves to be unsuccessful they challenged the interview. this can not be allowed. the candidates can not approbate and reprobate at the same time. either the candidates should not have participated in the interview and challenged the procedure or they should have challenged immediately after the interviews were conducted.this principle has been reiterated in a recent judgment in madras institute of development v. s.k. shiva subaramanyam manu / sc/0886/205manu / sc/0886/205 scc. in the present case regard must be had to the fact that the $$$s were clearly on notice when the fresh selection process took place that written examination would carry marks and the interview marks. the $$$s participated in the selection process. moreover other considerations weigh in balance. the high court noted in the impugned judgment that the interpretation of rule was not free from vagueness. there was in other words no glaring or patent illegality in the process adopted by the high court. there was an element of vagueness about whether rule which dealt with promotion merely incorporated the requirement of an examination provided in rule for direct recruitment to class iii posts or whether the marks and qualifying marks were also incorporated. moreover no prejudice was established to have been caused to the $$$s by the allocation. the decision in $$$ v. $$$ / $$$ sc/140/$$$$ scc which was relied upon by the $$$s involved a case where government was found to have committed glaring illegalities in the procedure. hence it was held that the principle of estoppel by conduct or acquiescence had no application. the decision is distinguishable. in this view of the matter the division bench can not held to be in error in coming to the conclusion that it was not open to the $$$s after participating in the selection process to question the result once they were declared to be unsuccessful. during the course of the hearing this court is informed that out of candidates who were ultimately selected figured both in the process of selection as well as in the subsequent selection. candidate is stated to have retired. the apprehension now is of the remaining candidate being reverted as a result of the judgment of the division bench of the high court. in our view it would be appropriate if the equities are duly adjusted by a suitable direction. we are of the view that the ends of the justice would be met by a direction that in the event that there is any existing vacancy $$$ who has still continued in service may be allowed to continue to work on the class iii post in which he is currently working on a provisional basis until the next round of selection process takes place. the appellant would be at liberty to participate in the selection process that may be held in future and in the event he is declared successful he would be at liberty to make a representation to the competent authority for consideration of the period spent by him on the class iii post for the purpose of fixation of seniority. subject to the above direction the judgment of the division bench and the high court is affirmed. the appeal shall accordingly stand disposed of in the above terms. there shall be no order as to costs.
