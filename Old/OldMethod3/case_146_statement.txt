v.n. khare c.j. the appellants herein are the tenants. the landlord brought a suit for eviction of the tenant inter alia on the ground of personal necessity as well as far default in payment of rent. the trial court dismissed the suit. however the appellate court allowed the appeal of landlord and thus the suit on the ground of default was decreed. the appeal by the tenants was dismissed. the high court held that mere acceptance of delayed rent by the landlord did not amount to waiver of the right which was accrued to him under the act and also the tenant has committed default in payment of the rent. it is against the said judgment the tenants preferred present appeal by means of a special leave petition. when the matter camp up before a bench of this court the bench was of the view that as the case may require consideration of the correctness of the view taken by a full bench of patna high court in raj kumar prasad v. $$$ narain singh $$$ / $$$ / bh/00/ $$$ in view decisions of this court in gowali charan v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/1$$$ / sc/0/1 jt1(1)sc2 and $$$ v. smt. $$$ and ors. plr sc both by -judge bench and as such has referred the matter to a bench of ld. judges. it is in this way this matter has come up before us. $$$ for the appellant urged that view taken by the high court is in conflict with the decisions of this court and therefore the judgment under challenge deserved to be set aside. we do not find any merit in the argument for the reasons stated hereinafter.  of the bihar buildings lease rent & eviction control act reads thus:". eviction of tenants -notwithstanding anything contained in my contract or law to the contrary but subject to the provisions of the industrial disputes act act xiv of and to those section where a tenant is in possession of any building he shall not be liable to eviction therefrom except in execution of a decree passed by the court on or more of the following $$$.....where the amount of months rents lawfully payable by the tenant and due from him is in arrears by not having been paid within the time fixed by contract or in the absence of such contract by $$$$ following that for which the rent is payable or by not having been validly remitted or deposited in accordance with section. the provisions of the said act would clearly show that unlike rent control statutes of other states the expression wilful default or habitual default has not been used therein. the words are is in arrears. in the event rent for months is not paid a cause of action arises. the statute mandates that the rent should be paid within the time fixed by the contract and in absence thereof by $$$$ following. the obligation on the part of the tenant to pay rent in the manner laid down under the act being a statutory one he must comply therewith strictly. the statute therefore in other words prescribes the period within which the rent must be rendered to the landlord by a tenant. when the statute lays down the period during which the rent is required to be paid or deposited the same is required to be complied with. recently in e. $$$ v. $$$ dead by lrs. and ors. $$$ / sc/0/2002$$$ / sc/0/2002 $$$ a division bench of this court observed..the rent legislation is normally intended for the benefit of the tenants. at the same time it is well settled that the benefit conferred on the tenants through the relevant statutes can be enjoyed only on the basis of strict compliance with the statutory provisions. equitable consideration has no place in such matters.. it is also pertinent to note that the rent control act is not only a beneficial enactment for the tenant but also for the benefit of the landlord. see shri lakshmi venkateshwara enterprises pvt. ltd. v. $$$ smt.and ors. $$$ / sc/066/$$$ / sc/066/. yet there a another aspect of the matter which can not be lost sight of. it is a well settled principle that if a thing is required to be by a private person within a specified time the same would ordinarily be mandatory but when a public functionary is required to perform a public function within a time -frame the same will be held to be directory unless the consequences therefore are specified. in sutherland statutory construction edition vol. at p. it is pointed out that a statutory direction to private individuals should generally be considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that which obtains with respect to public officers. again at p. it is pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory or directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of be result that shall follow non -compliance with the provision. at page it is stated as a corollary of the rule outlined above the fact that no consequences of non -compliance are stated in the statute has been considered as a factor tending towards a directory construction. but this is only an element to be considered and is by no means conclusive. it is in the aforementioned backdrop the decisions of this court relied upon by mr. $$$ are required to be considered. in gowli charan v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0758/1987$$$ / sc/0758/1987 this court did not lay down any law within the meaning of article of the constitution of india. the judgment does not contain any reason. it does not set out any fact nor did it take notice of any precedent. it is difficult to ascertain as to on what grounds this court observed:"having regard to the fact that the entire rent for the period in question from january -february to january -february had been paid to the plaintiff we do not think that the high court was justified in holding that the plea of wilful default has been established entitling the plaintiff to a decree for eviction under section of the bihar building lease rent and eviction control act. this decision in our opinion does not lay down the correct law and must be over -ruled. in satyanarain kandu v. smt. $$$ and ors. plr sc this court passed an order presumably in exercise of its jurisdiction under article of constitution of india. in that case it was categorically held that the default had taken place but the same was held to be merely a technical. if a cause of action arose for the landlord to file a suit for eviction against the tenant such a cause of action can not be held to be non -existent only because in the opinion of this court the default was technical. the said decision also does not lay down the correct view of the law and must be over -ruled. we therefore are of the opinion that the high court has rightly held that by reason of the said decisions the full bench decision of the high court can not be said to have been over -ruled. in c.a. no. which we have decided $$$$ we have held that where a statute empowers the court to extend time or further time when a tenant fails to deposit rent within the stipulated time only in such cases the court possesses power to extend time and in no other cases. for aforesaid reasons the appeal is dismissed. however there shall be no order as to costs.
