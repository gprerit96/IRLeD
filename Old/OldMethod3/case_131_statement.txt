$$$ j. a -judge $$$ while dealing with the interpretation of provisions of sections of the industrial disputes act for short the act vis -ã   a voluntary retirement $$$ framed by the state of $$$ noticed that the conclusion arrived at by the division $$$ of the high court of $$$ in $$$ no. of whereby it had given the stamp of approval to the judgment and order dated 1st march passed by the learned single judge of the said court in $$$ no. of holding inter alia that once the workmen had availed the voluntary retirement $$$ and received the special compensation package they could not have put forth a claim for lay -off compensation under section of the act and in that context perceived a discordant note in national buildings construction corporation v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc and a.k. bindal and anr. v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc and thereafter scanning the anatomy of the act referred the matter to a larger $$$ in a. $$$ and ors. v. presiding officer labour court guntur and ors. $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ scc by stating thus the right of the workman to claim payment of lay off compensation is not denied or disputed. if the said claim has no nexus with the voluntary retirement $$$ in our opinion in a given case like the present it is possible to hold that a proceeding under section of the act would be maintainable. we are therefore of the opinion that the question being of some importance should be considered by the larger $$$ as there exists an apparent conflict in the said decisions in national buildings construction corporation supra and a.k. bindal supra.because of the aforesaid order the matter has been placed before us. the expose of facts are that the $$$s were employees of nagarjuna cooperative sugars limited for short the company a government of $$$ undertaking. it was declared as a relief undertaking in terms of the a.p. relief undertaking special provisions act for brevity the act. as is evident the management of the industrial undertaking declared lay -off wherefore compensation was to be paid. the employees -union of the company preferred a writ petition in the high court of $$$ assailing the memorandum no. 0/sug / a/ -dated th january whereunder the workmen were not granted compensation and in fact were deprived of the same. it was urged by the workmen that the lay -off compensation was paid only for the months of june and july though they were entitled to get the said compensation for the period.to.. when the matter stood thus the state of $$$ transferred the company to s.c.m. sugars limited which absorbed some of the workmen and out of the said absorbed employees some of them were paid lay -off compensation and some were not extended the benefit. be it stated at point of time all the employees had expressed their willingness to continue to work under the transferee -management. at a later stage the government of $$$ allowed the said transferee -company to shift the factory to the state of karnataka as a consequence of which the workmen lost the opportunity to continue to be employed. as the factual matrix would unfurl the government of $$$ issued g.o. ms. no. dated may provided for a special compensation package for the employees. the condition that was incorporated in the package was to the effect that the amount of compensation was to be paid to the workmen only in the event if they had not opted for employment with the transferee company. we shall refer to the voluntary retirement $$$ vrs at a later stage. as the factual score would further undrape the $$$s opted for voluntary retirement and they were paid the amount of special compensation in terms of the vrs. it is apposite to note here that as the said scheme did not make any provision for payment of lay -off compensation the $$$s moved the high court under article of the constitution of india by preferring $$$ no. of. the relief sought in the writ petition was resisted by the transferee company urging that the workmen having accepted the benefits under the vrs and there had been cessation of relationship between the employer and employee the writ petition was not maintainable and the relief sought in the writ petition could not be acceded to. the learned single judge upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties opined that it would be appropriate for the writ petitioners to approach the industrial tribunal and work out their remedies by way of a claim petition and by leading appropriate evidence before the said court. the high court be it noted granted liberty to the workmen to raise all issues which were available including those which had been raised in the writ petition and accordingly disposed of the writ petition. in pursuance of the aforesaid order the workmen filed a petition under section of the act claiming lay -off compensation before the presiding officer labour court guntur that formed the subject matter of c.f.r. no. un -no. m.p. the labour court dismissed the application as not maintainable on the foundation that the claimants were not workmen under section of the act having received all the benefits under vrs. aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the labour court the $$$s herein preferred w.p. no. of. the learned single judge referred to the authority in a.k. bindal supra adverted to the decision of the bombay high court in $$$ v. pal vrs employees welfare association -llj bombay that dealt with existing individual rights in the context of section of the act distinguished the decision rendered in government soap factory bangalore v. labour court air mysore and eventually held that the labour court had correctly exercised the jurisdiction by coming to hold that the writ petitioners were no more workmen within the meaning of section of the act and hence there was no warrant for any interference in exercise of jurisdiction under article of the constitution. dissatisfaction of non -success compelled the writ petitioners to prefer writ appeal no. of and the division $$$ concurred with the view expressed by the learned single judge in view of the dictum of this court in a.k. bindal supra. hence the present appeal by special leave. we have already noted how the matter has been placed before the -judge $$$. section of the act defines the workman as follows:"workman means any person including an apprentice employed in any industry to do any manual unskilled skilled technical operational clerical or supervisory work for hire or reward whether the terms of employment be express or implied and for the purposes of any proceeding under this act in relation to an industrial dispute includes any such person who has been dismissed discharged or retrenched in connection with or as a consequence of that dispute or whose dismissal discharge or retrenchment has led to that dispute but does not include any such person who is subject to the air force act of or the army act of or the navy act of who is employed in the police service or as an officer or other employee of a prison or(iii who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity who being employed in a supervisory capacity draws wages exceeding rupees per mensem or exercises either by the nature of the duties attached to the office or by reason of the powers vested in him functions mainly of a managerial nature. section of the act reads as follows where any workman is entitled to receive from the employer any money or any benefit which is capable of being computed in terms of money and if any question arises as to the amount of money due or as to the amount at which such benefit should be computed then the question may subject to any rules that may be made under this act be decided by such labour court as may be specified in this behalf by the appropriate government within a period not exceeding months]:provided that where the presiding officer of a labour court considers it necessary or expedient so to do he may for reasons to be recorded in writing extend such period by such further period as he may think fit. in a.k. bindal supra a -judge $$$ was considering the grant of pay revision in respect of companies which came under the board for industrial and financial reconstruction for short bifr. in the said case an issue also arose with regard to the framing of voluntary retirement scheme pertaining to the grievance of non -revision of the pay scale of the workmen. it was contended by the respondents therein that the employees having taken vrs and having taken the amount without any demur the relationship of employee and employer had ceased to exist and therefore they can not raise any grievance regarding the non -revision of pay scale. the said submission was opposed on the ground that employees had no option in the matter and accepted vrs under compulsion and further under the vrs the total compensation amounts have to be calculated as there was revision of pay scale since as claimed by the workmen and in that context opined thus:4. this shows that a considerable amount is to be paid to an employee gratia besides the terminal benefits in case he opts for voluntary retirement under the $$$ and his option is accepted. the amount is paid not for doing any work or rendering any service. it is paid in lieu of the employee himself leaving the services of the company or the industrial establishment and foregoing all his claims or rights in the same. it is a package deal of give and take. that is why in the business world it is known as golden handshake. the main purpose of paying this amount is to bring about a complete cessation of the jural relationship between the employer and the employee. after the amount is paid and the employee ceases to be under the employment of the company or the undertaking he leaves with all his rights and there is no question of his again agitating for any kind of his past rights with his erstwhile employer including making any claim with regard to enhancement of pay scale for an earlier period. if the employee is still permitted to raise a grievance regarding enhancement of pay scale from a retrospective date even after he has opted for voluntary retirement scheme and has accepted the amount paid to him the whole purpose of introducing the scheme would be totally frustrated. the contention that the employees opted for vrs under any kind of compulsion is not worthy of acceptance. the petitioners are officers of the companies and are mature enough to weigh the pros and cons of the options which were available to them. they could have waited and pursued their claim for revision of pay scale without opting for vrs. however they in their wisdom thought that in the fact situation vrs was a better option available and chose the same. after having applied for vrs and taken the money it is not open to them to contend that they exercised the option under any kind of compulsion. in view of the fact that nearly -per cent of employees have availed of the vrs scheme and have left the companies fci and hfc the writ petition no longer survives and has become infructuous. in $$$ supra this court was dealing with a case wherein the respondent was dismissed from service w.f. september. he was suspended on october and the order of suspension remained in force till september. during the period of suspension on october he was transferred to delhi. after dismissal the respondent applied to the labour court at delhi under section of the act for computing the benefits and amounts he was entitled to receive alleging that he had not been paid such amounts and benefits. the labour court framed certain issues and decided the claim in favour of the employee. the only question that arose before this court pertained to jurisdiction of the labour court to entertain the employees ' application under section of the act. according to the $$$s the respondent -employee having already been dismissed had ceased to be the workman from the date of application and therefore he had no locus standi to approach the labour court under section of the act. on behalf of the respondent it was argued that if the period in respect of which benefits and amounts are claimed under section of the act was during the course of his employment prior to dismissal then mere fact that he was dismissed by the employer before he could apply to the labour court under section would not deprive him of his right to claim relief under that section. the court posed the question whether section of the act can be invoked by dismissed workman in respect of benefits and salary due to him for the period prior to the date of his dismissal. the court referred to the authorities in central bank of india v. p.s. $$$ / sc/0149/196$$$ / sc/0149/196 scr and m / s. kesoram cotton mills ltd. v. gangadhar and ors. $$$ / sc/0144/1963$$$ / sc/0144/1963 scr and distinguished the said cases as the factual background was different. however it reproduced certain passages from p.s. $$$ supra because the court in the said decision has discussed the legislative history of chapter v -a and section of the act and observed that in our opinion on a fair and reasonable construction of $$$ -section it is clear that if a workman 's right to receive the benefit is dispute that may have to be determined by the labour court. before proceeding to compute the benefit in terms of money the labour court inevitably has to deal with the question as to whether the workman has a right to receive that benefit. if the said right is not disputed nothing more needs to be done and the labour court can proceed to compute the value of the benefit in terms of money but if the said right is disputed the labour court must deal with that question and decide whether the workman has the right to receive the benefit as alleged by him and it is only if the labour court answers this point in favour of title workman that the next question of making necessary computation can arise.and again besides it seems to us that if the $$$ 's construction is accepted it would necessarily mean that it would be at the option of the employer to allow the workman to avail himself of the remedy provided by $$$ -section because he has merely to raise an objection on the ground that the right claimed by the workman is not admitted to oust the jurisdiction of the labour court to entertain the workman 's application. the claim under section clearly postulates that the determination of the question about computing the benefit in terms of money may in some cases have to be preceded by an enquiry into the existence of the right and such an enquiry must be held to be incidental to the main determination which has been assigned to the labour court by sub -section. after reproducing the said passages the court referred to the authority in u.p. electric supply co. ltd. v. r.k. $$$ and anr. $$$ / sc/0333/$$$$$$$ / sc/0333/$$$$ air sc scc wherein the court after review of various decisions had upheld the jurisdiction of the labour court to entertain application for lay off -compensation under section observing that such jurisdiction could not be ousted by a mere plea denying the workman 's claim for computation of the benefit in terms of money adding that the labour court had to go into the question and determine whether on the facts it had jurisdiction to make the computation. $$$ the court in pritam $$$ supra referred to number of decisions and posed the question thus the crucial point which requires consideration on the $$$ 's argument is thus confined to the precise scope and meaning of the word workman used in section in the background of the definition of this word as contained in section. $$$ it was held this section was enacted for the purpose of enabling individual workman to implement enforce or execute their existing individual rights against their employers without being compelled to have recourse to section by raising disputes and securing a reference which is obviously a lengthy process. section of the act has accordingly been described as a provision which clothes the labour court with the powers similar to those of an executing court so that the workman concerned receives speedy relief in respect of his existing individual rights. the primary purpose of the section being to provide the aggrieved workman with a forum similar to the executing courts it calls for a broad and beneficial construction consistently with other provisions of the act which should serve to advance the remedy and to suppress the mischief. it may appropriately be pointed out that the mischief which section was designed to suppress was the difficulties faced by individual workmen in getting relief in respect of their existing rights without having resort to section of the act. to accept the argument of the $$$ it would always be open to an unfair unsympathetic and unscrupulous employer to terminate the services of his employee in order to deprive him of the benefit conferred by section and compel him to have resort to the lengthy procedure by way of reference under section of the act thereby defeating the very purpose and object of enacting this provision. this in our view quite clearly brings out the repugnancy visualised in the opening part of section of the act and such a position could hardly have been contemplated by the legislature. in order to remove this repugnancy section must be so construed as to take within its fold a workman who was employed during the period in respect of which he claims relief even though he is no longer employed at the time of the application. in other words the term workman as used in section includes all persons whose claim requiring computation under this sub -section is in respect of an existing right arising from his relationship as an industrial workman with his employer. by adopting this construction alone can we advance the remedy and suppress the mischief in accordance with the purpose and object of inserting section in the act. we are therefore inclined to agree with the view taken by the madras decisions and we approve of their approach. according to $$$ in cases where there is no dispute about the employee 's right which is not denied he will be entitled to file a suit. whether or not the right of suit can be claimed by the employee we are not persuaded on the basis of this argument to accept the construction canvassed on behalf of the $$$ and deny to a dismissed employee the benefit of speedy remedy under section of the act.emphasis. it needs to be noted that after so stating the -judge $$$ clarified that its pronouncement was strictly in the context of the act. the court opined that in the case at hand they were only concerned with the act and it should not be treated as expression of an opinion as regards the provisions of the minimum wages act. be it stated immediately in the case at hand to appreciate the applicability of the provisions contained in section of the act it is necessary to appreciate the benefits available to the employees under the vrs. the benefits which are available are reproduced below benefits the following benefits are payable to the employees covered under the scheme.terminal benefits the following benefits as statutorily due will be paid as per eligibility.i. the balance in the p.f. account payable as per the cpf regulation. cash equivalent of accumulated earned leave as per the rules of the enterprise.iii. gratuity as per the provisions of the payment of gratuity act or other applicable rules of the organisation.ex -gratia benefits an employee who is regular or permanent whose request for vrs is accepted would be entitled to an ex -gratia payment equivalent to and $$$$ emoluments pay + da last drawn for each completed $$$$ of service or the $$$$ emoluments at the time of retirement multiplied by $$$$ of service left before normal date of retirement whichever is less subject to a minimum of rs.  rupees only.month / months notice pay as per the service conditions applicable.if the application of an employee opting for vrs is accepted instantaneously and payment is arranged by the management on $$$$ the concerned individual would be entitled for payment of -gratia along with pay for notice -period.payment of -gratia for services rendered or left over service(whichever is less as well as the amount payable for the notice period should however not exceed the basic pay + da that would have been paid to the employee who has opted for vrs till the date of his superannuation.where the management takes times to take a decision on the acceptance of an application submitted by the employees for vrs and allows the notice period to lapse or the employee concerned has drawn full salary during the notice period served by him the pay for notice period would not be admissible as the employee has already drawn the salary for the notice period.in addition the employee and his family would also be entitled to travel fare of the admissible class to his native place within the state of andhra pradesh which will be verified with reference to his l.t.c. file.for calculation of -gratia under the scheme the fraction of service viz.months and above will be treated as year and service of less than months will be ignored.eol upto a period of year will be considered for calculation of -gratia benefits provided the service regulations of the concerned organizations permit sanction of such eol. we need not refer to the other clauses as they do not really provide for any kind of benefit but stipulate the various aspects for implementation of the vrs and the procedure to be adopted. on a perusal of the vrs it is clear $$$$ that it did not deal with the lay -off compensation. as has been laid down in $$$ supra a claim pertaining to non -payment of suspension allowance could be agitated under the said provision in spite of the employee being dismissed from service. in a.k. bindal supra the -judge bench has held that after acceptance of the scheme and availing of benefits under vrs an employee could not claim higher wages. the controversy was different. if the vrs had mentioned about the lay -off compensation needless to say the claim would have been covered and the amount received by the workmen would have been deemed to have been covered the quantum of lay -off compensation. that is not the factual position. therefore the controversy that arose in $$$ supra and the dispute that emanated in a.k. bindal supra are quite different. hence we are disposed to think that there exists no conflict between $$$ supra and a.k. bindal supra. we think it appropriate to say that though there is cessation of relationship between the employee and the employer in vrs but if it does not cover the past dues like lay -off compensation subsistence allowance etc.the workman would be entitled to approach the labour court under section of the act. if it is specifically covered or the language of vrs would show that it covers the claim under the scheme no forum will have any jurisdiction. with the aforesaid clarification we would have directed to list the matter before the -judge bench. it is not so required. it is noticeable that the claim relating to lay -off compensation is not covered in the vrs. the labour court learned single judge and the division bench have declined to entertain the claim on the ground that they had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. we have already held that claim pertaining to lay -off compensation having not been part of the vrs the labour court has jurisdiction to adjudicate under section of the act. therefore we set aside the judgment and order of the high court and that of the labour court. $$$ the appeal is allowed the impugned judgments and orders are set aside and the matter is remitted to the labour court for adjudication in accordance with law. the labour court shall finalise the claim preferred under section of the act on its own merits within months hence. the parties are directed to appear before the labour court on 17th october. there shall be no order as to costs.
