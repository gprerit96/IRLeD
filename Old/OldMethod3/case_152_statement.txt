m.b. shah j. with respect i regret for my inability to agree with the judgment rendered by my learned brother justice agrawal. at the outset it requires to be stated that this case illustrates how faulty delayed casual unscientific investigation and lapse of long period in trial affects the administration of justice which in turn certain shakes the public confidence in the system. is it not possible for the authorities to find out ways and means for speedy efficient scientific investigation in at least heinous brutal carnage and for trying the case within $$$$ of occurrence if this is not d it is of no use to complaint that accused are not punished in such cases. in any case for deciding such criminal case it is the bounden duty of the court to appreciate the evidence brought on record as it is in accordance with established law without being influenced by the allegations leveled by the prosecuting agency or by the incident. before appreciating the evidence i would refer to the observations of this $$$ in state delhi admn.v. $$$ / sc//$$$ / sc// observed as under:-"mankind has shifted from the state of nature towards a civilized society and it is no longer the physical power of a litigating individual or the might of the ruler nor even the opinion of the majority that takes away the liberty of a citizen by convicting him and making him suffer a sentence of imprisonment. award of punishment following conviction at a trial in a system wedded to rule of law is the outcome of cool deliberation in the court room after adequate hearing is afforded to the parties accusations are brought against the accused the prosecutor is given an opportunity of supporting the charge and the accused is equally given an opportunity of meeting the accusations by establishing his innocence. it is the outcome of cool deliberations and the screening of the material by the informed mind of the judge that leads to determination of the lis.. in the present case in gruesome carnage persons lost their lives some houses / huts were burnt number of persons were injured and in that case charge -sheet was submitted against persons. out of them were tried by the designated $$$ of sessions judge $$$ in g.r. case no. of $$$ police station case no. of under the provisions of terrorist and disruptive activities prevention act hereinafter referred to as tada act

therein. by this judgment and order $$$ no. of filed by a- $$$ paswan alias $$$ dusadh $$$ a- $$$ alias dharo singh a- $$$ and the death reference no. of filed by the state against these accused are disposed of. in heinous crime where persons lost their lives prosecution has not examined the informant $$$ therefore it would be difficult to refer to the contents of the fir. however we would refer to evidence of pw $$$ inspector who was station -in -charge of police station $$$. it is his say that on th february at about.p. when he was ready for patrolling all of a sudden he head noise of explosions. he therefore along with the sub -inspector and other available armed force jawans left the police station for finding out as to what has happened. on the way he met $$$ who was the mukhia of the village but he was not having any information with regard to the incident. he along with $$$ started for going ahead. after going at some distance they saw that the sky was red because of flames. $$$ they approached village $$$ and saw $$$ and bhola paswan chowkidars of the village and $$$ dafadar. pw enquired from them about the lit up village towards the cast of village $$$. it is his say that they were frightened and informed him that some party people have attacked the village $$$. they used the word party for militants. as he was hearing the noises of bombs and bullets he gave information to the superintendent of police who directed him to proceed towards the place of occurrence. they left the mobile jeep on the road and when they were proceeding towards village $$$ they were attacked by the extremists from the western side of village $$$. they also opened fire in self defence. meantime superintendent of police reached there at about.p. along with police force. it is his say that thereafter they reached village $$$ at about.a.where they heard the slogan whoever comes near the village will be eliminated. after some shouts young person whose hands were tied at the back came running and on being asked he told that he was $$$. after seeing that police has arrived militants started running towards the east. when they entered the village there was total quietness. they found the bridge on the canal about yards east of the village. they found dead bodies of people scattered in the fields. their hands were tied at the back and their throats were slit. $$$ information was conveyed immediately to inspector general of police $$$ and other senior police officers. he took the injured for medical treatment at magadh medical college hospital. informant $$$ gave statement ex. which was recorded as fard beyan. $$$ the formal f.i.r. ex. was written by $$$ inspector of ps tekri. it is his say that place of incident is village $$$ which is about km. from the police station tekri. in the said village there are houses out of which are those $$$ of harijan of gwala community and the rest of the houses are those of bhumihar community. the militants took the villagers from their houses in the field adjacent to $$$ situated at a distance of yards on the northern side of the village from where they took them in the grass field and then to the bridge on the eastern side of the canal and after tying their hands with their own clothes killed them by slitting their throats. it is his say that $$$ a- was arrested from alipur bus stand on.. his statement was recorded and thereafter he was sent to judicial custody. the statement of other witnesses could not be recorded as no witness as under condition of giving statement. $$$ superintendent of police on.directed that the investigation of the incident should be conducted by $$$. as $$$ was not available investigation was handed over to inspector $$$. in cross -examination he admitted that the entire investigation was conducted by $$$. he had not recorded the statement of any witness including that of chowkidars krishna yadav and bhola paswan and dafadar ram yogesh singh. he also admitted that $$$$ diary entry no. of was not with him. he admitted that he had not seen the notification of tada. he had not taken approval of superintendent of police and director general of police before commencing investigation and he began investigation upon oral instructions of superintendent of police and thereafter handed over the investigation to subhash chander sharma pw. he denied the suggestion that $$$ found the accused persons named in the fir to be innocent and that to suppress the investigation d by $$$ and diary written by him he had written an anti -dated diary and that was d to till -up the gap of investigation carried out by $$$. it is to be stated that $$$ is not examined by the prosecution even though he was the inspector of $$$ police station and it is on the record that he also conducted investigation of this case nor his case diary is brought on record. pw sunil kumar superintendent of police is also examined. it is his say that after receipt of the information he along with armed force reached village $$$ at about.to.in the on $$$$ of incident. there he saw lot of people had been killed by slitting their throats. some houses had also been set on fire. some persons were lying injured and they were sent to hospital in police vehicle. on.he received information of the arrest of $$$$ $$$ of village $$$ p.s. bodhgaya. he went there and informed $$$$ $$$ that whatever statement he wanted to give he should make without fear or favour and thereafter he recorded the confessional statement of $$$$ $$$ under tada act. that statement was recorded by $$$ inspector p.s. chandauti. before the court he could not identify who was $$$$ $$$. in cross -examination he stated that all the police personnel of p.s. $$$ including the station -in -charge were involved in arresting the accused persons and that number of vips were visiting the place and the police officers were busy. therefore investigation was entrusted to police inspector of p.s. chandauti. he did not remember as to whether they took written permission to invoke tada act. he also stated that he can not say that under the tada act investigation can be carried out only by an officer of the rank of dsp or above. pw $$$ who was posted as station -in -charge of p.s. bodhgaya stated about arrest of $$$$ $$$ ravindra singh and $$$ in connection with lavlesh police station case no. under the arms act. in cross -examination he admitted that he is accused in a murder case and that he has filed appeal before supreme $$$ for quashing or cognizance taken against him in connection with death of $$$ nephew of $$$ who is of the accused in the present case. from the aforesaid evidence of police officers it appears that in a carnage where brutal and heinous murders took place the investigation was not proper and statements were not recorded immediately for or the other reason. the prosecution has also failed at least to examine the informant $$$. keeping these facts in background i would now refer to the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellants. the case of the prosecution against these convicted accused depends upon the evidence of pw belmati devi pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ $$$ pw budhan singh pw $$$ pw0 $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ and pw $$$. hence rest of the evidence is not required to be discussed. apart from these witnesses to prove the injuries to the dead and injured witnesses the prosecution has examined doctors namely pw dr. kapildeo prasad $$$. $$$ pw dr. arjun singh and pw dr. mukti nath singh. $$$ counsel for the appellants -accused has not disputed the injuries caused to the deceased or to the witnesses therefore that aspect is not required to be dealt with in this appeal. mr. u.r. $$$ and mr. $$$ senior counsel appearing on behalf of accused mainly submitted that--. the identification of the accused is not reliable ;. even if it is held that accused were present in the mob of -persons there is no justifiable reasons for connecting the accused with the crime;. no witness has stated that accused were armed with any deadly weapons;. no witness has stated that any of the accused took part in murder of any of the deceased or of causing any injury to any witness or setting fire to the houses;. there is no recovery of any arms or any incriminating articles from any of the accused;. the statements of witnesses are recorded after long lapse of time mostly after more than -days;. all the witnesses are got up witnesses. n of the witnesses stated that accused were members of maoists community center an extremist group;. in any set of circumstances presuming that accused are identified but mere presence in the mob would not justify imposition of death sentence. the evidence of witnesses who identified the accused before the court can be divided as it is the say of pw belmati devi that before when they were sleeping they heard bullets and guns booming. some terrorists broke open their doors and entered into the house. they took her husband whose both hands were burnt along with them. the militants were holding torches and were shouting long live red salute and whoever comes in our way would be eliminated. after her attention was drawn to police statement she stated that she could identify $$$ nand lal $$$ $$$ and $$$ all residents of $$$ $$$. $$$ in the cross -examination she admitted that militants came in police uniform and that they were unknown persons. she had not seen militants or naxalities earlier or subsequent to the incident. she denied the suggestion that she had not stated before the police that militants took her husband in their laps and they were shouting slogans. she also admitted that she had not stated before the police about identifying $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$. in view of aforesaid admissions no reliance can be placed upon her evidence to connect any accused with the crime. pw birender singh after narrating the facts has stated that on $$$$ of incident the militants took them to a place near the canal under the bridge. the militants were cutting the throats by a pasuli. mahinder ravi das $$$ and $$$ das were amongst the militants. he was hit by pasuli on the neck he fell down and the militants left him untouched thinking that he was dead. the names of the persons to whom he identified were given to the police. he again stated that $$$ mahender ravi das $$$ $$$ $$$ alias $$$ $$$ alias $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ dharo singh ramashish mahto suraj pandit $$$ rajender paswan $$$ were amongst the militants. he could identify only $$$ a-$$$$ who was present in the mob and stated that since a long time has lapsed he can not identify others. it is his say in the cross -examination that the persons whose names he has mentid were seen by him $$$$ and that some of the militants used to come to work in their houses. it is his say that after he returned from hospital his statement was recorded after days of the occurrence. however pw investigating officer $$$ has specifically stated that witness did not name $$$ among the accused persons in his police statement. hence no reliance can be placed on evidence of this witness to connect any of the accused with the crime. pw $$$ stated that the incident is of about -years old. the militants surrendered their village and they were armed with guns and ammunition. the incident took place at p. the militants entered into their house by breaking the door. $$$ the militants she could identify krishna $$$ bhugal and $$$. her statement was recorded after days. she however stated that since her eye -sight has become weak she can not identify anybody. even though this witness had named $$$ a-$$$$ and $$$ a- but as she could not identify any of the accused in the $$$ her evidence is of no value.evidence against appellant no. $$$ a-$$$$)-$$$$. for identification of this accused there is evidence of pw$$$$ $$$ pw and pw0. $$$ is another injured witness. it is his say that on.between.and.p. extremists raided their house. he was sleeping along with his brothers $$$ $$$ and mithilesh singh and guests nagender singh satender singh s / o $$$. all of a sudden they heard the noise of bullets and bombs. the people of the village started running here and there. vidya budhan singh of their village came and did himself in their house. the extremists armed with the weapons attacked his house. when he went out of his house he saw that there was fire everywhere. the extremists broke open the doors of their house entered the house and tied their hands. $$$ the extremists took them to the canal and there they saw that a number of residents of the village were already present there and the extremists were surrounding them. after reaching there they saw muneshwar singh siaram singh ashudev singh and $$$ of their village were being brought by the extremists. their hands were also tied at the back. then the extremists brought some villagers from the mandir. $$$ they started tying their legs with the help of dhoti and ghamchi. $$$ the extremists started slitting their throats. his throat was also slit. he stated that he can identify the accused who were slitting the throats. among those persons there were $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ @ $$$ and $$$. further $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ were also present at the scene of offence. however he could identify only $$$ a-$$$$ and $$$ a- out of accused present in the court but could not identify other accused because of passage of time. he also stated that the accused identified by him were of tola $$$ of village $$$ and that they used to work in agricultural land as labourers. it is his say in the cross -examination that he stayed in magadh medical college hospital for days because of injuries on throat and leg. it was also suggested to him in cross -examination that he had named the other accused falsely because of the politics of village and that he had not identified any of the accused all the time of occurrence. from the evidence of this witness it appears that he had named number of persons but thereafter could identify only persons. hence there was no reason for the witness to say that he could identify the other accused persons whom he has named. this would indicate that he falsely deposed to a large extent involving number of persons. further this witness has not stated $$$ 's name in part of his statement. name of $$$ is given only as a person who was present at the scene of occurrence. $$$ stated that militants were armed with rifles guns and bullets they burnt the entire village and that he can identify $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ who were amongst the militants. however he could identify only $$$ and $$$ present in the court. it is his say in cross -examination that he saw militants from the top of the roof. he denied the suggestion that there was a long standing dispute between him and $$$ and $$$ and therefore he has falsely implicated them. next witness is pw $$$ who also stated that extremists started slitting their throats and he was attacked with pasuli as a result of which his left ear and throat were slit. he became unconscious and gained consciousness at medical college hospital. after regaining consciousness he informed the police about accused persons which included $$$ chamar $$$ paswan $$$ ramashish mahto dharo singh @ dharmender singh $$$ mahender ravi das $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ suraj pandit $$$ $$$ $$$ @ bhola ji vinod singh $$$ rajinder paswan. $$$ he stated that he can identify the persons whose names he has stated. he wrongly identified $$$ and $$$ paswan. however he identified $$$ correctly and thereafter he stated that it was difficult to identify accused after years. in cross -examination to the suggestion given to him that he did not give names of $$$ and $$$ to the police he stated that he gave their names to the police and if the police did not record their names he was not knowing about it. he further denied the suggestion that there was long pending dispute about a passage through his and dharo singh 's village. he has also denied the suggestion that there was a dispute between him and $$$ and therefore he had named him. similarly pw0 $$$ has stated that among the extremists there were $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ naresh $$$ $$$ $$$. $$$ and $$$ whom he had identified. it is his further say that satendra singh the informant was member of his family. he could identify only krishna $$$ in the $$$ and wrongly identified $$$. he stated that because of long lapse of time there has been a change and therefore it was difficult for him to identify them. a suggestion was given to him in the cross -examination that there was a long standing dispute with regard to construction of road. he stated that he had not suffered any injury and that is statement was recorded after days of the incident. he further stated that accused $$$ and krishna $$$ belong to $$$ and other accused belong to various other villages. he denied the suggestion that he had not named the militants who entered in his house. from the aforesaid evidence it would be apparent that almost all witnesses have named number of persons but have failed to identify them. only or accused are identified in the court. their identification parade was not held by the police. however at the most it can be said that pw$$$$ and pw have identified $$$ and a- $$$ pw and pw0 have identified $$$.evidence against appellant no. $$$ @ dharo singh a-)-. pw $$$ after narrating the facts of the incident stated that he saw mahender ravi das $$$ bhugal $$$ $$$ @ surya $$$ janeshwar $$$ @ $$$ $$$ dharmender singh @ dharo singh. he identified $$$ @ dharo singh in the $$$. he wrongly identified $$$ as $$$. he stated that since a lot of time has lapsed he is unable to identify $$$. even though this witness had identified a- in the dock but his statement can not be relied on the ground that pw io $$$ has specifically stated that this witness did not name a- dharo singh @ dharmender singh in his statement given to the police. $$$$ $$$ after narrating story stated that at the time of incident he could identify $$$ $$$ bhugal $$$ rajender paswan $$$ paswan dharo singh @ dharmender singh suraj pandit $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ and $$$ and that he was not remembering names of other persons to whom he identified there. in the $$$ he could identify only a- $$$ paswan a- dharo singh @ dharmender singh and a- $$$. as stated above no reliance can be placed on the evidence of pw. the evidence of $$$$ shows that he had named number of persons seen by him at the scene of offence but in the $$$ he could identify only accused including a-.evidence against appellant no. $$$ a-)-. for identification of this accused there is evidence of pw$$$$ $$$ pw$$$$ $$$ and pw. pw$$$$ and $$$ have identified a-. their evidence is dealt with above. pw$$$$ budhan singh stated that at the time of offence he saw militant took out pasuli and slit the neck of his son $$$ $$$ and $$$. he saw about persons involved in slitting the throats of the people assembled there by using pasuli. he became unconscious. it is his say that police recorded his statement and that amongst the militants there were $$$ $$$ and bhugal whom he identified. in the court he identified $$$ by going close to him. in cross -examination it was suggested to him that he had not given the name of $$$ to the police and that he had not identified anybody. he denied the suggestion that because of an old animosity with $$$ he gave his name in the case. $$$ has also identified this witness and his evidence is dealt with above. next witness is pw kishna devi. after narrating the prosecution story she stated that persons who had been killed and injured belonged to bhumihar community and that she had given the names of certain extremists but as long time had lapsed she can not give their names and was having difficulty in identifying them. however she identified $$$. she deemed the suggestion that she had not given the name of $$$ to the police amongst the persons who were present at the scene of offence. from the evidence of the aforesaid witnesses it is apparent that despite naming number of persons they could identify only or persons in the $$$ and gave the reason that due to lapse of long time they were not able to identify the others.evidence against appellant no. $$$ paswan a-)-. for identification of this accused there is evidence of pw $$$ and $$$ $$$. pw $$$ also narrated the prosecution version and thereafter stated that among the people who were slitting throats were mohinder mochi $$$ $$$ bir kunwar paswan rajinder paswan $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ @ suraj $$$ and lot of other people whose names he was not knowing. however in the $$$ he could identify bir kunwar paswan and stated that he can not identify others. in the cross -examination he stated that he had seen the accused only on the date of occurrence and that is why he had taken their names. he also used to see those people in market and used to hear their names. he further stated that $$$ paswan was not working in his village as labourer. he clarified that when militants entered his house he became unconscious and regained consciousness at medical college hospital. $$$ has also identified this accused and his evidence has been dealt with above. pw could identify only a- and pw could identify a- a- and a-. likewise both the witnesses named number of persons but could not identify all the named persons.in such state of evidence the question would be who could be convicted and what sentence could be awarded?. this $$$ in kamaksha rai and ors. v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/0$$$$/$$$ / sc/0$$$$/ dealt with the incident where large number of people exceeding in number were alleged to have taken part in attacking backward class persons by upper class and observed that considering the nature of the attack and the possibility or otherwise of the identification of these accused persons by the prosecution witnesses and bearing in mind the principles laid down by this $$$ in masalti v. state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ which was followed in binay kumar singh v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/00$$$$$$$$/$$$ / sc/00$$$$$$$$/ it is not sale to rely on he evidence of witnesses who speak generally and in an omnibus way without specific reference to the identity of the individuals and their specific overt acts in regard to the incident that took place in the harijan basti. the $$$ also observed that as a rule of prudence it is necessary to fix a minimum number of witnesses needed to accept the prosecution case to base a conviction. the decision in masalti 's case supra enunciating rule of caution is well established law uniformly followed all throughout. re baddi venkata narasayya and ors. v. state of a.p. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ state of a.p. v. thukkidiram reddy and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ and $$$ and ors. v. state of rajasthan $$$ / sc/0/000$$$ / sc/0/000. the aforesaid rule of prudence is also required to be applied in the present case. as discussed above a- $$$ alias dharo singh is identified by only pw. there is no other corroborative piece of evidence connecting the said accused with the crime. hence he is required to be given benefit of doubt. for identification of rest of the accused i. a- $$$ paswan $$$ and a- $$$ there is evidence of or more witnesses. however from the evidence discussed above it can be stated as under--( it is apparent that the investigation in the present case is totally defective. the investigating officers have not taken any care and caution of recording the statement of witnesses immediately. no identification parade of accused was held. investigating officer is not examined. as observed by this $$$ in $$$ and ors. v. state of bihar $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ crilj$$$$0 it should not be forgotten that the duty of the instigating officers is not merely to bolster up a prosecution case with such evidence as may enable the $$$ to record a conviction but to bring out the real unvarnished truth. in the said case the $$$ has also observed where neither the prosecution nor the defence come out with the whole and unvarnished truth to enable the $$$ to judge where the rights and wrongs of the set of incidents lay the courts can only try to guess or conjecture to decipher the truth if possible. but this may be d within limits to determine whether any reasonable doubt emerges on any point under consideration from proved facts and circumstances of the case. further this $$$ in kishore chand v. state of himachal pradesh $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0 observed that indulging in free fabrication of the record is a deplorable conduct on the part of an investigating officer which undermines the public confidence reposed in the investigating agency. therefore greater case and circumspection are needed by the investigating agency in this regard. it is time that the investigating agencies evolve new and scientific investigating methods taking aid of rapid scientific development in the field of investigation. it is also the duty of the state i. central or state governments to organise periodical refresher courses for the investigating officers to keep them abreast of the latest scientific development in the art of investigation and the march of law so that the real offence would be brought to book and the innocent would not be exposed to prosecution.it is also settled law that when accused are charged with heinous brutal murders punishable to the highest penalty prescribed by the penal code the judicial approach in dealing with such cases has to be cautious circumspect and careful. in case of defective investigation the $$$ can rely upon the evidence led by the prosecution and connect the accused with the crime if found reliable and trusrthy. in dilavar hussain v. state of gujarat $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ this $$$ dealt with a communal riot case which was considered by the court as tragic trauma of ghastly inhuman and beastly behavior of community against another where burning looting and killing became the order of $$$$ and observed--"but sentiments or emotions howsoever strong are neither relevant nor have any place in a court of law. acquittal or conviction depends on proof or otherwise of the criminological chain which invariably comprises of why where when how and who...$$$ also prevailed about appreciation of evidence. without adverting to submissions suffice it to mention that credibility of witnesses has to be measured with same yardstick whether it is ordinary crime or a crime emanating due to communal frenzy. $$$ does not make any distinction either in leading of evidence or in its assessment. rule is and only namely whether depositions are hst and true...in the present case it can be said without any doubt that almost all witnesses have exaggerated to a large extent by naming number of persons as accused but they could identify only or accused. this would clearly reveal that for or other reason witnesses were naming number of persons as accused who were not known to them or whom they had not seen at the time of incident. in that set of circumstances their evidence to a large extent becomes doubtful and/or tutored.nowhere the witnesses assign any specific role to the accused except their presence in the mob at the time of offence.the witnesses nowhere state that identified accused were having any weapon of offence.investigating officers have not recovered any weapon of offence or any incriminating article from the possession of any of the accused. in view of the aforesaid short -comings in the investigation and the evidence which only proves the presence of the accused at the scene of offence this would not be a fit case for imposing the death penalty. in the result appeal filed by appellant no. $$$ alias dharo singh a- is allowed he is acquitted of the charges for which he was facing trial and is ordered to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. appeal filed by the remaining accused i. by appellant no. $$$ a-$$$$ appellant no. $$$ a- and appellant no. $$$ paswan a- is partly allowed their conviction is upheld however imposition of death penalty is altered to life imprisonment. appeal stands disposed -of accordingly. for the reasons stated above. death reference filed by the state of bihar is dismissed.b.n. agrawal j. this is an unfortunate case of a gruesome carnage on the holy land of $$$ within the district of $$$ in the state of bihar where he got enlightenment wherein persons of a community which was the most powerful in the state at point of time and ruled bihar for $$$$ have been massacre with the unholy alliance of members of another community leading to more or less an outburst of caste war between haves and have nots. this appeal has been directed against judgment rendered by sessions judge $$$ -cum -designated $$$ under terrorist and disruptive activities prevention act hereinafter referred to as the tada act whom of them namely $$$ accused no. $$$ accused no. have been acquitted whereas the appellants viz.$$$ appellant no. accused no. $$$$) $$$ @ dharo singh- appellant no. accused no. $$$ appellant no. accused no. and $$$ paswan @ $$$ dusadh -appellant no. accused no. have been convicted under sections of the indian penal code in short penal code and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life. they have been further convicted under section of the tada act and awarded death sentence and the proceedings have been submitted to this $$$ for confirmation. $$$ accused no. $$$ @ lakhan dusadh accused no. $$$ accused no. and $$$ accused no. have been convicted under section 0/ of the penal code and section of the tada act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life on each count. however sentences have been ordered to run concurrently. out of these accused persons accused nos. and have filed separate appeal before this $$$ bearing $$$ no. of whereas accused no. has filed $$$ no. of which though have been heard together but are being disposed of by a separate judgment. ravindra singh accused no. has been convicted under section of the tada act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for years but he has not preferred any appeal. in this case there was gruesome carnage in which members of particular community in the state of bihar lost their lives and the prosecution case as disclosed in the fard beyan of $$$ recorded in is that in about.p.he was about to go to bed all of a sudden upon hearing sound of indiscriminate firing and explosion of bombs he became terrorised and found the village ablaze. in the meantime a mob consisting of to unknown persons arrived at this house and started knocking at the door violently. of such persons stated that they had come to apprehend dayanand and $$$ as according to their information both of them were in of houses of that village. upon this the informant opened the door out of fear and those unknown persons took him near the temple situated on the north eastern flank of the village where he found his father uncles and brothers amongst others. all these persons were kept with their hands tied on the back. some to unknown persons being variously armed were guarding the villagers. hands of the informant were also tied and he was also made to sit there. the unknown terrorists formed several groups each consisting of to persons. each group used to go to village and bring the villagers. in presence of the informant $$$ @ nawkesh singh lal singh budhan singh $$$ and ramakant singh were also brought from village. of the terrorists was stating that no male members should be left alive in the village. in the meantime female folk including wife of parishan singh ramesh singh nagina singh and lakhan singh arrived there weeping. at that time $$$ mithilesh singh ekbal singh $$$ and awadhesh singh were also brought and their hands were also tied. at that time to terrorist including $$$ $$$ bhugal mochi arrived there and stated that their leader $$$ had directed to take all the villagers bear the bridge on the canal. terrorist who was being addressed as $$$ asked the female folk to go to their houses $$$ the villagers were taken bear the canal where they were kept confined with their hands and legs tied. in the meantime the informant heard sound of firing coming from western side of the village and in the light of the fire he identified several accused persons including the appellants naming all of them. the terrorists skittered the villagers by cutting their neck with the help of pasuli which is a sharp cutting weapon. in the mean time the terrorists having guessed arrival of the police started fleeing away whereby anyhow the informant could save his life. the police with informant went to the place of occurrence and found persons named in the fard beyan dead and some persons having serious injuries who were immediately sent to hospital for treatment. it has been alleged in the fard beyan that the terrorists were armed with police rifles and some of them were in police uniform. the terrorists were about in number out of which about to persons were armed. when they made their retreat they shouted slogan of maoist community center hereinafter referred to as m.c.c.$$$. the terrorists were taking among themselves that they had come to annihilate persons belonging to particular community which was object of the unlawful assembly and they wanted to strike terror in that community. on the basis of the said fard beyan police instituted a case under sections and of the penal code and section of criminal laws amendment act besides sections and of tada act. during investigation the police arrested many persons and confessional statement of accused $$$ was recorded by the superintendent of police $$$ making self inculpatory statement implicating himself and several other accused persons including appellants of the other appeals in the crime. upon completion of investigation the police submitted charge sheet against persons showing them as absconders besides accused persons whose cases were separated and they were put on trial. defence of the accused persons was that they were innocent and had no complicity with the crime but have been falsely implicated in the case on hand. during trial the prosecution examined witnesses and upon conclusion of the same by the impugned order accused persons named above have been acquitted whereas the remaining including the appellants have been convicted as stated above. hence the present appeal. in order t prove the massacre of persons the prosecution has examined doctors namely dr. kapildeo prasad pw dr. $$$ pw dr. arjun singh pw and dr. mukti nath singh pw who held postmortem examinations on the dead bodies of different persons and found incised injuries in front of the neck caused by pasuli which is a sharp cutting weapon. the doctors also found that some of the deceased died due to fire arm injuries. the postmortem examination was conducted within of the occurrence and the time which elapsed between the time of death and post mortem examination as found by doctors was consistent with the time of occurrence and support the prosecution case. in order to prove its case that the accused persons belonged to m.c.c.their intention was to create terror in the minds of persons belonging to a particular community in bihar and to achieve that end they used bombs dynamites fire arms lethal weapons besides sharp cutting weapon pasuli and massacred members of a particular community and injured several persons after surrounding them prosecution examined $$$ pw $$$ pw belmati devi pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$$) $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw budhan singh pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw as witnesses and upon consideration thereof the trial court came to the conclusion that there was a gruesome carnage which conclusion could be neither assailed by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants nor i find any infirmity in the well reasd judgment by the designated $$$ on this count. shri u.r. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in support of the appeal submitted that the prosecution has failed to prove the participation of the appellants in the crime by credible evidence. $$$ counsel further submitted that it is a fit case in which benefit of doubt should be given to the appellants as informant was not examined as such the information report can not be used as substantive evidence. it has been also submitted that names of n of the appellants find place in the confessional statement said to have been made by co -accused bihari manjhi before the superintendent of police $$$ the investigating officer $$$ has not been examined no incriminating articles could be recovered from the appellants identification of the appellants was not possible in the dead of and the appellants were not the assailants but mere sight seers. $$$ counsel in the alternative submitted that in any view of the matter it was not a fit case for awarding the extreme penalty of death. on the other hand shri h.l. agrawal learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the state submitted that the prosecution has succeeded in proving its case and complicity of the appellants with the crime by unimpeachable evidence and there was no infirmity in their convictions and sentence of death awarded against the appellants was in accordance with law as the present case falls in the category of rarest of the rare. thus this $$$ is called upon to examine in this appeal evidence showing complicity of the appellants with the crime and consider their cases individually. all the appellants who were accused nos. and in the present trial were named in the information report. $$$ appellant no. accused no. 8) is said to have been identified by prosecution witnesses namely belmati devi pw $$$ pw $$$ pw 8) $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw. belmati devi pw stated in her very examination -in -chief that she could not identify any of the accused persons which obviously means this accused as well though she stated that she disclosed name of this appellant before the police as of the accused who participated in the occurrence but in her cross examination this witness resiled from the statement aforesaid made in the examination -in -chief as she admitted that she did not disclose name of the appellant before the police. $$$ pw claims in $$$ for the time after years from the date of the alleged occurrence that the identified this appellant as of the persons who participated in the alleged occurrence he having not identified this appellant before the police as would appear from the statement of investigating officer $$$ pw inasmuch as the occurrence is said to have taken place on th february and the witness was examined on th april. thus the evidence of belmati devi pw and $$$ pw on the question of participation of this appellant can not be of any avail to the prosecution. $$$ pw 8) who was an injured witness and resident of the village of occurrence claims to have witnessed the entire occurrence as during night when he was inside the house the accused persons entered the house after breaking open the door tied hands of this witness as well as his family members and they were taken near the canal where he found other villagers were already surrounded by accused persons and some more being brought with their hands tied. the accused persons thereafter got some other villagers from the temple and they tied their legs as well as of this witness and his family members inasmuch as started slitting their throats. immediately after the occurrence when the police arrived at the village if found this witness lying on the ground with bleeding injuries. this witness together with other injured persons and the dead bodies was shifted to the hospital. this witness had to remain in the hospital for days where the police recorded his statement. he identified this accused as of the persons who participated in the occurrence. it has been submitted that no reliance should be placed on the evidence of this witness as he was examined by the police after days. but i do not find any material in support of this submission as neither this witness nor anybody else has anywhere stated that police recorded his statement after days rather on the other hand from the evidence of this witness it appears that he was examined by the police in the hospital itself. it would appear that he was a natural witness as he was resident of the same village the accused persons broke open the door of his house took him and his family members away from the house after tying their hands and the family members along with others were slittered to death before arrival of police which found this witness lying on the ground with bleeding injuries whereafter he was shifted to the hospital and there the police recorded his statement. this would go to show that the witness was examined by the police in the hospital immediately after he was shifted there. this being the position i do not find any ground to disbelieve this witness. $$$ pw who was also resident of village of occurrence stated that at the time of the alleged occurrence when he was at his house upon hearing sound of firing and heavy explosion from the western side of the village he opened the door came out of his house along with his family members and found about people standing at some distance from his house and seeing this witness of the accused persons shouted at him whereupon he ran to the house of hari singh and climbed on the roof from where he had seen that the accused persons where passing through the streets after setting fire to houses in the entire village. accused persons were armed with rifles and guns and amongst them he identified this appellant as well in the light of the fire which was set in the village by the accused persons. he has consistently supported the prosecution case that all the accused persons including this appellant as well as appellant no. $$$ entered the village with fire arms and set the entire village of fire but nothing could be pointed out on behalf of the defence to disbelieve his evidence. $$$ pw who was another injured person and resident of the village of occurrence stated that on th february when he was sleeping in his house with his brothers in at about.o'clock sounds of explosion of bombs from all sides of village were heard and immediately thereafter his brother $$$ went out from the house for hiding himself in the house of a villager but before this witness could take shelter in the house of another villager a bomb was thrown on the house making pace for the accused persons to enter the same and thereafter they did enter the house with deadly weapons. the hands of this witness and his brothers were tied and thereafter they were taken to the temple where some people had already been brought from the eastern side of the village whose hands had also been tied and these persons were also made to sit there. $$$ all those persons including this witness and his family members whose hands were tied were taken to a bridge upon the canal where many other villagers were made to sit and there the accused persons started slitting their throats with pasuli as a result of which left ear and throat of this witness were slittered and he became unconscious as a result of the injuries inflicted. after the regained consciousness on $$$$ he was examined by the police immediately and before whom he disclosed names of the accused persons including this appellant as persons who have participated in the present occurrence on the fateful right. he has categorically stated that he knew this accused from much before the date of the alleged occurrence. $$$ counsel appearing on behalf of the accused persons could not point out any infirmity in the evidence of this witness so as to reject his sworn testimony. $$$ pw is also resident of the village of occurrence and he stated that on the fateful night when he was sleeping in his house with brothers he heard sounds of firing and bomb explosion immediately where after the accused persons including this appellant as well as appellant no. whom he identified after breaking open the door of his house entered the same and took them after tying their hands to the canal where their legs were also tied and there the accused persons started slitting the throats of the helpless persons whose hands and legs were tied. thereafter some people were shot dead on the southern side of the canal. he has also stated that the accused persons were shouting the slogans ' long live mcc and whoever would come in their way would be d to death.this witness was examined by the police days after the occurrence and it can not be said that there was inordinate delay in recording his statement in the facts and circumstances of this case as it was a case of caste war wherein persons of community having been massacred and several injured there was great commotion and several villagers had to be examined. $$$ counsel appearing on behalf of the accused persons could not point out any infirmity in the evidence of this witness. last witness on the question of participation of this appellant is $$$ pw. this witness though stated that she could identify this appellant but could not identify him in $$$ due to very weak eye sight. thus the evidence of this witness on the participation of this appellant can be of no avail to the prosecution. this being the position i have no difficulty in holding that the participation of this appellant in the crime has been proved by credible evidence of $$$ pw 8) $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw though it is not possible to place reliance upon the evidence of belmati devi pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw. turning now to the participation of appellant no. -dharmenda singh @ dharo singh accused no. it may be stated that he is said to have been identified by $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw. so far as $$$ pw is concerned this witness has named him for the time in session $$$ after and a half years from the date of alleged occurrence as according to the evidence of investigating officer $$$ pw the witness did not disclose the name of the appellant in his statement made before the police inasmuch as no explanation could be furnished by the prosecution for such a non disclosure. this being the position it is not safe to place reliance upon the evidence of this witness in relation to participation of this appellant.$$$ pw though claimed that he identified this appellant but when he was asked to identify the appellant in $$$ he wrongly identified this appellant as accused $$$ @ $$$ and not $$$ @ dharo singh. thus the evidence of this witness in relation to participation of this appellant in the crime can not be acted upon. last witness on the participation of this appellant in the crime is $$$ pw. this witness was a resident of village of occurrence and on the date of occurrence when he was at his house with his family members he heard sounds of bomb explosion and firing of bullets in he village and immediately thereafter his house was attacked and this witness and his family members went to the adjoining house belonging to $$$ for hiding themselves where persons had already taken shelter. the accused persons went to said house and shouted that if the doors were not opened the same would be blasted by bombs and saying so they started throwing the bombs whereupon the female inmates had no option but to open the doors. the accused persons thereafter entered the house and took away the mala members after tying their hands near the temple where to persons were already made to sit from before from where this witness and his family members and others were taken near the canal. there other accused persons had already assembled from before. this witness claimed to have identified this appellant and appellant no. kuer paswan. there the accused persons started slitting the throat of the helpless persons including this witness. there was a stampede and some of the persons who were brought there for slitting tried to flee away resulting into firing by the accused persons causing death of persons. thereupon accused persons declared that from amongst the persons brought there those who were members of communities other than the targeted were set free and upon this the witness also intentionally declared himself to be of member of another community and thereby could rescue himself. the other persons who belonged to community including father uncle and brothers of this witness were slittered to death by causing injuries by pasuli. the accused persons were shouting slogans ' long live mcc and anybody who comes in their way would be destroyed.this witness was examined by the police in the hospital where he had g to receive the dead bodies of his family members on of the occurrence. the witness identified this appellant as well as accused $$$ appellant no. accused no. and $$$ paswan @ $$$ dusadh -appellant no. accused no. so far as this appellant is concerned the witness in his cross -examination pretended that he was not known to him from before the incident although it was admitted by him that this appellant had agriculture land in the village of occurrence which is at a distance of and a half kilometers away from his land. as suggestion was given to this witness that there was animosity between them on account of the land dispute as a result of which this appellant was falsely implicated which clearly shows that the witness was very well known to this appellant from much before the date of the alleged occurrence. in my view this witness has stood the tests of cross -examination and thee is nothing to discredit his testimony as he was quite natural witness and consistently supported the participation of this appellant in the crime with all material particulars. thus so far appellant no. is concerned ut of the witnesses it is not possible to place reliance on the evidence of $$$ pw and $$$ pw but the evidence of $$$ pw is unimpeachable and he can be treated to be a sterling witness for the prosecution. now i proceed to consider the case of $$$ appellant no. accused no. who is said to have been identified by $$$ pw 8) $$$ pw budhan singh pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw. out of the aforesaid witnesses $$$ pw 8) has duly identified this appellant and i do not find any ground to disbelieve his evidence in relation to participation of this appellant as well in the crime for the reasons enumerated while considering his evidence in relation to appellant no. mochi. $$$ pw claimed to have identified this accused from the roof top and i have considered the evidence of this witness in detail and found the same credible while appreciating the case of appellant no. mochi. in my view evidence of this witness in relation to participation of this appellant as well is free from any doubt. budhan singh pw was a resident of the village of occurrence. at the time of incident when he was in the cattle shed he heard sound of bomb explosion and simultaneously accused persons who were in police uniforms came there and told him that they had g there to arrest this witness. the sons of this witness who were also there succeeded in fleeing away but the accused persons tied the hands of this witness on the back and took him near the temple. he claimed to have identified the accused persons including this appellant in the light of the fire which was lit in the stack of harvested crop kept there and from there this witness along with others was taken to the canal where his legs were also tied. in the mean time somebody blew the whistle and said that the police had arrived. the witness stated that in the mean time of his sons were slittered to death and seeing this he got perplexed and remained standing there as a silent spectator. he was examined by the police on $$$$ of the incident as would appear from his evidence. in this connection reference is made to the statement of $$$ pw who at the relevant time was police inspector and posted as station incharge of tekari police station within which the village of occurrence falls. during the course of cross -examination this witness has stated the reasons why on the date of occurrence and on $$$$ the statements of many witnesses could not be recorded as they were not in a position to give their statements in view of the fact that they were busy in performing the last rites of their family members who were slittered to death and relatives of the persons who died were not in a mental condition to make statement. further the witness stated that there were visits of various political leaders in the locality as a result of which law and order condition had become complicated. according to the witness the statement of other witnesses could not be recorded due to the aforesaid reasons which were beyond the control of the police. so far as budhan singh pw is concerned of his sons were slittered to death in the present occurrence and in view of the aforesaid facts if his statement could not be recorded by the police on the date of occurrence as well as on $$$$ but on $$$$ it can not be said that there was inordinate delay in recording the statement of this witness. this being the position i do not find any infirmity in the evidence of this witness in relation to participation of this appellant in the crime. $$$ pw also claimed to have identified this appellant but in $$$ he wrongly identified this appellant as rajinder paswan. similarly $$$ pw has wrongly identified accused nand lal mochi as this appellant. thus the evidence of $$$ pw and $$$ pw can be of no avail of the prosecution to show participation of this appellant in the crime. $$$ pw identified this appellant and there is no reason to discard his evidence on the question of participation of this appellant in the crime for the reasons detailed hereinabove while considering the evidence of this witness in relation to appellant no. singh @ dharo singh accused no.. $$$ pw who is also a resident of the village of occurrence and an eye witness to the occurrence inasmuch as at the time of the occurrence when she was at her house the accused persons came there and had broken the door open after setting the house on fire. the accused persons are said to have taken away her father -in -law and brother -in -law to the temple where they were make to sit and after some time they were taken near the canal along with others. when the lady went near the temple she was asked by the accused persons to go back to her house. thereafter upon hearing slogans of the accused persons this witness and other lady witness went towards the canal where this witness claimed to have seen the accused persons slitting to death along with others her father -in -law with pasuli. she also stated that persons were slittered to death and to were injured all of whom belonged to community. the witness identifies this accused as having participated in the occurrence. the witness was examined by police days after the incident from which it can not be inferred that there was inordinate delay in her examination by the police for the reasons enumerated while considering the evidence of budhan singh pw. $$$ pw though claimed to have identified this accused but could not identify him on account of very weak eye sight at the time of his examination in $$$. therefore no reliance can be placed on the evidence of such a witness. thus the point of participation of this appellant out of the evidence of $$$ pw 8) $$$ pw budhan singh pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw the evidence of $$$ pw 8) $$$ pw budhan singh pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw is unimpeachable whereas no reliance can be placed upon the statements of $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw. coming now to the participation of the last appellant namely $$$ paswan @ $$$ dusadh appellant no. accused no. it may be stated that this appellant according to the prosecution was identified by $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw. out of the aforesaid witnesses $$$ pw who was also of the injured and was resident of the village of occurrence stated that at the time of occurrence when he was sleeping in the outer verandah of his house after having heard the sounds of firing and explosion of bombs started fleeing away. in the mean time the accused persons came armed with fire arms set fire in the heap of straw which was kept outside the house after breaking open the door of the house entered the same and took away his brother and sons along with him to the temple where there were other accused persons and all of them surrounded the villagers who had already been brought there from different directions of the village. thereupon the accused persons took the aforesaid persons towards the canal after surrounding them and they were made to sit near the canal after tying their hands and legs. the accused persons slittered to death several persons with pasuli and inflicted injuries with pasuli on the throat of this witness as a result of which he fell down. this witness claimed to have identified this appellant. he stated that he remained hospitalised in magadh medical college for days and the police recorded his statement. it has been submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that this witness was examined by the police after days for which there is no foundation as this witness has nowhere stated that he was examined after days of the alleged occurrence nor there is any other evidence to this effect. rather it appears from the evidence of this witness that he was examined by the police in the hospital itself. $$$ counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants pointed out that during the course of cross -examination in paragraph of his evidence the witness admitted that after the accused persons entered the house upon breaking open the door the became unconscious and regained consciousness in the hospital. therefore it can not be said that he witnessed anything after the accused persons entered the house. i have perused paragraph of the statement of this witness from which it appears that after the accused persons entered the house upon breaking open the door the witness was so much terrified that he became completely nonplussed and regained normalcy by the time he arrived at the hospital. thus i do not find any ground to reject testimony of the witness on the point of participation of this appellant in the crime. $$$ pw though claimed that he identified this appellant but the wrongly identified bihari manjhi as this appellant. thus the evidence of this witness can not be used to show complicity of this appellant with the crime. last witness on the question of participation of this appellant is $$$ pw. this witness claimed to have identified this appellant and on the point of participation of this appellant there is nothing to doubt the credibility of the witness especially in view of the grounds mentid while considering the evidence of this witness in relation to the appellant no. singh @ dharo singh accused no. thus out of the witnesses namely $$$ pw $$$ pw and $$$ pw on the question of participation of this appellant in the crime no reliance can be placed on the evidence of $$$ pw but i do not find any infirmity in the evidence of $$$ pw and $$$ pw. from the above it would be plain that in relation to appellant no. evidence of witnesses appellant no. witness appellant no. witnesses appellant no. witness has been found credible. it has been submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that though in ordinary case trusrthy evince of a solitary witness may be enough to convict an accused but where a criminal court has to deal with evidence pertaining to the commission of an offence involving a large number of offenders and large number of victims like the present it is usual to adopt the test that the conviction could be sustained only if it is supported by or or more witnesses who give a consistent account of the incident inasmuch as in the present case as far as appellant no. is concerned evidence of only witnesses and in relation to appellant no. evidence of only witnesses has been found to be credible. in support of his submission learned counsel has heavily relied upon a bench decision of this $$$ in the case of masalti v. the state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/007/6$$$ / sc/007/6. that was a case in which persons were murdered accused were put on trial and the prosecution examined eye -witnesses in support of its case. out of accused persons were acquitted by the trial court and convicted under sections of the indian penal code. out of the persons convicted accused persons were sentenced to death whereas remaining were awarded imprisonment for life. when the matter was taken in appeal to the high $$$ of allahabad out of the eye -witnesses were disbelieved and reliance was placed upon the remaining. the high $$$ confirmed conviction of only those accused persons against whom of more eye -witnesses had given a consistent account of the incident and by adopting this test accused persons were acquitted as the number of eye -witnesses in relation to them was less than. the high $$$ however maintained the conviction of the remaining accused persons out of whom persons appealed to this $$$ and their conviction was upheld by this $$$ also. it may be stated that against the order of acquittal no appeal was preferred by the state. on these facts it was contended on behalf of the accused persons whose conviction was upheld by the high $$$ that the $$$ was no justified in upholding the conviction by mechanically evolving a formula that or more witnesses had given a consistent account of the incident in relation to them. in that light to meet the submission gajendragadkar c.j.speaking for the $$$ observed in paragraph at page thus:-...where a criminal court has to deal with evidence pertaining to the commission of an offence involving a large number of offenders and a large number of victims it is usual to adopt the test that the conviction could be sustained only if it is supported by or or more witnesses who give a consistent account of the incident. in a sense the test may be described as mechanical but it is difficult to see how it can be treated as irrational or unreasonable. therefore we do not think that any grievance can be made by the appellants against the adoption of this test. if at all the prosecution may be entitled to say that the accused persons were acquitted because their cases did not satisfy the mechanical test of witnesses and if the said test had not been applied they might as well have been convicted. it is no doubt the quality of the evidence that matters and not the number of witnesses who give such evidence. but sometimes it is useful to adopt a test like the which the high $$$ has adopted in dealing with the present case.emphasis added]7. thus it appears that this $$$ laid down that in the matter of appreciation of evidence what matters is the quality of evidence and not the number of witnesses but sometimes in appropriate cases $$$ may adopt a test like the adopted by the allahabad high $$$ in that case. though in that case basis of conviction of the appellants before this $$$ was credible evidence of or more eye -witnesses but still the $$$ observed that ordinarily in cases where there were large number of offenders and large number of victims it would be safe to convict only if the case is supported by or or more witnesses who give consistent account of the incident. this $$$ has observed such a rule of caution ordinarily which would obviously mean that there is no blanket ban or rule of universal application that if the number of eye -witnesses is less than in no case conviction can be upheld. that apart as in that case the appellants were convicted on the basis of evidence of or more eye -witnesses as a matter of fact the apex $$$ was not called upon to go into this question but even then it has made such observations. as noted above no rule of universal application was intended to be laid down or has been laid down. the decision is therefore not applicable to the facts of the present case. it is matter of common experience that in recent times there has been sharp decline of ethical values in public life even in developed countries much less developing like ours where the ratio of decline is higher. even in ordinary cases witnesses are not inclined to depose or their evidence is not found to be credible by courts for manifold reasons. of the reasons may be that they do not have courage to depose against an accused because of threats to their life more so when the offenders are habitual criminals or high -ups in the government or close to powers which may be political economic or other powers including muscle power. a witness may not stand the test of cross -examination which may be sometime because he is a bucolic person and is not able to understand the question put to him by the skilful cross -examiner and at times under the stress of cross -examination certain answers are snatched from him. when a rustic or illiterate witness faces an astute lawyer there is bound to be imbalance and therefore minor discrepancies have to be ignored. $$$$ it is not difficult to gain over a witness by my power or giving him any other allurence or giving out threats to his life and/or property at the instance of persons in / or close to powers and muscle men or their associates. such instances are also not uncommon where a witness is not inclined to depose because in the prevailing social structure he wants to remain indifferent. it is most unfortunate that expert witnesses and the investigating agencies and other agencies which have an important role to play are also not immune form decline of values in public life. their evidence sometimes becomes doubtful because they do not act sincerely take everything in a casual manner and are not able to devote proper attention and time. thus in criminal trial a prosecutor is faced with so many odds. the court while appreciating the evidence should not lose sight of these realities of life and can not affored to take an unrealistic approach by sitting in ivory tower. i find that in recent times the tendency to acquit an accused easily is galloping fast. it is very easy to pass an order of acquittal on the basis of minor points raised in the case a short judgment so as to achieve the yardstick of disposal. some discrepancy is bound to be there in each and every case which should not weigh with the court so long it does not materially affect the prosecution case. in case discrepancies pointed out are in the realm of pebbled court should tread upon it but if the same are boulders court should not make an attempt to jump over the same. $$$$ when crime is looming large and humanity is suffering and society is so much more. now the maxim let guilty persons be acquitted but not a single innocent be convicted is in practice changing world over and courts have been compelled to accept that society suffers by wrong convictions and it equally suffers by wrong acquittals. i find this court in recent times has conscientiously taken notice of these facts from time to time. in the case inder singh and anr. v. state delhi administration $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ $$$ $$$ j. laid down that proof beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline not a fetish and guilty man can not get away with it because truth suffers some infirmity when projected through human processes.in the case of state of u.p. v. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ it was held that a judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. a judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. is as important as the other. both are public duties which the judge has to perform. in the case of state of west bengal v. orilal jaiswal and anr. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ it was held that justice can not be made sterile on the plea that it is better to let guilty escape than punish an innocent. letting guilty escape is not doing justice according to law. in the case of $$$ and anr. v. state of m.p. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ it was held that the courts have been removing chaff from the grain. it has to disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out the smear of dust as all these things clog the very truth. so long chaff cloud and dust remains the criminals are clothed with this protective layer to receive the benefit of doubt. so it is a solemn duty of the courts not to merely conclude and leave the case the moment suspicions are created. it is rous duty of the court within permissible limit to find out the truth. it means on hand no innocent man should be punished but on the other hand to see no person committing an offence should get scot free. if in spite of such effort suspicion is not dissolved it remains writ at large benefit of doubt has to be credited to the accused. thus in the present case where there was more or less a caste war between haves and have nots gruesome murder of persons of community in which several persons were injured great commotion in the locality people became panicky as the accused persons were members of mcc which is a very violent organisation even if the complicity of the accused is proved by credible evidence of or witnesses it would not be unsafe to convict an accused rather a duty is enjoined upon the court not to acquit an accused on this ground al unless the prosecution case is otherwise found to be untrusrthy. it is well settled that in a criminal trial credible evidence of even a solitary witness can form basis of conviction and that of even witnesses may not form such a basis unless their evidence is found to be trusrthy inasmuch as what matters in the matter of appreciation of evidence of witnesses is not the number of witnesses but the quality of their evidence. thus i do not find any substance in the submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants on this count. $$$ counsel next contended that participation of the appellants in the crime becomes highly doubtful as their names have not been enumerated in the confessional statement of accused -bihari manjhi wherein he is said to have named several accused persons. in our view there may be various reasons for non -disclosure of names of these appellants in the confessional statement of co -accused they might not be fully known to the confessing accused or for reasons best known to him with an oblique motive to save the appellants their names might not have been disclosed. it has been further submitted that the informant -satendra kumar sharma has not been examined as such first information report can not be used as substantive piece of evidence inasmuch as on this ground as well the appellants are entitled to an order of acquittal. the submission is totally misconceived. even if the information report is not proved it would not be a ground for acquittal but the case would depend upon the evidence led by prosecution. therefore non -examination of the informant can not in any manner affect the prosecution case. it has been also contended that $$$ who was of the investigating officers has not been examined. the alleged occurrence had taken place on.and in the same night on the basis of fard beyan of the informant recorded by pw.as stated above inspector of police -ram janam singh drew the formal first information report. from the evidence of this witness it would appear that the superintendent of police $$$ directed inspector -ram japit kumar to investigate this case and so long he did not take charge of the investigation this witness was entrusted to commence the investigation under verbal orders of the superintendent of police $$$. pw thereafter inspected the place of occurrence and seized blood stained earth empties and reminiscence of bomb explosion. this witness further stated that as till $$$$ $$$ did not make himself available for taking over investigation of the case he requested superintendent of police to give necessary direction whereupon the investigation was entrusted to suresh chandra sharma pw.who at that time was posted as inspector chandauti police station and pw.made over charge of the case to pw.on.who after completing investigation which was supervised by the superintendent of police himself submitted chargesheet. from the above facts it would be plain that as $$$ had neither taken over charge of the investigation of the case at any point of time much less investigated the same no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution on account of his non -examination and non -furnishing of explanation for his not taking over charge of investigation. thus he having not conducted any investigation the evidence of $$$ could not be of any avail either to the prosecution of the defence. that apart it is well settled that non -examination of nay witness would not affect the prosecution case but in a given case non -examination of a material witness may affect the same. reference in this connection may be made to the decision of this court in the case of masalti supra. it is well settled that non -examination of investigating officer is not fatal for the prosecution unless it is shown that the accused has been prejudiced thereby. in the case on hand in any view of the matter it could not be pointed out that the defence has been prejudiced in any manner by non -examination of inspector -ram japit kumar. it has been then submitted on behalf of the appellants that nothing incriminating could be recovered from them which goes to show that they had no complicity with the crime. in my view recovery of non incriminating material from the accused can not al be taken as a ground to exrate them from the charges more so when their participation in the crime is unfolded in ocular account of the occurrence given by the witnesses whose evidence has been found by me to be unimpeachable. it was pointed out that as the alleged occurrence is said to have taken place during it was not possible to identify the accused persons much less nay of the appellants. firstly i find that the witnesses have stated that there was no electricity in the village during that night and consistently they have deposed and supported each other on the point that accused persons had set fire in houses and heaps of straw in the light of which they had identified the accused persons including the appellants. in view of the fact that the night was not dark and there was sufficient light by virtue of setting fire in the houses and heaps of straw it can not be said that it was not possible for the witnesses to identify the accused persons much less any of the appellants. $$$ counsel further pointed out that according to the prosecution case and evidence n of the appellants are alleged to have assaulted either any of the deceased or the injured persons and that from mere presence at the place of occurrence their participation in the crime can not be inferred inasmuch as they may be even sight seers. in my view there is absolutely no foundation for the submissions that the accused persons may be sight seers as no suggestion was given to any of the witnesses on this score. according to the prosecution case and the evidence the accused persons arrived at the village of occurrence pursuant to a conspiracy hatched up by them they divided themselves into several groups different groups went to the houses of different persons in the village entered the houses by breaking open the door forcibly took away inmates of the house after tying their hands taken them first to the temple and thereafter near the canal where their legs were also tied and there some of them were d to death at the point of firearm but a vast majority of them were massacred by slitting their throats with pasuli. thing is clear that all these acts were d by the accused persons pursuant to a conspiracy hatched up by them to completely eliminate members of a particular community in the village and to achieve that object they formed unlawful assembly and different members of that unlawful assembly had played different role. in view of these facts merely because the appellants are not said to have assaulted either any of the deceased or injured persons it can not be inferred that they had no complicity with the crime core so according to the evidence they were also armed with deadly weapons like firearms bombs etc.but did not use the same. reference in this connection may be made to a decision of this court in the case of masalti supra where it was laid down that where a crowd of assailants who were members of an unlawful assembly proceeds to commit the crime in pursuance of the common object of that assemble it is often not possible for witnesses to describe actual part played by each of them and a large crowd of persons armed with weapons assaults the intended victims it may not be necessary that ll of them have to take part in the actual assault as in that case several weapons were carried by different members of unlawful assembly and an accused who was member of such an unlawful assembly and was carrying firearm can not take any advantage from the fact that he did not use the firearms though other members of the unlawful assembly used their respective arms. $$$ counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in the alternative submitted that the present case can not be said to be rarest of the rare so as to justify imposition of extreme penalty of death. this question has been examined by this court times without number. in the case of masalti supra a bench of this court had examined the question as to whether a member of unlawful assembly the object of which was to commit murder of certain persons and some of the members of which had assaulted and d members of a family to death and others though armed with weapon did not use the same can be absolved form extreme penalty of death. it was contended that such a member of the unlawful assembly who was not the assailant could not be awarded the extreme penalty of death. repelling the contention gajendragadkar c.j.observed at pages -thus:-...as mere proposition of law it would be difficult to accept the argument that the sentence of death can be legitimately imposed only where an accused person in found to have committed the murder himself. whether or not sentences of death should be imposed on persons who are found to be guilty not because they themselves committed the murder but because they were members of an unlawful assembly and the offence of murder was committed by or more of the members of such an assembly in pursuance of the common object of that assembly is a matter which has to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each case. in the present case it is clear that whole group of persons belonged to laxmi prasad 's faction joined together armed with deadly weapons and they were inspired by the common object of exterminating the male member in the family of gayadin. of these persons were armed with fire -arms and the other with several other deadly weapons and evidence shows that murders by shooting were committed by the members of this unlawful assembly. the conduct of the members of the unlawful assembly both before and after the commission of the offence has been considered by the courts below and it has been held that in order to suppress such fantastic criminal conduct on the part of villagers it is necessary to impose the sentences of death on members of the unlawful assembly who were armed with firearms. it can not be said that discretion in the matter has been improperly exercised either by the trial court or by the high court. therefore we see no reason to accept the argument urged by mr. sawhney that he test adopted by the high court in dealing with the question of sentence is mechanical and unreasonable.emphasis added]86. in the case of $$$ v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/0/0$$$ / sc/0/0 before a constitution bench of this court validity of the provision for death penalty was challenged on the ground that the same was violative of articles and of the constitution and while repelling the contention the court laid down the scope of exercise of power to award death sentence and the meaning of the expression rarest of the rare so as to justify extreme penalty of death and considered that article clauses and of the international covenant on civil and political rights to which india has acceded in do not abolish or prohibit the imposition of death penalty in all circumstances. all that they required is that firstly death penalty shall not be arbitrarily inflicted secondly it shall be imposed only for most serious crimes in accordance with a law which shall not be an post facto legislation. the penal code prescribes death penalty as an alternative punishment only for heinous crimes which are not more than in number. section of the criminal procedure code in keeping with the spirit of the international covenant has further restricted the area of death penalty. now according to this changed legislative policy which is patent on the face of section the normal punishment for murder and other capital offence under the penal code is imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years and death penalty is an exception. the present legislative policy discernible from section read with section is that in fixing the degree of punishment or making the choice of sentence for various offence including under section penal code the court should not confine its consideration principally or merely to the circumstances connected with the particular crime but also given due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal. in many cases the extremely cruel or beastly manner of the commission of murder is itself a demonstrated index of the depraved character of the perpetrator. and it is only when the culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that special reasons can legitimately be said to exist. judges should never be blood thirsty. it is therefore imperative to voice the concern that courts aided by the broad illustrative guidelines indicated will discharge the rous function with evermore scrupulous care and humane concern directed along the highroad of legislative policy outlined in section viz.that for persons convicted of murder life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. in the case of $$$ v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ a bench of this court following the decision in $$$ supra observed that in rarest of rare cases when collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power center to inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty. the community may entertain such a sentiment in the following circumstances i. when the murder is committed in an extremely brutal grotesque diabolical revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community. for instance when the house of the victim is set aflame with end in view to roast him alive in the house when the victim is subjected to inhuman acts of torture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her death and when the body of the victim is cut into pieces or his body is dismembered in a fiendish manner.ii. when the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness. for instance when a hired assassin commits murder for the sake of my or reward or a cold -blooded murder is committed with a deliberate design in order to inherit property or to gain control over property of a ward or a person under the control of the murderer or vis -a -vis whom the murdered is in a dominating position or in a position of trust or a murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland. when murder of a member of a scheduled caste or minority community etc.is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances etc.which arouse social wrath. for instance when such a crime is committed in order to terrorise such persons and frighten them into fleeing from a place or in order to deprive them of or make them surrender lands or benefits conferred on them with a view to reverse past injustices and in order to restore the social balance. in cases of bride burning and what are known as dowry deaths or when murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation.iv. when the crime is enormous in proportion. for instance when multiple murders say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste community or locality are committed.v. when the victim of murder is an innocent child who could not have or has not provided even an excuse much less a provocation for murder a helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or infirmity c when the victim is a person vis -a -vis whom the murderer is in a position of domination or trust d when the victim is a public figure generally loved and respected by the community for the services rendered by him and the murder is committed for political or similar reasons other than personal reasons. in the said case the court further observed that in this background the guidelines indicated in the case of $$$ supra will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each individual case and where the question of imposing death sentence arises the following proposition emerge from the case of $$$ supra):-(i the extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability.before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime.life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. in other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life can not be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.a balance -sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weight age and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised. the court thereafter observed act in order to apply these guidelines the following questions may be answered:-(a is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?(b are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender?90. ultimately in the said case of $$$ supra the court observed that if upon an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the answers to the questions posed hereinabove the circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted the court would proceed to do so. in the light of the law already laid down by this court referred to above now this court is called upon to consider whether the present case would come within the realm of the rarest of the rare or not. from the evidence adduced it has been amply proved that the accused persons belonged to a militant group being members of m.c.c. which is consider to be an organisation of militants hatched up a conspiracy to massacre members of particular community in the village in question and were raising slogans ' long live mcc and whoever comes in their way would be destroyed. pursuant to the conspiracy hatched up the militants formed different groups and went to different localities in the village in police uniforms armed with fire arms and explosive substances broke open the doors of houses of members of that particular community took out the entire family members after tying their hands had taken some of them to the temple and thereafter to the canal whereas others we directly taken to the canal after tying their hands where their legs were also tied and after surrounding them form all sides when they were in most helpless condition and could not taken recourse to save their lives some of them were d to death by fire arms but vast majority were massacred by skittering their throats with pasuli which resulted into casualties and several persons were injured including prosecution witnesses. the number of accused persons was vast but upon completion of investigation charge sheet was submitted against persons and so many persons were shown as prosecution witnesses therein. the accused persons also set fire to the houses of the members of the said community in the village. as a result of this incident there was great commotion in the locality. there can not be any manner of doubt that the villagers were d to death in an extremely diabolic revolting and dastardly manner and had affected the normal tempo of life of the community in the locality. the crime in the present case is not only ghastly but also enormous in proportion as persons all of whom belonged to community were massacred. thus after taking into consideration the balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in which persons have been deprived of their lives by the accused persons who were thirsty of their blood i have no doubt in holding that culpability of the accused persons assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that a special reason can legitimately be said to exist within the meaning of section of the code of criminal procedure in the case on hand and it would be mockery of justice if extreme penalty of death is not imposed. thus i am clearly of the opinion that the designated court was quite justified in upholding convictions of the appellants and awarding the extreme penalty of death which punishment al was called for in the facts of the present case. in the circumstances of the case the appeal fails and the same is dismissed but the reference is accepted and death penalty awarded against the appellants is confirmed.arijit pasayat j. while i respectfully agree with brother b.n. agrawal that the appeal deserves dismissal few aspects are indicated by me to supplement his conclusions and views. accused -appellants have placed strong reliance on the decision of this court in masalti and ors. v. state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/007/$$$ / sc/007/ to contend that since large number of accused persons were involved evidence of or witnesses would not suffice. to bring home accusation against appellant no. a-9 $$$ @ dharo singh prosecution placed reliance on the evidence of $$$ pw $$$ pw9 and $$$ pw. evidence of pws and has not been considered credible. so pw also pointed out accusing fingers at appellant no. -nanhe lal mochi accused no. and appellant no. -bir kuer paswan accused no. so far as accused -appellant no. $$$ @ dharo singh is concerned pw 's evidence is the only material against him while in case of the other accused -appellants other witnesses have also corroborated the version of this witness. masalti 's case supra can not be said to have laid down any rule of universal application as contended by learned counsel for accused -appellants that conviction can not be made on the basis of a single witness 's evidence as large number of accused persons are on trial. it is a well settled principle in law that evidence is to be considered on the basis of its quality and the quantity. section of indian evidence act is a pointer in that regard. this provision follows the maxim that evidence is to be weighed and not counted. in masalti 's case supra the desirability to have at least witnesses has been stated to be a matter of prudence. such a requirement can never be said to be inviolable as would be culled out from $$$ v. state of assam $$$ / sc/0228/3$$$ / sc/0228/3 maqsoodan v. state of u.p. $$$ / sc/0083/2$$$ / sc/0083/2. appreciation of evidence can not conceive of any rule of universal application and is certainly not to be treated as a theorem and there can be no empirical formula. the evidence on the facts of each case has to be analysed and conclusions drawn and there can not be pigeon -holing of evidence on any set formula. it has not been shown by accused -appellants as to how evidence of pw suffers from any infirmity. since in masalti 's case supra a rule of caution was laid and not a mandatory rule of universal application it is certainly not to be treated as a rule of law. there is always peril in treating the words of a judgment as though they are words in a legislative enactment and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case. circumstantial flexibility additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in cases. see $$$ dead and ors. v. state of $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/082/2002$$$ / sc/082/2002. it is more so in a case where conclusions relate to appreciation of evidence in a criminal trial. stress was laid by the accused -appellants on the non -acceptance of evidence tendered by some witnesses to contend about desirability to throw out entire prosecution case. in essence prayer is to apply the principle of falsus in uno in omnibus. this plea is clearly untenable. even if major portion of evidence is found to be deficient in case residue is sufficient to prove guilt of an accused notwithstanding acquittal of number of other co -accused persons his conviction can be maintained. it is the duty of court to separate grain from chaff. where chaff can be separated from grain it would be open to the court to convict an accused notwithstanding the fact that evidence has been found to be deficient to prove guilt of other accused persons. falsity of particular materials witness or material particular would not ruin it from the beginning to end. the maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus has no application in india and the witnesses can not be branded as liar. the maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus false in thing false in everything has not received general acceptance nor has this maxim come to occupy the status of rule of law. it is merely a rule of caution. all that it amounts to is that in such cases testimony may be disregarded and not that it must be disregarded. the doctrine merely involves the question of weight of evidence which a court may apply in a given set of circumstances but it is not what may be called a mandatory rule of evidence. see nisar alli v. the state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/0032/957$$$ / sc/0032/957. merely because some of the accused persons have been acquitted though evidence against all of them so far as direct testimony went was the same does not lead as a necessary corollary that whose who have been convicted must also be acquitted. it is always open to a court to differentiate accused who had been acquitted from those who were convicted. see gurucharan singh and anr. v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/022/955$$$ / sc/022/955. the doctrine is a dangerous specially in india for if a whole body of the testimony were to be rejected because witness was evidently speaking an untruth in some aspect it is to be feared that administration of criminal justice would come to a dead -stop. witnesses just can not help in giving embroidery to a story however true in the main. therefore it has to be appraised in each case as to what extent the evidence is worthy of acceptance and merely because in some respects the court considers the same to be insufficient for placing reliance on the testimony of a witness it does not necessarily follow as a matter of law that it must be disregarded in all respects as well. the evidence has to be shifted with care. the aforesaid dictum is not a sound rule for the reason that one hardly comes across a witness whose evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or at any rate exaggeration embroideries or embellishment. see sohrab s / o $$$ and anr. v. the state of madhya pradesh $$$ / sc/025/2$$$ / sc/025/2 and $$$ and ors. v. the state of bihar $$$ / sc/0333/96$$$ / sc/0333/96 air965sc277. an attempt has to be made to as noted above in terms of felicitous metapher separate grain from the chaff truth from falsehood. where it is not feasible to separate truth from falsehood because grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up and in the process of separation an absolutely new case has to be reconstructed by divorcing essential details presented by the prosecution completely from the context and the background against which they are made the only available course to be made is to discard the evidence in toto. see $$$ v. state of madhya pradesh $$$ / sc/0093/952$$$ / sc/0093/952 air95sc5 and $$$ and ors. v. the state of punjab. $$$ / sc/0087/5$$$ / sc/0087/5. as observed by this court in state of rajasthan v. smt. kalki and anr. $$$ / sc/025/$$$ / sc/025/ normal discrepancies in evidence are those which are due to normal errors of observation normal errors of memory due to lapse of time due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence and those are always there however honest and truthful a witness may be. material discrepancies are those which are not normal and not expected of a normal person. courts have to label the category to which a discrepancy may be categorized. while normal discrepancies do not corrode the credibility of a party 's case material discrepancies do so. accusations have been established against accused -appellants in the case at hand. the factual scenario highlighted and established by the prosecution shows how gruesome and macabre acts were perpetrated by the accused persons. people lost their lives and several others have been seriously injured because of caste war. the gruesome acts were diabolic in their conception and cruel in execution. there was deliberate and planned destruction of extensive properties and annihilation of large number of persons. all these happened as noted above on account of caste war. in a country like ours where discrimination on the ground of caste or religion is a taboo taking lives of persons belonging to another caste or religion is bound to have dangerous and reactive effect on the society at large. it strikes at the very root of the orderly society which the founding fathers of our constitution dreamt of. it has been conclusively held that accused persons were not innocent by -standers or onlookers. chain of evidence clearly shows that their object was. the guidelines which emerge from bachan singh 's case supra have to be applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposition of death sentence arises. in case at hand in the minimum guidelines and which are as follows are clearly applicable:-( when the murder is committed in an extremely brutal grotesque diabolical revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community.$$$ when the crime is enormous in proportion. for instance when multiple murders say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste community or locality are committed. the criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality in prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct. it ordinarily allows some significant discretion to the judge in arriving at a sentence in each case presumably to permit sentences that reflect more subtle considerations of culpability that are raised by the special facts of each case. punishment ought always to fit with the crime. in $$$ v. state of assam manu / sc/0466/2000manu / sc/0466/2000 this court observed that though it is time that in a civilized society a tooth for tooth and a nail for nail or death for death is not the rule but it is equally true that when a man becomes a boast and menace to the society he can be deprived of his life according to the procedure established by law as constitution itself has recognized the death sentence as a permissible punishment for which sufficient constitutional provisions for an appeal reprieve and the like have been provided under the law. above being the position the accused -appellants deserve death sentence which has been awarded by the trial court. in conclusion the conviction and the sentence as awarded by the trial court are to be upheld and appeal deserves to be dismissed.
