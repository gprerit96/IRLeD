. we have heard learned counsel for the respective parties. although basic question of law is common in both the appeals there are some variations in the facts and wherever relevant the said differences will be pointed out. for the sake of convenience we are taking the facts from c.a. no. of. the $$$ -arbind kumar was appointed as a $$$ in $$$ on 1st march. there is no dispute that the provisions in the police manual for such appointment were not followed and without inviting applications from the eligible persons $$$ 's case for appointment was allegedly recommended by the superintendent of police $$$ to the director general cum inspector general of police welfare $$$ dg cum ig on the ground that father of the $$$ was an assistant sub inspector of police and had met with an accident on nd august and sustained injuries leading to amputation of right leg. it is not in dispute that father of the $$$ continued to serve the police force till he superannuated sometime in. so far as the appellants in the other appeal i. c.a. no. of are concerned they claim to be brave persons who helped the police against the naxalites and as a result both of them were recommended for appointment by the then superintendent of police $$$ to the dg cum ig bihar patna and after their cases were cleared by the dg cum ig they were appointed as constables on october. the appellants underwent training and began working as constables. when the fact of such appointments made without adhering to the provisions in the police manual came to light the home secretary government of bihar issued a communication in september to issue notice to persons appointed in such manner against law and to cancel such appointments if they were so found. as a result of such exercise the service of the appellants came to be terminated in and. the termination was after serving show cause notice on the simple ground that the appointments were made through a process unknown to law and in total disregard of the relevant provisions in the police manual. some controversy was raised as to whether show cause notice was served on the appellant -arbind kumar but it has been pointed out that his show cause as well as the notice is annexed as annexure p-6. on behalf of the arbind kumar reliance has been placed on a judgment of this court in the case of $$$ and ors. v. state of bihar and ors. $$$ / sc/161/$$$$$$$ / sc/161/$$$$ scc whereby this court in the peculiar facts of that case directed for framing a scheme for absorption / regularisation of the appointees who were working as temporary or ad -hoc for a long number of $$$$. the judgment itself makes it clear that the order was passed under article of the constitution of india with a specific observation that it shall not be treated as a precedent. hence we are not persuaded to follow that course of action in the present case. although the appellants have pleaded that they are mere victims of irregular or illegal action by the concerned police officials who appointed them to the post of constable without following the procedure prescribed under the police manual and hence deserve sympathy but we are not persuaded to accept such submission. in our considered view the beneficiaries can not blame the appointing authority al and claim that the illegal appointment should be continued in perpetuity. to accept such plea would amount to giving premium to dishst and illegal acts in matters of public appointments. the appellants were terminated as soon as authorities came to know of such illegal appointments. they had not completed even years so as to perhaps raise a claim for time consideration for regularisation in terms of judgment of the constitution bench in secretary state of karnataka and ors. v. uma devi and ors. manu / sc/1918/$$$$manu / sc/1918/$$$$ scc. in the facts of the case we find no merit in these appeals they are accordingly dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs.
