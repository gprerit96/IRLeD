m. $$$ j. leave granted. this appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated.of the gauhati high court whereby the revision petition filed by the respondents was allowed and the eviction suit filed by the $$$ was dismissed. the litigation between the parties commenced when the $$$ filed an eviction suit against $$$ the father of the respondents. the case of the $$$ was that he had became the owner of the suit property by virtue of exchange deeds executed on.with his brother pw ranjeet prasad the original owner. in before the execution of the said exchange deed pw ranjeet prasad was said to have let of the rooms in the building in the suit property to $$$ the father of $$$ and the grandfather of the respondents. however even after the execution of the exchange deed pw ranjeet prasad was stated to have continued collecting rent from the tenants of the suit property including $$$ and on $$$ 's death his son $$$ till $$$$ with the consent of the $$$. in the $$$ was stated to have taken over the affairs of the suit property mutated his name as the owner and requested $$$ to execute a fresh agreement with him. the $$$ contended that $$$ had not only failed to execute a fresh agreement but also failed to pay the rent except for the electricity bills. the $$$ also cited bonafide need of the suit property for the purpose of opening a medical clinic being a retired surgeon. the $$$ hence prayed for the eviction of $$$. defendant $$$ filed written statement denying all the allegations and alleged that pw ranjeet prasad had executed tenancy agreement dated.in favour of $$$ and later on executed tenancy agreement dated.in his favour. he denied being informed of the exchange deed dated.and contended that ranjeet prasad was his landlord and not the $$$. the defendant $$$ alleged that since they refused to accept the rent from him from $$$$ onwards the defendant deposited the rent in court. the defendant prayed for the dismissal of the suit. the trial court noted that pw ranjeet prasad had represented himself to be the landlord in the agreement dated.and in the rent receipts and also filed a suit for eviction against of the tenants in the suit property in the capacity of a landlord. pw was noted to have never stated being the representative of the $$$ or there being a property exchange. even if it was assumed that he had received the electricity charges the $$$ was held to have failed to prove himself as the landlord as the $$$ had not produced any evidence of having received rent from any of tenants. the mutation entry in his name was held to be not proof of title in the suit property. considering the deposition of $$$ as dw wherein he stated that the $$$ had refused to accept the rent from him the trial court held that the $$$ had waived his right to be called a landlord. the trial court held that pw ranjeet prasad was the landlord of the suit property under section of the assam urban areas rent control act in short rent act. the trial court dismissed the suit rejecting plaintiff- $$$ 's contention that $$$ had defaulted in the payment of rent and that he needed the suit property for bonafide use on the grounds that the $$$ was not the landlord of the suit property and $$$ had been admittedly depositing the rent in the court. aggrieved by the decision of the trial court the $$$ preferred an appeal before the district court. the appellate court noted that the ownership of the suit property has been proved in the light of the exchange deed which remained unchallenged by the defendant and supported by pw ranjeet prasad. the appellate court further noted that the plaintiff served notice requesting $$$ to attorn the $$$ as the landlord and pay the rent to him. the appellate court therefore held that the $$$ is the landlord of the suit property considering the deposition of $$$ that the $$$ had refused to accept the rent from him the deposition of pw ranjeet prasad that he had directed all the tenants to pay the rent to the $$$ from $$$$ onwards and the admission of the respondent no. dw son of $$$ that he was paying the electricity charges to the $$$. $$$ was held to have defaulted in the payment of rent from $$$$ onwards as he was depositing rent in the court in the name of pw ranjeet prasad and not the $$$ despite knowing that the $$$ was the landlord. the $$$ also proved the need for bonafide use as he and his wife were medical practitioners wanting to open a clinic in the rented premises and as the defendant $$$ owns another premises and would not hence be facing difficulty. allowing the appeal the appellate court directed the defendant $$$ to vacate the suit property. $$$ therefore preferred a revision petition before the high court. the high court observed that the appellate court has not considered the tenancy agreements dated.and.which were also not mentioned in the depositions of the $$$ pw and ranjeet prasad pw and the plaint. the high court upheld the trial court findings regarding the various instances when pw represented himself as the landlord. observing that there was no conveyance of title after the execution of the agreement dated.the high court opined that the $$$ could not be held to be the owner or landlord of the suit property on the basis of the exchange deed dated.. the high court observed that the definitions of the terms ' tenant and landlord were not related to ownership of the suit property. pw ranjeet prasad was held to be the landlord of defendant $$$ considering the agreements dated.and.and that ranjeet prasad had filed eviction suits as a landlord. once landlord -tenant relationship existed between the pw ranjeet prasad and the defendant $$$ the same should have been determined only as per the provisions of the rent control act. holding that there was no need to give a finding regarding default in the payment of rent or bonafide requirement when there was no landlord -tenant relationship between the $$$ and the defendant $$$ the high court allowed the revision petition filed by the respondents -tenants and dismissed the suit for eviction filed by the $$$. hence the present appeal by special leave by the plaintiff. while reversing the appellate court judgment the high court in paragraph nos. and of the impugned order held as under:. this revision petition arises out of a claim of relief under section of the assam urban areas rent control act. unlike general law governing tenancy this act confers a statutory status on tenant and on attainment of such status a tenant earns protection guaranteed under section of this act. no tenant under this act can be evicted without a decree of court. the landlord therefore is duty bound to obtain a decree from court by establishing the conditions precedent laid down under section referred to above. the foundation of such a suit is relationship of landlord and tenant. the fact that there exists a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties is the starting point for conferring jurisdiction on a court to entertain and decide the dispute. such fact constituting landlord tenant relationship therefore is a jurisdictional fact and not a mere fact and as such high court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under section of the code of civil procedure is duty bound to examine as to whether such a finding arrived at by the learned court or courts below is tenable and/or based on materials on record. these aspects are no doubt relevant for the purpose of adjudicating a jurisdictional fact as to landlord tenant relationship in a proceeding under section of the assam urban areas rent control act. apparently these relevant aspects were not considered by the learned appellate court. the finding of the learned appellate court therefore on issue no. is vitiated by non -consideration of relevant aspect and non -consideration of exhibits ka $$$ and gha. the finding of the appellate court that there is a landlord and tenant relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant is liable to be held as perverse inasmuch as plaintiff has failed to meet the challenges thrown by the defendant by bringing on record exhibits ka $$$ and gha and claiming that plaintiff never derived the title from ranjeet prasad subsequent to creation of tenancy in. the decision of appellate court on issue no. therefore is liable to be interfered with. once it is held that there is no landlord and tenant relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant there is no question of giving any decision on the issue of default or bona -fide requirement. consequently findings of the appellate court on these issues are also set aside. in the result civil revision petition is allowed and the impugned appellate judgment is set aside restoring the judgment of the learned trial court. we have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties. before coming to the conclusion we would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the assam urban area rent control act. the expression landlord has been defined in section of the rent act which reads as under:(c landlord means any person who is for the time being receiving or entitled to receive rent in respect of any house whether on his own account or on account or on behalf or for the benefit of any other person or as a trustee guardian or receiver for any other person and includes in respect of his subtenant a tenant who has sub -let any house and includes every person not being a tenant who from time to time derives title under a landlord. section of the act creates a bar against the passing or execution of a decree or order for ejection. section reads as under:5. no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any house shall be made or executed by any court so long as the tenant pays rent to the full extent allowable under this act and performs the conditions of the tenancy provided that nothing in this $$$ -section shall apply in a suit or proceedings for eviction of the tenant from the house:-(a where the tenant has done anything contrary to the provisions of clause m clause o or clause p of section of the transfer of property act or to the spirit of the aforesaid clause in areas where the said act does not apply or(b where the tenant has been guilty of conduct which is a nuisance of an annoyance to the occupiers of the adjoining or neighbouring houses or(c where the house is bonafide required by the landlord either for purposes of repairs or rebuilding or for his own occupation or for the occupation of any person for whose benefit the house is held or whether the landlord can show any other cause which may be deemed satisfactory by the court or(d where the tenant sublets the house or any part thereof or otherwise transfers his interest in the house or any part thereof without permission in writing from the landlord where the tenant has not paid the rent lawfully due from him in respect of the house within a fortnight of its falling due or(f where the tenant has built acquired or been allotted a suitable residence. from the definition of landlord it is clear that the definition is couched in a very wide language according to which not only the owner but also any person receiving rent whether on his own account or on behalf of or for the benefit of any other person or as a trustee guardian or receiver for any other person is also the landlord. however for the purpose of eviction of a tenant on the ground of personal need or reasonable requirement one must show that he is the owner of the building. a similar question came for consideration before a judges bench of this court in the case of m.m. quasim v. manohar lal sharma and ors. $$$ / sc/0223/980$$$ / sc/0223/980 air sc. the matter related to the bihar building lease rent and eviction control act. in the bihar rent act the definition of expression landlord is similar as that of assam rent act. further the ground for eviction of personal necessity is also similar to that of the assam act. considering these provisions this court held:4..therefore while taking advantage of the enabling provision enacted in section the person claiming possession on the ground of his reasonable requirement of the leased building must show that he is a landlord in the sense that he is owner of the building and has a right to occupy the same in his own right. a mere rent collector though may be included in the expression landlord in its wide amplitude can not be treated as a landlord for the purposes of section. this becomes manifestly clear from the explanation appended to the clause. by restricting the meaning of expression landlord for the purpose of section the legislature manifested its intention namely that landlord alone can seek eviction on the ground of his personal requirement if he is who has a right against the whole world to occupy the building himself and exclude any one holding a title lesser than his own. such landlord who is an owner and who would have a right to occupy the building in his own right can seek possession for his own use. the latter part of the section envisages a situation where the landlord is holding the building for the benefit of some other person but in that case landlord can seek to evict tenant not for his personal use but for the personal requirement of that person for whose benefit he holds the building. the clause contemplates a situation of trustees and cesti que trust but when the case is governed by the part of clause c of sub -section of section the person claiming possession for personal requirement must be such a landlord who wants possession for his own occupation and this would imply that he must be a person who has a right to remain in occupation against the whole world and not someone who has no subsisting interest in the property and is merely a rent collector such as an agent executor administrator or a receiver of the property. for the purposes of section the expression landlord could therefore mean a person who is the owner of the building and who has a right to remain in occupation and actual possession of the building to the exclusion of everyone else. it is such a person who can seek to evict the tenant on the ground that he requires possession in good faith for his own occupation. a rent collector or an agent is not entitled to occupy the house in his own right. even if such a person be a lessor and therefore a landlord within the expanded inclusive definition of the expression landlord nonetheless he can not seek to evict the tenant on the ground that he wants to personally occupy the house. he can not claim such a right against the real owner and as a necessary corollary he can not seek to evict the tenant on the ground that he wants possession of the premises for his own occupation. that can be the only reasonable interpretation one can put on the ingredients of clause c of section which reads where the building is reasonably and in good faith required by the landlord for his own occupation..assuming that the expression landlord has to be understood with the same connotation as is spelt out by the definition clause even a rent collector or a receiver of the property appointed by the court in bankruptcy proceedings would be able to evict the tenant alleging that he wants the building for his own occupation a right which he could not have claimed against the real owner. therefore the explanation to clause c which cuts down the wide amplitude of the expression landlord would unmistakably show that for the purposes of clause c such landlord who in the sense in which the word owner is understood can claim as of right to the exclusion of everyone to occupy the house would be entitled to evict the tenant for his own occupation. the high court appears to have taken a very narrow meaning and interpretation of the expression landlord as defined in the assam rent act. the finding recorded on that score to the effect that there exists no relationship of landlord and tenant is not in accordance with the true meaning of the term landlord. this aspect of the law has not been considered by the high court. on the contrary the high court proceeded on the basis that the relationship of landlord and tenant has not been established although the ownership of the $$$ by virtue of the deed of exchange has neither been denied nor been disputed by the respondent -tenant. even assuming for the sake of argument that the elder brother of the $$$ was acting as a landlord by receiving rent it will not debar the original owner from filing a suit for eviction not only on the ground of personal necessity but also on the ground of default when it has come in evidence that the respondent on many occasions went to the $$$ to pay rent but the latter refused to receive the rent. moreover admittedly the respondent -tenant was paying electricity and other charges of the tenanted premises to the $$$. on the question of tenancy both the trial court and the high court have not considered the provision of section of the transfer of property act. rights of lessor 's transferee.the lessor transfers the property leased or any part thereof or any part of his interest therein the transferee in the absence of a contract to the contrary shall possess all the rights and if the lessee so elects be subject to all the liabilities of the lessor as to the property or part transferred so long as he is the owner of it but the lessor shall not by reason only of such transfer cease to be subject to any of the liabilities imposed upon him by the lease unless the lessee elects to treat the transferee as the person liable to him provided that the transferee is not entitled to arrears of rent due before the transfer and that if the lessee not having reason to believe that such transfer has been made pays rent to the lessor the lessee shall not be liable to pay such rent over again to the transferee.the lessor the transferee and the lessee may determine what proportion of the premium or rent reserved by the lease is payable in respect of the part so transferred and in case they disagree such determination may be made by any court having jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the possession of the property leased. from perusal of the aforesaid section it is manifest that after the transfer of lessor 's right in favour of the transferee the latter gets all rights and liabilities of the lessor in respect of subsisting tenancy. the section does not insist that transfer will take effect only when the tenant attorns. it is well settled that a transferee of the landlord 's rights steps into the shoes of the landlord with all the rights and liabilities of the transferor landlord in respect of the subsisting tenancy. the section does not require that the transfer of the right of the landlord can take effect only if the tenant attorns to him. attornment by the tenant is not necessary to confer validity of the transfer of the landlord 's rights. since attornment by the tenant is not required a notice under section in terms of the old terms of lease by the transferor landlord would be proper and so also the suit for ejectment. as noticed above the respondent -tenant on many occasions approached the $$$ the transferee owner and the landlord to receive the rent. further admittedly the electricity charges of the tenanted premises were paid by the tenant to the present $$$. non -consideration of subsequent tenancy agreement executed by the erstwhile owner namely the brother of the $$$ will not come in the way of the present $$$ to seek eviction of the tenant on the ground of personal necessity as also on the ground of non -payment of rent. the approach of the high court reversing the appellate court 's finding can not be sustained in law. for the aforesaid reasons this appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court is set aside. however there shall be no order as to costs.
