sale in form- by following the procedure prescribed under the rdb act. the auction of the properties of deve sugars ltd.in the instance was fixed for.. at the instant juncture the workers ' union tungabadra sugar works mazdoor sangh of deve sugars ltd.approached the high court of karnataka by filing $$$ no. of. through the above writ petition the workers ' union assailed the recovery proceedings initiated by the state bank of mysore before the recovery officer. the workers ' union also sought an interim direction from the high court of karnataka to restrain the continuation of the sale proceedings at the hands of the recovery officer because their salary and provident fund dues were still payable by deve sugars ltd. the aforesaid prayer was made by asserting that the workers ' union had a preferential claim as against the claim of the state bank of mysore under the provisions of the companies act. a learned single judge of the high court of karnataka while issuing notice directed that the sale made by the recovery officer would be subject to the final outcome of the writ petition. it would also be relevant to reiterate that the official liquidator was authorized by the high court at madras to take over possession of the properties of the company under liquidation. the official liquidator had accordingly taken over possession of the said properties on.. while permitting the state bank of mysore to pursue the recovery proceedings against deve sugars ltd. before the $$$ the high court at madras had directed that the official liquidator be impleaded as a respondent before the $$$. the official liquidator had also raised objections to the purported sale by the recovery officer in continuation of the recovery certificate dated.issued by the $$$. the official liquidator sought deferment of the sale proceedings at the hands of the recovery officer under section of the companies act. it would be relevant to mention that the objections raised by the workers ' union and the official liquidator were overruled by the recovery officer. it is also pertinent to mention that the auction scheduled by the recovery officer for.could not be conducted. accordingly a fresh proclamation was issued for the auction of the properties of deve sugars ltd.fixing.as the date for holding the auction. the rival parties were also permitted to bring their buyers if there was any interested. the reserve price was fixed at rs. crores. the auction was actually conducted on.. the highest bid was made by anita international the $$$ before this court. the bid of anita international of rs.crores was accepted. the bidder deposited the bid amount within the stipulated period. no challenge was raised against the auction conducted on.within the postulated period of days as is permissible in terms of the rules framed under the rdb act. the recovery officer ordered the confirmation of the sale of the auctid property after the expiry of statutory period expressed in rules and of the second schedule of the income tax act as is applicable to proceedings before debts recovery tribunals on.. on.the recovery officer appointed a receiver to take possession of the property sold at the auction. the court commissir allegedly took over possession of some of the properties and handed over the same to the auction purchaser -anita international. at the instant juncture the $$$ -anita international filed company application no. of before the high court at madras for removal of the security agency. at the said juncture videocon international ltd. and $$$. ltd. filed $$$ no. of before the high court of karnataka. the above writ petition and $$$ no. of filed by the workers ' union were heard by a learned single judge wherein the auction purchaser -anita international raised a preliminary objection. it was submitted that the petitirs before the high court had an efficacious alternative remedy under the rdb act. it was accordingly prayed that the petitirs be relegated to their alternative remedy. company application no. of was filed before the company court in the high court at madras wherein a challenge was raised to the sale of the assets of deve sugars ltd.at the hands of the recovery officer. it would be relevant to mention that the above writ petitions were disposed of by the high court of karnataka by a common order dated.. the petitirs before the karnataka high court were allowed to avail of their alternative remedy before the $$$ bangalore. the above common order dated.was challenged by filing $$$. and of. both the above writ appeals were dismissed on.. liberty was however reserved with $$$s by permitting them to approach the $$$ bangalore by filing appeals. as a matter of abundant caution the appellate court ordered that the $$$ bangalore would deal with the controversy uninfluenced by the orders passed by the high court. in compliance with and in continuation of the outcome before the high court of karnataka the workers ' union preferred aor no. of and videocon international ltd. preferred aor no. of. in the above appeals a challenge was raised to the order dated.passed by the recovery officer whereby the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. conducted on.in favour of anita international was confirmed. simultaneously n. ponnusamy an -director of deve sugars ltd.filed company application nos. -of before the company court in the high court at madras and sought the setting aside of the auction sale dated.as well as the confirmation order dated.after the payment of the consideration amount. the challenge raised by. ponnusamy was primarily on the ground that the reserve price of rs. crore was too low. n. ponnusamy also sought transfer of the recovery proceedings from the $$$ bangalore to the high court at madras. while entertaining the proceedings initiated by. ponnusamy the high court by its order dated.passed an parte interim order of stay. anita international and state bank of mysore filed detailed objections to the applications filed by the official liquidator as well as by the aforementid n. ponnusamy. all the applications filed in c.a. no. of were taken up for consideration collectively. by a common order dated.the application filed by the official liquidator was dismissed by holding that the official liquidator was a party before the karnataka high court in the proceedings which were disposed of by a common order dated.and in consonance with the above order the official liquidator was obliged to file an appeal to challenge the auction sale dated.as well as the order of confirmation dated.passed by the recovery officer. likewise the proceedings initiated by. ponnusamy also did not yield any result. his claim was also rejected on the ground that he too could have availed of the remedy of filing an appeal to assail the orders passed by the recovery officer. the other applications which came up for hearing jointly were likewise dismissed as the said applicants had already availed of the appellate remedy before the $$$ bangalore. as against the above the application filed by anita international for possession of the property purchased by way of auction at the hands of the recovery officer was allowed. dissatisfied with the order passed by the company court the applicants raised a challenge to the order dated.passed in c.a. nos. of of and -of company petition no. of by filing o.s.a. nos. -and of. the impugned order in the present appeals dated.was passed by a division bench of the company court in the high court at madras. in arriving at its conclusions the high court took into consideration inter alia the following factors the official liquidator had raised objections before the recovery officer in respect of the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. there was nothing to indicate that the said objections were ever considered by the recovery officer. conversely the high court also arrived at the conclusion that the official liquidator who was the custodian of the properties of deve sugars ltd. consequent upon the official liquidator having taken possession of the assets of the company on.had failed to effectively protect the property of the company. no material had been placed before the high court to indicate that the valuation report dated.and the inventory dated.were prepared after giving notice to the official liquidator who was undoubtedly in exclusive custody of the properties which were subject matter of auction. even after the workers ' union had raised objections before the recovery officer no material was placed before the high court that there was proper application of mind at the hands of the recovery officer leading to the inference that the objections were rejected in a casual and lackadaisical manner. the inspection of the properties of the company under winding up by the inding purchasers for the auction sale scheduled on.was permitted only on $$$$ preceding the date of auction namely on.leading to the inference that the entire process of auction was a mere formality. on the advertised date fixed for the auction on.the recovery officer received only bids. despite the above he closed the bid on.itself. insofar as the above bids are concerned it was felt that there was for all ints and purposes only a singular bid. of the bidders was anita international -the $$$ herein and the other bid was by synergy steel ltd.sister company of the $$$ -anita international. in sum and substance therefore the recovery officer closed the bid after receiving a singular bid. after holding the auction on.the recovery officer confirmed the sale in favour of anita international on.. this could not have been d in view of the order dated.passed by the high court at madras wherein it was directed that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company under liquidation during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the $$$ bangalore. and as such the state bank of mysore could not have proceeded with the sale of the assets of deve sugars ltd. while dealing with the proposition of law declared by this court in the allahabad bank case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c wherein this court had unambiguously concluded that the provisions of the rdb act required debts recovery tribunals al to decide applications for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions. and wherein it was also held that the aforesaid responsibility included the adjudication of the liability of the debtor to banks and financial institutions as well as the execution of the recovery certificate by the recovery officer. in spite of the above it was submitted that the high court by relying on the judgment in m.v. $$$ v. vijaya bank $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c and after taking note of the fact that the state bank of mysore had applied to the company court of the high court at madras for liberty to recover its dues from deve sugars ltd.by filing company application nos. -of in pending company petition no. of and having obtained an order from the high court dated.was bound by the same. the high court also concluded that the above order dated.was binding on the recovery officer of the $$$ bangalore. the high court also expressed the view that the order dated.had unambiguously directed that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company under winding up. accordingly the high court held that the state bank of mysore could not take advantage of the sale of the assets of the company or the confirmation thereof at the hands of the recovery officer as the same were in clear violation of the order dated.of the company court in the high court at madras. relying on the decision of this court in the m.v. $$$ case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c the high court while referring to the findings recorded in paragraph of the above judgment concluded that since the assets of the company under winding up were under the physical charge of the official liquidator the official liquidator ought to have been associated with the auction proceedings conducted by the recovery officer. since the facts and circumstances of the present case reveal that the official liquidator was not allowed to be associated with the auction proceedings and even the valuation of the assets was taken without the knowledge of the official liquidator and further the objections raised by the official liquidator were rejected without due consideration the company court in the high court at madras concluded that the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. by the recovery officer on.was liable to be set aside. so also the confirmation of the sale by the recovery officer on.. having concluded as above the high court vide the impugned order dated.directed as under hence the following judgment is made:(i the auction sale in question is set aside;(ii the auction purchaser is entitled to refund of $$$$ paid by him towards the auction sale which is now set aside;(iii in the interest of all the creditors and also the workers ' union a fresh sale is ordered to be made by the recovery officer after following the procedural formalities and after preparation of a fresh valuation d by the panel of valuers appointed by the company court with the association of the official liquidator and on acceptance of the same by the company court in order to ensure a proper price is fetched for the assets of the company in liquidation. while assailing the impugned order passed by the high court dated.it was the vehement contion of learned counsel for the $$$ that the company court in the high court at madras had no jurisdiction in respect of the proceedings which fell within the legitimate domain of the rdb act. to canvass the above proposition learned counsel placed reliance on a number of judgments of this court. the submissions advanced in this behalf are being narrated hereunder:(i reliance was placed on the allahabad bank case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c. it was pointed out that the above judgment was rendered on.. and in the above view of the matter the declared position of law was clear and explicit well before the controversy in hand was determined by the high court at madras. from the cited judgment learned counsel for the $$$ placed reliance on the following observations:. in our opinion the jurisdiction of the tribunal in regard to adjudication is exclusive. the rdb act requires the tribunal al to decide applications for recovery of debts due to banks or financial institutions. once the tribunal passes an order that the debt is due the tribunal has to issue a certificate under section formerly under section to the recovery officer for recovery of the debt specified in the certificate. the question arises as to the meaning of the word recovery in section of the act. it appears to us that basically the tribunal is to adjudicate the liability of the defendant and then it has to issue a certificate under section. under section the jurisdiction of any other court or authority which would otherwise have had jurisdiction but for the provisions of the act is ousted and the power to adjudicate upon the liability is exclusively vested in the tribunal. this exclusion does not however apply to the jurisdiction of the supreme court or of a high court exercising power under $$$ or of the constitution.this is the effect of sections and of the act. we hold that the provisions of sections and of the rdb act are exclusive so far as the question of adjudication of the liability of the defendant to the $$$ bank is concerned.execution of certificate by recovery officer is his jurisdiction exclusive. even in regard to execution the jurisdiction of the recovery officer is exclusive. now a procedure has been laid down in the act for recovery of the debt as per the certificate issued by the tribunal and this procedure is contained in chapter v of the act and is covered by sections to. it is not $$$$ of the act that while the basic liability of the defendant is to be decided by the tribunal under section the banks / financial institutions should go to the civil court or the company court or some other authority outside the act for the actual realisation of the amount. the certificate granted under section has in our opinion to be executed only by the recovery officer. no dual jurisdictions at different stages are contemplated. further section of the act gives overriding effect to the provisions of the rdb act...xxx xxx xxxthe provisions of section clearly state that the rdb act overrides other laws to the ext of inconsiscy. in our opinion the prescription of an exclusive tribunal both for adjudication and execution is a procedure clearly inconsist with realisation of these debts in any other manner. there is more reason as to why it must be held that the jurisdiction of the recovery officer is exclusive. the tiwari committee which recommended the constitution of a special tribunal in for recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions stated in its report that the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal must relate not only in regard to the adjudication of the liability but also in regard to the execution proceedings. it stated in annexure xi of its report that all execution proceedings must be taken up only by the special tribunal under the act. in our opinion in view of the special procedure for recovery prescribed in chapter v of the act and section execution of the certificate is also within the exclusive jurisdiction of the recovery officer.xxx xxx xxxquestion of leave and control by the company court:0. learned attorney general has in this connection relied upon damji valji shah v. lic of india $$$ / $$$/00/$$$$$$$ / $$$/00/$$$$ $$$r to cond that for initiating and continuing proceedings under the rdb act no leave of the company court is necessary under section. in that case a tribunal was constituted under the life insurance corporation act. question was whether under section of the companies act. the said proceedings could be stayed and later be transferred to the company court and adjudicated in that court. it was held that the said proceedings could not be transferred. section of the life insurance corporation act -we may say roughly corresponds to section of the rdb act enabled life insurance corporation of india to file a case before a special tribunal and recover various amounts from the erstwhile life insurance companies in certain respects. section of the lic act conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the said tribunal just like section of the rdb act. there the company was ordered to be wound up by an order of the company court passed under section on --. the claim was filed by lic against the company and its directors before the tribunal in. the respondents before the tribunal conded that the claim could not have been filed in the tribunal without the leave of the company court under section. this court rejected the said contion and held that though the purpose of section was to enable the company court to transfer proceedings to itself and to dispose of the suit or proceedings so transferred unless the company court had jurisdiction to decide the questions which were raised before the lic tribunal there was no purpose of requiring leave of the company court or permitting transfer...xxx xxx xxx. it may also be noticed that in the lic act of there was no provision like section of the rdb act giving overriding effect to the provisions of the lic act. still this court upheld the exclusive jurisdiction of the lic tribunal...xxx xxx xxx. but the point here is that the occasion for such a claim by a secured creditor here canara bank against realisations by other creditors like allahabad bank under section read with proviso c to section ( can arise before the tribunal only if canara bank has stood outside winding -up and realised amounts and if it shows that out of the amounts privately realised by it some portion has been rateably taken away by the liquidator under $$$ a and of the proviso to section. it is only then that it can claim that it is to be reimbursed at the same level as a secured creditor with priority over the realisations of other creditors lying in the tribunal. n of these conditions is satisfied by canara bank. thus canara bank does not belong to the class of secured creditors covered by section.xxx xxx xxx. if n of the conditions required for applying section and section is therefore satisfied then the claim of canara bank before the tribunal can only be on the basis of principles underlying section $$$ of civil procedure. there being no decree in its favour from any court or from any tribunal and the other conditions of section not having been satisfied no dividend can be claimed out of monies realised at the instance of allahabad bank even if allahabad bank is an unsecured creditor.xxx xxx xxx. the next question is whether the amounts realised under the rdb act at the instance of the $$$ can be straight away released in its favour. now even if section read with section of the companies act does not help the respondent canara bank the said provisions can still have an impact on the $$$ allahabad bank which has no doubt a decree in its favour passed by the tribunal. its dues are unsecured. the workmen 's dues have priority over all other creditors secured and unsecured because of section. there is no material before us to hold that the workmen 's dues of the defendant company have all been paid. in view of the general principles laid down in national textile workers ' union v. p.r. $$$ / $$$/00/$$$ / $$$/00/ $$$c there is an obligation resting on this court to see that no secured or unsecured creditors including banks or financial institutions are paid before the workmen 's dues are paid. we are therefore unable to release any amounts in favour of the $$$ bank straight away.emphasis supplied)based on the above decision it was the contion of learned counsel for the $$$ that the company court in the high court at madras had neither the jurisdiction to grant liberty to the state bank of mysore to recover its dues from deve sugars ltd. by initiating proceedings under the rdb act nor the jurisdiction to interfere with the recovery proceedings by directing that no coercive steps would be taken against deve sugars ltd.during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the $$$ bangalore. stated simply learned counsel for the $$$ was emphatic that the order passed by the company court in the high court at madras dated.was jurisdictionally and legally impermissible and as such was liable to be ignored.reliance was also placed on andhra bank v. official liquidator $$$ / $$$/00/$$$$$$$ / $$$/00/$$$$ $$$c. the instant judgment was relied upon to support the conclusions drawn by learned counsel while placing reliance on the allahabad bank case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c. $$$ invited our attion to the position expressed in paragraph of the cited judgment which is extracted hereunder:. as regards point however this court at para of the judgment held the next question is whether the amounts realised under the rdb act at the instance of the $$$ can be straight away released in its favour. now even if section read with section of the companies act does not help the respondent canara bank the said provisions can still have an impact on the $$$ allahabad bank which has no doubt a decree in its favour passed by the tribunal. its dues are unsecured. the workmen 's dues ' have priority over all other creditors secured and unsecured because of section. there is no material before us to hold that the workmen 's dues of the defendant company have all been paid. in view of the general principles laid down in national textile workers ' union v. p.r. $$$ / $$$/00/$$$ / $$$/00/ $$$c there is an obligation resting on this court to see that no secured or unsecured creditors including banks or financial institutions are paid before the workmen 's dues are paid. we are therefore unable to release any amounts in favour of the $$$ bank straight away.emphasis supplied)(iii in chronological order learned counsel next relied upon the judgment in rajasthan state financial corporation v. official liquidator $$$ / $$$//$$$$$$$ / $$$//$$$$ $$$c and drew the court 's attion to the following:. in a.p. state financial corpn. v. official liquidator $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c this court held that the company judge while permitting the financial corporation to stay outside the liquidation proceedings rightly imposed conditions to ensure that the corporation would discharge its liability due to workers under section of the companies act inform the official liquidator in advance about the proposed sale of properties of the indebted companies and iii would obtain the court 's permission before finalising the ders. this court specifically overruled the view taken by the high court that it was not necessary for the financial corporations to seek permission of the company court to stay outside the winding -up proceedings. it was held that sections and of the companies act had overriding effect and the amendment being later in point of time the non obstante clause therein would prevail over the non obstante clause contained in section of the sfc act. in international coach builders ltd. v. karnataka state financial corpn. $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c this court considered the correctness of the views expressed by the karnataka high court and the gujarat high court. this court held that a right is available to a financial corporation under section of the sfc act against a debtor if a company only so long as there is no order of winding up. when the debtor is a company in winding up the rights of financial corporations are affected by the provisions in sections and of the companies act. it was also held that the proviso to section of the companies act creates a pari passu charge in favour of the workmen to the ext of their dues and makes the liquidator the representative of the workmen to enforce such a charge. the decision of the bombay high court in maharashtra state financial corpn. v. official liquidator was approved. the reference to a larger bench was occasid by the fact that the decision in allahabad bank v. canara bank was not adverted to in this decision. this decision recognises that whether a creditor is standing outside the winding up or not the distribution of the proceeds has to be in terms of section of the companies act read with section of that act in a case where the debtor is a company -in -liquidation. as far as we can see there is no conflict on the question of the applicability of section read with section of the companies act to cases where the debtor is a company and is in liquidation. the conflict if any is in the view that the debts recovery tribunal could sell the properties of the company in terms of the recovery of debts act. this view was taken in allahabad bank v. canara bank in view of the recovery of debts act being a subsequent legislation and being a special law which would prevail over the general law the companies act. this argument is not available as far as the sfc act is concerned since section was introduced by act of and the overriding provision therein would prevail over the sfc act of as amended in and notwithstanding section of the sfc act. as regards distribution of assets there is no conflict. it seems to us that whether the assets are realised by a secured creditor even if it be by proceeding under the sfc act or under the recovery of debts act the distribution of the assets could only be in terms of section of the act and by recognising the right of the liquidator to calculate the workmen 's dues and collect it for distribution among them pari passu with the secured creditors. the official liquidator representing a ranked secured creditor working under the control of the company court can not therefore be kept out of the process. thus on the authorities what emerges is that once a winding -up proceeding has commenced and the liquidator is put in charge of the assets of the company being wound up the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the assets held at the instance of the financial institutions coming under the recovery of debts act or of financial corporations coming under the sfc act can only be with the association of the official liquidator and under the supervision of the company court. the right of a financial institution or of the recovery tribunal or that of a financial corporation or the court which has been approached under section of the sfc act to sell the assets may not be taken away but the same stands restricted by the requirement of the official liquidator being associated with it giving the company court the right to ensure that the distribution of the assets in terms of section of the companies act takes place. in the case on hand admittedly the $$$s have not set in motion any proceeding under the sfc act. what we have is only a liquidation proceeding pending and the secured creditors the financial corporations approaching the company court for permission to stand outside the winding up and to sell the properties of the company -in -liquidation. the company court has rightly directed that the sale be held in association with the official liquidator representing the workmen and that the proceeds will be held by the official liquidator until they are distributed in terms of section of the companies act under its supervision. the directions thus made clearly are consist with the provisions of the relevant acts and the views expressed by this court in the decisions referred to above. in this situation we find no reason to interfere with the decision of the high court. we clarify that there is no inconsiscy between the decisions in allahabad bank v. canara bank and in international coach builders ltd. v. karnataka state financial corpn. in respect of the applicability of sections and of the companies act in the matter of distribution among the creditors. the right to sell under the sfc act or under the recovery of debts act by a creditor coming within those acts and standing outside the winding up is different from the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the security. the distribution in a case where the debtor is a company in the process of being wound up can only be in terms of section read with section of the companies act. after all the liquidator represents the entire body of creditors and also holds a right on behalf of the workers to have a distribution pari passu with the secured creditors and the duty for further distribution of the proceeds on the basis of the preferences contained in section of the companies act under the directions of the company court. in other words the distribution of the sale proceeds under the direction of the company court is his responsibility. to ensure the proper working out of the scheme of distribution it is necessary to associate the official liquidator with the process of sale so that he can ensure in the light of the directions of the company court that a proper price is fetched for the assets of the company -in -liquidation. it was in that context that the rights of the official liquidator were discussed in international coach builders ltd. the debts recovery tribunal and the district court entertaining an application under section of the sfc act should issue notice to the liquidator and hear him before ordering a sale as the representative of the creditors in general. in the light of the discussion as above we think it proper to sum up the legal position thus:(i a debts recovery tribunal acting under the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act. would be entitled to order the sale and to sell the properties of the debtor even if a company -in -liquidation through its recovery officer but only after notice to the official liquidator or the liquidator appointed by the company court and after hearing him.a district court entertaining an application under section of the sfc act will have the power to order sale of the assets of a borrower company -in -liquidation but only after notice to the official liquidator or the liquidator appointed by the company court and after hearing him.if a financial corporation acting under section of the sfc act seeks to sell or otherwise transfer the assets of a debtor company -in -liquidation the said power could be exercised by it only after obtaining the appropriate permission from the company court and acting in terms of the directions issued by that court as regards associating the official liquidator with the sale the fixing of the upset price or the reserve price confirmation of the sale holding of the sale proceeds and the distribution thereof among the creditors in terms of section and section of the companies act.in a case where proceedings under the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act. or the sfc act are not set in motion the creditor concerned is to approach the company court for appropriate directions regarding the realisation of its securities consist with the relevant provisions of the companies act regarding distribution of the assets of the company -in -liquidation.emphasis supplied)relying on the above judgment learned counsel for the $$$ emphatically pointed out that the sale of the properties of a company in liquidation should not be confused with the distribution of the sale proceeds of the company in liquidation amongst its creditors. it was submitted that there could be no interference with the right of the recovery officer to sell the assets of the company in liquidation under the provisions of the rdb act. but that had nothing to do with the distribution of the proceeds of the sale. the distribution of the sale proceeds ought to be in consonance with the provisions of the companies act wherein the debtor was a company in liquidation.learned counsel then placed reliance on the m.v. $$$ case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c. he invited the court 's attion to the following:. so far as the order passed by the learned company judge is concerned it specifically and unequivocally stated that permission of the court should be obtained before sale is confirmed or finalised. that order was passed as early as on --. in an order dated --also it was expressly mentid that the sale was subject to confirmation of the court. it was an express condition imposed by the company court and as such it was not open to the recovery officer to confirm the sale and such order which was having no authority of law was rightly set aside by the company judge and no grievance could be made.xxx $$$. our attion has been invited by the learned counsel to the relevant orders passed by the company court from time to time. so far as the order dated --is concerned permission to sell the property was granted on certain terms and conditions. they read as under:(a the official liquidator shall be allowed to have inspection of the properties and assets of the company in liquidation and to take inventory as and when required.b certified copy of the judgment and decree passed by the $$$ordinate judge bhongir in os no. of dated --shall be made available to the official liquidator without delay.c the certified copy of the order that would be passed by the debts recovery tribunal bangalore shall be made available to the official liquidator without avoidable delay.d the $$$ bank shall file the valuer 's report in the court before the properties covered under the mortgage deed are put to sale.e permission of this court

an order dated --in company application no. of was equally clear. it reads as under this is an application filed by the nationalised bank seeking permission of this court to receive the valuation report and also to permit the bank to effect sale of the properties of the company under liquidation through the recovery officer of the debts recovery tribunal in terms of the conditions of auction -sale notice dated --.it is also stated that though sale notice was ordered no sale was conducted as no permission was obtained from this court. the official liquidator also filed a report reporting that there is no objection as to the proposed auction and also the valuation report as filed by the applicant company.under the above circumstances the applicant company is permitted to go ahead with the proposed sale of the assets of the company under liquidation through public auction. but however the said sale if any effected shall be subject to the confirmation of this court. the applicant is accordingly granted permission to effect the sale but the sale shall be required to be confirmed by this court.the application is accordingly disposed of.the above orders leave no room of doubt that the bank was permitted to go ahead with the proposed sale of the assets of the company under liquidation by way of auction but such sale was subject to confirmation by the company court. it is therefore clear that all parties were aware about the condition as to confirmation of sale by the company court. it was therefore not open to the recovery officer to confirm sale. the order passed and action taken by the recovery officer was in clear violation of and inconsist with the specific condition imposed by the company court. in our considered opinion therefore the $$$ can not take any advantage of confirmation of sale by the recovery officer who did not possess the power to confirm sale.xxx xxx. it is true that when the company judge set aside the sale on --the order was reversed by the division bench of the high court since it was in breach of natural justice. that does not however mean that the company court could not pass fresh order after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties. in our opinion the company court was right in passing fresh order after hearing the parties. if the recovery officer could not have confirmed the sale obviously all actions taken in pursuance of confirmation of sale such as issuance of sale certificate registration of documents etc. would be of no consequence. since the company was in liquidation and official liquidator was in charge of the assets of the company he ought to have been associated with the auction proceedings which was not d. this is also clear from the report submitted by the official liquidator and on that ground also the auction -sale was liable to be set aside.emphasis supplied)based on the conclusions drawn in the above judgment it was submitted that there can be no doubt that in a matter where the company court had passed an order restraining the recovery officer confirming the sale the sale made by the recovery officer in execution of the recovery certificate could only have been confirmed with the permission of the court. here again learned counsel has drawn a fine distinction. it was asserted that even in the above judgment this court had not disputed nor disturbed the exclusive jurisdiction of the recovery officer in executing a recovery certificate.last of all learned counsel placed reliance on official liquidator uttar pradesh and uttarakhand v. allahabad bank $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c and drew our attion to the following conclusions recorded therein:. from the aforesaid verdict it is vivid that the larger bench in rajasthan state financial corpn. case approved the law laid down in allahabad bank. in fact it is noticeable that the larger bench has observed that in allahabad bank case a view has been taken that the rdb act being a subsequent legislation and being a special law would prevail over the general law the act but the said argument is not available as far as the sfc act is concerned.xxx xxx xxx. from the aforesaid authorities it clearly emerges that the sale has to be conducted by $$$ with the association of the official liquidator. we may has to clarify that as the present controversy only relates to the sale we are not going to say anything with regard to the distribution. however it is noticeable that under section of the rdb act the legislature has clearly stated that distribution has to be d in accordance with section of the act. the purpose of stating so is that it is a complete code in itself and the tribunal has the exclusive jurisdiction for the purpose of sale of the properties for realisation of the dues of the banks and financial institutions.xxx xxx xxx. the aforesaid analysis makes it luculent that $$$ has exclusive jurisdiction to sell the properties in a proceeding instituted by the banks or financial institutions but at the time of auction and sale it is required to associate the official liquidator. the said principle has also been reiterated in $$$ v. central bank of india $$$ / $$$/00/0$$$ / $$$/00/0 $$$c. once the official liquidator is associated needless to say he has a role to see that there is no irregularity in conducting the auction and appropriate price is obtained by holding an auction in a fair transparent and non -arbitrary manner in consonance with the rules framed under the rdb act.$$$. we have referred to the said passage from delhi high court bar assn. case for the purpose of highlighting that an appeal lies to $$$ challenging the action of the recovery officer. in the case at hand the official liquidator was not satisfied with the manner in which the auction was conducted and he thought it apposite to report to the learned company judge who set aside the auction. needless to emphasise the official liquidator has a role under the act. he protects the interests of the workmen and the creditors and hence his association at the time of auction and sale has been thought appropriate by this court. to put it differently he has been conferred locus to put forth his stand in the said matters. therefore any who is aggrieved by any act d by the recovery officer can prefer an appeal. such a statutory mode is provided under the rdb act which is a special enactment. $$$ has the powers under the rdb act to make an enquiry as it deems fit and confirm modify or set aside the order made by the recovery officer in exercise of powers under sections to both inclusive of the rdb act. thus the auction sale and challenge are completely codified under the rdb act regard being had to the special nature of the legislation.emphasis supplied). in addition to the aforesaid submissions mr. s. $$$ senior advocate also assisted us in the matter. he supported the above contions but sought a little intervention by requiring us to also examine the scope of the controversy under consideration by placing reliance on the judgment of this court in sadashiv prasad singh v. $$$ / $$$/00/0$$$ / $$$/00/0 $$$c. $$$ invited our attion to the scope of interference with reference to a public auction wherein party rights have emerged especially when the parties are independent of the disputants and also with reference to seeking recourse to a statutory remedy available to a party against the impugned order. the conclusions recorded by this court in the sadashiv prasad singh case $$$ / $$$/00/0$$$ / $$$/00/0 $$$c as were pointedly brought to our notice are being extracted hereunder:. at the time of hearing we were thinking of remanding the matter to the recovery officer to investigate into the objection of harender singh under rule of the second schedule to the income tax act. but considering the delay such a remand may cause we have ourselves examined the objections of harender singh and rejected the objections for a variety of reasons:. firstly the contion raised at the hands of the respondents before the high court that the facts narrated by harender singh the $$$ in special leave petition c no. of were a total sham as he was actually the brother of of the judgment -debtors namely $$$. and that harender singh had created an unbelievable story with the connivance and help of his brother so as to save the property in question. the claim of harender singh in his objection petition was based on an unregistered agreement to sell dated --. not only that such an agreement to sell would not vest any legal right in his favour it is apparent that it may not have been difficult for him to have had the aforesaid agreement to sell notarised in connivance with his brother for the purpose sought to be achieved..  it is apparent from the factual position depicted in the foregoing paragraphs that harender singh despite his having filed objections before the recovery officer had abandd the contest raised by him by not appearing and by not being represented before the recovery officer after --whereas the recovery officer had passed the order of sale of the property by way of public auction more than years thereafter only on --. having abandd his claim before the recovery officer it was not open to him to have reagitated the same by filing a writ petition before the high court.. thirdly a remedy of appeal was available to harender singh in respect of the order of the recovery officer assailed by him before the high court under section which is being extracted herein to assail the order dated --. appeal against the order of recovery officer.notwithstanding anything contained in section any person aggrieved by an order of the recovery officer made under this act may within days from the date on which a copy of the order is issued to him prefer an appeal to the tribunal.on receipt of an appeal under $$$ -section the tribunal may after giving an opportunity to the $$$ to be heard and after making such inquiry as it deems fit confirm modify or set aside the order made by the recovery officer in exercise of his powers under sections to both inclusive.the high court ought not to have interfered with in the matter agitated by harender singh in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. in fact the learned single judge rightfully dismissed the writ petition filed by harender singh.. fourthly harender singh could not be allowed to raise a challenge to the public auction held on --because he had not raised any objection to the attachment of the property in question or the proclamations and notices issued in newspapers in connection with the auction thereof.. all these facts cumulatively lead to the conclusion that after --harender singh had lost all interest in the property in question and had therefore remained a silent spectator to various orders which came to be passed from time to time. he had therefore no equitable right in his favour to assail the auction -purchase made by sadashiv prasad sinha on --.. finally the public auction under reference was held on --. $$$ the same was confirmed on --. possession of the property was handed over to the auction -purchaser sadashiv prasad sinha on --. the auction -purchaser initiated mutation proceedings in respect of the property in question. harender singh did not raise any objections in the said mutation proceedings. the said mutation proceedings were also finalised in favour of sadashiv prasad sinha. harender singh approached the high court through cwjc no. of only on --. we are of the view that the challenged raised by harender singh ought to have been rejected on the grounds of delay and laches especially because -party rights had emerged in the meantime. more so because the auction -purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for consideration having purchased the property in furtherance of a duly publicised public auction interference by the high court even on the ground of equity was clearly uncalled for. for the reasons recorded hereinabove we are of the view that the impugned order dated --passed by the high court allowing letters pat appeal no. of deserves to be set aside. the same is accordingly set aside. the right of the $$$ sadashiv prasad sinha in plot no. exhibition road ps gandhi maidan patna measuring sq ft is hereby confirmed. in the above view of the matter while the appeal preferred by sadashiv prasad sinha stands allowed the filed by harender singh is hereby dismissed.emphasis supplied)based on the conclusions recorded in the above judgment it was conded that the $$$ bangalore issued the recovery certificate on.thereupon the auction sale was conducted on.and there having been no objection to the same the auction sale was confirmed by the recovery officer on.. it was submitted that after a lapse of $$$$ after all payments were made and the sale was confirmed there was no equitable justification to interfere with the same. insofar as the submission pertaining to the availability of a statutory remedy against the impugned order is concerned learned senior counsel referred to the directions issued by the high court of karnataka while disposing of $$$ no. of gm -$$$ preferred by videocon international ltd. and $$$. ltd. and $$$ no. of gm -$$$ preferred by tungbhadra sugar works mazdoor sangh -the workers ' union referred to in the narration of facts hereinabove and drew our attion to the observations of the high court in its order dated.which are being extracted hereunder:0. in the circumstances. i am of the view that there is an alternate and efficacious remedy by way of an appeal under the debts recovery act r / w procedure for recovery of tax. the $$$ shall avail the alternate remedy within $$$$ weeks from $$$$. it is needless to say that the matter shall not be precipitated until the appeal filed by the $$$s is disposed of. all the contions are left upon.emphasis supplied)based on the above it was conded that it was not open to the $$$s to raise a challenge with reference to a party sale especially when the same was in the nature of a public auction conducted by a recovery officer while giving effect to an order passed by the debts recovery tribunal strictly within the jurisdiction of the provisions of the rdb act. and also the determination of this court not to interfere lightly with the rights which came to be vested in such auction purchasers. insofar as the appellate remedy of the contesting parties is concerned reliance was placed on section of the rdb act which is extracted hereunder:0. appeal against the order of recovery officer.-notwithstanding anything contained in section any person aggrieved by an order of the recovery officer made under this act may within days from the date on which a copy of the order is issued to him prefer an appeal to the tribunal.on receipt of an appeal under $$$ -section the tribunal may after giving an opportunity to the $$$ to be heard and after making such inquiry as it deems fit confirm modify or set aside the order made by the recovery officer in exercise of his powers under sections to both inclusive.based on the above provision it was the submission of learned senior counsel that the wrong if any caused to the contesting respondents could have been set right only under section of the rdb act. mr. c.a. sundaram senior advocate endeavoured to repudiate the submissions advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the $$$s by advancing contions. firstly an order passed by a court with jurisdiction having attained finality was binding between the concerned parties and was liable to be complied with under all circumstances. in reference to the instant submission the assertion of learned counsel was that the order dated.passed by the high court at madras had been passed by a court having jurisdiction. the said order had attained finality. and accordingly there was no justification at the hands of any other party concerned to wriggle out of the same.  even if an order is passed by a court which has no jurisdiction with reference to a controversy and as such could be termed as a void order the order of the court would continue to remain enforceable in law till the same is set aside and/or vacated by a subsequent order. insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned it was submitted that the order dated.having attained finality and having not been varied or vacated was binding between the parties and as such its compliance was mandatory. thirdly any sale made within the teeth of an injunction was liable to be set aside. an injunction order according to learned senior counsel as in the instant case the order dated.which mandated that no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of deve sugars ltd.. during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the tribunal..namely the $$$ bangalore was binding. the auction sale conducted on.and its subsequent confirmation on.according to learned senior counsel were not only beyond the jurisdiction of the recovery officer but also beyond the jurisdiction of the debts recovery tribunal. in the instant view of the matter it was conded that the impugned order dated.passed by the high court at madras ought not to be interfered with. while substantiating the contion noticed in the foregoing paragraph it was asserted that for recovery of a debt due to a bank it can file a winding up petition before a company court under the companies act or alternatively it can file a recovery petition before the jurisdictional debts recovery tribunal under the provisions of the rdb act. accordingly it was pointed out that a recovery suit could be withdrawn to a company court and the recovery of the debt sought by the bank could be agitated before the company court. it was however pointed out that the inverse was not permissible inasmuch as a winding up petition filed before the company court under the companies act could not be withdrawn to a debts recovery tribunal under the provisions of the rdb act. it was therefore the contion of learned counsel for the respondents that since the state bank of mysore could seek recourse to the $$$ as well as the company court as may be considered suitable or appropriate the proceedings filed by the state bank of mysore namely company application nos. -of in pending company petition no. of and company petition no. of had been filed by the state bank of mysore before a court having jurisdiction. and therefore a court having jurisdiction in the matter at the instance of the state bank of mysore had passed the order dated.. by the order dated.the company court in the high court at madras allowed the prayer made by the state bank of mysore to continue to proceed with the recovery proceedings initiated by it before the $$$ bangalore. but while granting the above leave imposed conditions the official liquidator would be impleaded before the $$$ and no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company -deve sugars ltd.during or after the proceedings before the $$$. the said order was neither varied nor vacated. the same according to learned counsel was binding between the parties. and therefore it was conded that the same could not have been ignored or overlooked. it was submitted that even if the above order dated.was without jurisdiction and/or void the same would be equally binding till it was varied or set aside by a court having compet jurisdiction. based on the factual position noticed above it was asserted that the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd.was clearly in the teeth of the injunction order passed by the company court on.and as such was liable to be set aside. in order to repudiate the submissions advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the $$$ based on the judgment rendered by this court in the allahabad bank case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c reliance was placed on industrial credit and investment corporation of india ltd. v. srinivas agencies $$$ / $$$//$$$$$$$ / $$$//$$$$ $$$c and the court 's attion was drawn to the factual and legal position expressed therein:. the ext of right of secured creditors to realise their debts from the assets of a company which is under winding up or has been wound up by approaching fora other than the company court is required to be spelt out in these appeals. we have also been called upon to decide as to when a pending suit or proceeding relating to realization of the debts by such a creditor should be transferred to itself by a company court seized with the winding -up proceeding.xxx xxx xxx. a combined reading of the aforesaid provisions leads to the following results:(i a winding -up court has jurisdiction inter alia to entertain or dispose of any suit or proceeding by or against the company even if such suit or proceeding had been instituted before an order for winding up had been made. this apart the winding -up court has jurisdiction to transfer such a suit or proceeding to itself and dispose of the same. these follow from $$$ -sections and of section.when a winding -up order has been made or the official liquidator has been appointed as provisional liquidator no suit or other legal proceeding even if pending at the date of the winding -up order can proceed against the company except by leave of the company court vide $$$ -section of section.any sale held even without the leave of the winding -up court pursuant to order of a civil court on it being approached by a secured creditor to realise its debt will not ipso facto be void in view of the holding in ranganathan case that section dealing with voidness of sale operates when the sale is pursuant to attachment of company court. this however would be the position where a company has not been wound up but is in the process of being wound up. n of the parties has assailed the aforesaid propositions of law as well. the real b of contion is as to when leave of the winding -up court should be granted to a secured creditor to proceed with the suit after an order of winding up has been made and when should a winding -up court transfer to itself any suit or proceeding by or against the company during the pendency of the winding -up proceeding. the aforesaid questions arise because a secured creditor who has initiated a suit or proceeding in a civil court is interested in realisation of his debt only whereas the company court looks after the interest of all the creditors so too the workmen 's dues which rank pari passu with debts due to secured creditors. this is brought home not only by section which was inserted by the companies amendment act. but also by the proviso to $$$ -section of section inserted by the same amendment act. the winding -up court does these acts through a liquidator who has been given wide powers by section of the act. as against this a receiver appointed by a civil court on being approached by secured creditor would basically look after the interest of that creditor whose interest may in many cases be in conflict with that of the liquidator as was acknowledged in karamelli & barnett ltd.in re. we feel no difficulty in stating that in case of such conflict the interest of liquidator has to receive precedence over that of the receiver inasmuch as the former looks after the interest of a large segment of creditors along with that of workmen whereas the latter confines his concern to the interest of the secured creditor on whose approach the receiver has been appointed. this view can not also be and has indeed not been contested by the learned counsel appearing for the $$$s.xxx xxx xxx. shri salve 's entire submission had been that a working principle may be got evolved which would on the hand protect the substantive right of a secured creditor specially in view of large sums of my being advanced of late of such creditors and on the other hand not jeopardise the interest of other secured creditors. according to the learned counsel these twin objects can be achieved if the company court were to grant leave wherever required as a rule subject to reasonable conditions. this would preserve the integrity of the substantive right of the secured creditor. the terms to be imposed should facilitate rather than obstruct the realisation of security. further wherever a receiver has been appointed prior to the commencement of the winding -up proceedings he should be permitted to continue in general run of cases. as to the suits to be filed after the winding -up proceeding has commenced the learned counsel urged that such a permission should normally be granted by the winding -up court. on this being d when the question of appointment of receiver would arise the civil court would do so if a case for same were to be made out after hearing the liquidator who would be a defendant in the suit. as regards transfer of the pending suit by the company court the submission was that convenience may not be the guiding factor the preservation of integrity of the substantive right of the creditor should be the main consideration. to buttress his submission shri salve has referred us to the recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act which was recently enacted because of the considerable difficulty being experienced by financial institutions in recovering loans and enforcement securities charged with them. earlier recovery procedure used to block a significant portion of their funds in unproductive assets the value of which deteriorates with the passage of time. an urgent need was therefore felt for successful implementation of the financial sector reforms to work out a suitable mechanism through which dues to these institutions could be realised without delay. to achieve this purpose the aforesaid act visualises establishment of the debts recovery tribunal(s by the central government with its own procedure which is speedy in nature. section of this act has barred jurisdiction of other courts except the writ power of the higher courts in relation to the matters specified in section --the same being recovery of debts due to such institutions.xxx xxx. we are therefore of the view that the approach to be adopted in this regard by the company court does not deserve to be put in a strait -jacket formula. the discretion to be exercised in this regard has to depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. while exercising this power we have no doubt that the company court would also bear in mind the rationale behind the enactment of recovery of debts due to the banks and financial institutions act to which reference has been made above. we make the same observation regarding the terms which a company court should like to impose while granting leave. it need not be stated that the terms to be imposed have to be reasonable which would of course vary from case to case. according to us such an approach would maintain the integrity of that secured creditor who had approached the civil court or desires to do so and would take care of the interest of other secured creditors as well which the company court is duty -bound to do. the company court shall also apprise itself about the fact whether dues of workmen are outstanding if so ext of the same. it would be seen whether after the assets of the company are allowed to be used to satisfy the debt of the secured creditor it would be possible to satisfy the workmen 's dues pari passu.emphasis supplied). on the jurisdictional aspect learned senior counsel for the respondents placed reliance on clauses and of section of the companies act. the same are reproduced below:. suits stayed on winding up order.when a winding up order has been made or the official liquidator has been appointed as provisional liquidator no suit or other legal proceeding shall be commenced or if pending at the date of the winding up order shall be proceeded with against the company except by leave of the tribunal and subject to such terms as the tribunal may impose.tribunal shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force have jurisdiction to entertain or dispose of-(a any suit or proceeding by or against the company;(b any claim made by or against the company including claims by or against any of its branches in india);(c any application made under section by or in respect of the company;(d any question of priorities or any other question whatsoever whether of law or fact which may relate to or rise in course of the winding up of the company whether such suit or proceeding has been instituted or is instituted or such claim or question has arisen or arises or such application has been made or is made before or after the order for the winding up of the company or before or after the commencement of the companies amendment act... with reference to the judgment rendered in the allahabad bank case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c it was asserted that this court had merely concluded that it was not necessary for a bank or a financial institution to seek leave of company court before initiating proceedings against a debtor under the provisions of the rdb act. it was therefore pointed out that there was no dissimilarity of the conclusions drawn by this court in the allahabad bank case $$$ / $$$/0/$$$$$$$ / $$$/0/$$$$ $$$c and the srinivas agencies case $$$ / $$$//$$$$$$$ / $$$//$$$$ $$$c. in addition to the above learned senior counsel for the respondents placed reliance on krishnadevi $$$ v. bombay environmental action group $$$ / $$$/00/$$$$$$$ / $$$/00/$$$$ $$$c and placed reliance on the following conclusions drawn therein:. it is a settled legal proposition that even if an order is void it requires to be so declared by a compet forum and it is not permissible for any person to ignore the same merely because in his opinion the order is void. in state of kerala v. m.k. kunhikannan nambiar manjeri $$$ $$$. bagasarwalla v. hind rubber industries p ltd.m. meenakshi v. $$$ and sneh gupta v. devi sarup this court held that whether an order is valid or void can not be determined by the parties. for setting aside such an order even if void the party has to approach the appropriate forum. in state of punjab v. gurdev singh this court held that a party aggrieved by the invalidity of an order has to approach the court for relief of declaration that the order against him is inoperative and therefore not binding upon him. while deciding the said case this court placed reliance upon the judgment in smith v. east elloe rdc wherein lord $$$ observed ac pp. -.. an order even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal consequences. it bears no brand of invalidity on its forehead. unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset it will remain as effective for its ossible purpose as the most impeccable of orders. in sultan sadik v. $$$ $$$ba $$$ / $$$ / $$$/000/00 air $$$ this court took a similar view observing that once an order is declared non est by the court only then the judgment of nullity would operate erga omnes i. for and against every concerned. such a declaration is permissible if the court comes to the conclusion that the author of the order lacks inherent jurisdiction / compece and therefore it comes to the conclusion that the order suffers from pat and lat invalidity. thus from the above it emerges that even if the order / notification is void / voidable the party aggrieved by the same can not decide that the said order / notification is not binding upon it. it has to approach the court for seeking such declaration. the order may be hypothetically a nullity and even if its invalidity is challenged before the court in a given circumstance the court may refuse to quash the same on various grounds including the standing of the $$$ or on the ground of delay or on the doctrine of waiver or any other legal reason. the order may be void for purpose or for person it may not be so for another purpose or another person.emphasis supplied). in addition to the above reliance was placed on $$$ xxi rule of the $$$ of civil procedure which is extracted below:. adjudication of claims to or objections to attachment of property.where any claims preferred to or any objection is made to the attachment of any property attached in execution of a decree on the ground that such property is not liable to such attachment the court shall proceed to adjudicate upon the claim or objection in accordance with the provisions herein contained $$$ that no such claim or objection shall be entertained-(a where before the claim is preferred or objection is made the property attached has already been sold where the court considers that the claim or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed.all questions including questions relating to right title or interest in the property attached arising between the parties to a proceeding or their representatives under this rule and relevant to the adjudication of the claim or objection shall be determined by the court dealing with the claim or objection and not by a separate suit.upon the determination of the questions referred to in $$$ -rule the court shall in accordance with such determination,-(a allow the claim or objection and release the property from attachment either wholly or to such ext as it thinks fit disallow the claim or objection or(c continue the attachment subject to any mortgage charge of other interest in favour of any person pass such order as in the circumstances of the case it deems fit.where any claim or objection has been adjudicated upon under this rule the order made thereon shall have the same force and be subject to the same conditions as to appeal or otherwise as if it were a decree.where a claim or an objection is preferred and the court under the proviso to $$$ -rule refuses to entertain it the party against whom such order is made may institute a suit to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute but subject to the result of such suit if any an order so refusing to entertain the claim or objection shall be conclusive.based on the above provision it was submitted that a declaration of illegality could only be prospective. and therefore what had to be decided was whether the sale proceedings conducted on.and the confirmation thereof on.were valid it was submitted that even if for arguments sake the order dated.passed by the company court of the high court at madras was now to be set aside the same would not validate the aforementid illegality and unauthorized actions of the recovery officer for giving effect to the recovery certificate issued by the $$$. to support the aforementid proposition learned senior counsel placed reliance on the official liquidator uttar pradesh and uttarakhand case $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc and drew the attion of this court to the factual position recorded in paragraphs and thereof which are reproduced hereunder:. $$$ being had to the controversy involved which is in the realm of pure question of law it is not necessary to exposit the facts in detail. hence the necessitous facts are adumbrated herein. the respondent allahabad bank a secured creditor with whom certain properties were mortgaged filed original application no. of under section of the rdb act for recovery of a sum of rs. with interest from the company namely m / s. rajindra pipes ltd.which was decreed by the debts recovery tribunal $$$ $$$ vide its order dated --. the debt recovery certificate being drc no. of was issued for recovery of the aforesaid amount which was subsequently transferred to $$$ at allahabad. be it noted company petition no. of was filed before the learned company judge in the high court of judicature at allahabad who vide order dated --had passed an order for winding up of the company as a consequence of which the official liquidator had taken over the possession of the assets of the company on --. after receipt of the recovery certificate the recovery officer attached the immovable properties of the wound -up company by order dated --. the movable properties of the company were attached as per order dated --. at this juncture allahabad bank filed an application before the company court for impleading it as a necessary party and protect its rights getting it out of the winding -up proceedings. a prayer was made before the company court to grant permission to proceed with the sale of the attached properties by the recovery officer debts recovery tribunal $$$. the learned company judge on --granted permission for proceeding with the attachment and sale of the assets for recovery of the dues under the rdb act. it is worth stating here that no condition was imposed. after auction and confirmation of sale by $$$ the auction -purchaser filed an application before the learned company judge for issuance of a direction to the official liquidator to give physical possession. the company court by order dated --set aside the sale certificate on the ground that the official liquidator was neither heard in the matter nor was he given an opportunity to represent before the recovery officer for the purposes of representing the workmen 's dues and a portion of the workmen 's liability under section of the act. a direction was issued to the recovery officer to proceed to sell the assets only after associating the official liquidator and after giving him hearing to represent the claims of the workmen.the aforementid controversy was adjudicated and disposed of by this court after making a reference to the judgment in the allahabad bank case $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc by concluding as under:. it has been submitted by mr. $$$ learned $$$ that if the company court as well as $$$ can exercise jurisdiction in respect of the same auction or sale after adjudication by $$$ there would be duality of exercise of jurisdiction which the rdb act does not envisage. by way of an example the learned senior counsel has submitted that there are some categories of persons who can go before $$$ challenging the sale and if the official liquidator approaches the company court then such a situation would only bring anarchy in the realm of adjudication. the aforesaid submission of the learned senior counsel commends acceptance as $$$$ of the legislature is that the dues of the banks and financial institutions are realised in promptitude. it is to be noted that when there is inflation in the economy the value of the mortgaged property / assets depreciates with the efflux of time. if more time is consumed it would be really difficult on the part of the banks and financial institutions to realise their dues. therefore this court in allahabad bank case has opined that it is $$$ which would have the exclusive jurisdiction when a matter is agitated before $$$. the dictum in the said case has been approved by the -judge bench in rajasthan state financial corpn. it is not a situation where the official liquidator can have a choice either to approach $$$ or the company court. the language of the rdb act being clear provides that any person aggrieved can prefer an appeal. the official liquidator whose association is mandatorily required can indubitably be regarded as a person aggrieved relating to the action taken by the recovery officer which would include the manner in which the auction is conducted or the sale is confirmed. under these circumstances the official liquidator can not even take recourse to the doctrine of election. it is difficult to conceive that there are remedies. it is well settled in law that if there is only remedy the doctrine of election does not apply and we are disposed to think that the official liquidator has only remedy i. to challenge the order passed by the recovery officer before $$$. be it noted an order passed under section of the rdb act by $$$ is appealable. thus we are inclined to conclude and hold that the official liquidator can only take recourse to the mode of appeal and further appeal under the rdb act and not approach the company court to set aside the auction or confirmation of sale when a sale has been confirmed by the recovery officer under the rdb act. we will be failing in our duty if we do not take notice of the decision in m.v. $$$ wherein the sale was set aside by the company judge. it may be stated here that the company court had imposed a condition that the permission of the company court shall be obtained before the sale of the properties immovable or movable is confirmed or finalised. on the aforesaid basis this court opined that when the bank was permitted to go ahead with the proposed sale of the assets of the company under liquidation by way of auction but such sale was subject to confirmation by the company court and all the parties were aware about the condition as to confirmation of sale by the company court it was not open to the recovery officer to confirm the sale and therefore the sale was set aside by the company court being in violation of the order. thus we find that the facts in the said case were absolutely different and further this court did not deal with the jurisdiction of the company court vis -a -vis $$$ as the said issue really did not arise. hence it is not an authority for the proposition that the official liquidator can approach the company court to set aside the auction or sale conducted by the recovery officer of drt. in view of the aforesaid analysis we concur with the view expressed by the division bench and hold that the official liquidator can prefer an appeal before drt. as he was prosecuting the lis in all genuineness before the company court and defending the order before the division bench we grant him weeks ' time to file an appeal after following the due procedure. on such an appeal being preferred drt shall deal with the appeal in accordance with law. drt is directed to decide the appeal within $$$$ months after offering an opportunity of hearing to all concerned. till the appeal is disposed of the interim order passed by this court shall remain in force. we has to clarify that we have not expressed anything on the merits of the case.emphasis. reliance was then placed on $$$ xxi rule of the $$$ of civil procedure which is extracted hereunder:. attachment of immovable property.where the property is immovable the attachment shall be made by an $$$ prohibiting the judgment debtor from transferring or charging the property in any way and all persons from taking any benefit from such transfer or charge.the order shall also require the judgment debtor to atd court on a specified date to take notice of the date to be fixed for settling the terms of the proclamation of sale.the order shall be proclaimed at some place on or adjacent to such property by beat of drum or other customary mode and a copy of the order shall be affixed on a conspicuous part of the property and then upon a conspicuous part of the court house and also where the property is land paying revenue to the government in the office of $$$ in which the land is situate and where the property is land situate in village also in the office of the gram panchayat if any having jurisdiction over that village.to support the contion advanced at the hands of learned senior counsel representing the respondents reliance was placed on $$$ v. $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc. the following observations recorded therein are of relevance:0. the nature and effect of an alienation made in violation of an order of injunction was considered in tayabbhai m. bagasarwalla v. hind rubber industries p ltd. and the following propositions were laid down:. according to this section if an objection is raised to the jurisdiction of the court at the hearing of an application for grant of or for vacating interim relief the court should determine that issue in the instance as a preliminary issue before granting or setting aside the relief already granted. an application raising objection to the jurisdiction to the court is directed to be heard with all expedition. $$$ -rule however says that the command in $$$ -rule does not preclude the court from granting such interim relief as it may consider necessary pending the decision on the question of jurisdiction. in our opinion the provision merely states the obvious. it makes explicit what is implicit in law. just because an objection to the jurisdiction is raised the court does not become helpless forthwith -nor does it become incompet to grant the interim relief. it can. at the same time it should also decide the objection to jurisdiction at the earliest possible moment. this is the general principle and this is what section reiterates. take this very case. the plaintiff asked for temporary injunction. an ad interim injunction was granted. then the defendants came forward objecting to the grant of injunction and also raising an objection to the jurisdiction of the court. the court overruled the objection as to jurisdiction and made the interim injunction absolute. the defendants filed an appeal against the decision on the question of jurisdiction. while that appeal was pending several other interim orders were passed both by the civil court as well as by the high court. ultimately no doubt the high court has found that the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit but all this took about years. can it be said that orders passed by the civil court and the high court during this period of years were all non est and that it is open to the defendants to flout them merrily without fear of any consequence. admittedly this could not be d until the high court 's decision on the question of jurisdiction. the question is whether the said decision of the high court means that no person can be punished for flouting or disobeying the interim / interlocutory orders while they were in force i. for violations and disobedience committed prior to the decision of the high court on the question of jurisdiction. holding that by virtue of the said decision of the high court on the question of jurisdiction. no can be punished thereafter for disobedience or violation of the interim orders committed prior to the said decision of the high court would indeed be subversive of the rule of law and would seriously erode the dignity and the authority of the courts. we must repeat that this is not even a case where a suit was filed in the wrong court knowingly or only with a view to snatch an interim order. as pointed out hereinabove the suit was filed in the civil court bona fide. we are of the opinion that in such a case the defendants can not escape the consequences of their disobedience and violation of the interim injunction committed by them prior to the high court 's decision on the question of jurisdiction. the correct principle therefore is the recognised and reiterated in section -to wit where an objection to jurisdiction of a civil court is raised to entertain a suit and to pass any interim orders therein the court should decide the question of jurisdiction in the instance but that does not mean that pending the decision on the question of jurisdiction the court has no jurisdiction to pass interim orders as may be called for in the facts and circumstances of the case. a mere objection to jurisdiction does not instantly disable the court from passing any interim orders. it can yet pass appropriate orders. at the same time it should also decide the question of jurisdiction at the earliest possible time. the interim orders so passed are orders within jurisdiction when passed and effective till the court decides that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. these interim orders undoubtedly come to an end with the decision that this court had no jurisdiction. it is open to the court to modify these orders while holding that it has no jurisdiction to try the suit...emphasis supplied). it was the emphatic contion of learned counsel for the respondents that the sole purpose for requiring the official liquidator to participate in the proceedings before the drt was to keep the interest of the creditors before the company court where winding up proceedings had been initiated by other creditors secure. the interest of the creditors before the company court could be secure only if the sale of the properties of the company under winding up was made by conforming to the crystalised practices in getting the best price. referring to the conclusions drawn in the impugned order it was submitted that the auction sale conducted by the recovery officer was farcical as it was with the sole object of exding benefits to the $$$ -anita international. it was therefore asserted that the division bench of the high court was fully justified in setting aside the order passed by the learned single judge. mr. p. chidambaram learned senior counsel in rejoinder and in response to the contions advanced at the hands of the respondents invited this court 's attion to sections and of the rdb act. the same are extracted hereunder:. bar of jurisdiction.and from

company court nor any other court could have exercised jurisdiction vested in the rdb act. it was submitted that the official liquidator has no participatory role under the rdb act. the official liquidator has jurisdictional control over the assets of a company under winding up under the companies act. in this behalf learned senior counsel for the $$$ placed reliance on $$$ v. chaman paswan $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ scr and pointed out to the following observations recorded. the answer to these contions must depend on what the position in law is when a court entertains a suit or an appeal over which it has no jurisdiction and what the effect of section of the suits valuation act is on that position. it is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. a defect of jurisdiction whether it is pecuniary or territorial or whether it is in respect of the subject -matter of the action strikes at the very authority of the court to pass any decree and such a defect can not be cured even by consent of parties. if the question now under consideration fell to be determined only on the application of general principles governing the matter there can be no doubt that the district court of monghyr was coram non judice and that its judgment and decree would be nullities. the question is what is the effect of section of the suits valuation act on this position.emphasis supplied)reliance was also placed on dhurandhar prasad singh v. jai prakash university $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc and the court 's attion was drawn to the following observations:0. $$$ woolf and $$$ in their treatise judicial review of administrative action edn.para -have summarised the concept of void and voidable as follows behind the simple dichotomy of void and voidable acts invalid and valid until declared to be invalid lurk terminological and conceptual problems of excruciating complexity. the problems arose from the premise that if an act order or decision is ultra vires in the sense of outside jurisdiction it was said to be invalid or null and void. if it is intra vires it was of course valid. if it is flawed by an error perpetrated within the area of authority or jurisdiction it was usually said to be voidable that is valid till set aside on appeal or in the past quashed by certiorari for error of law on the face of the record. clive lewis in his work judicial remedies in public law at p. has explained the expressions void and voidable as follows a challenge to the validity of an act may be by direct action or by way of collateral or indirect challenge. a direct action is where the principal purpose of the action is to establish the invalidity. this will usually be by way of an application for judicial review or by use of any statutory mechanism for appeal or review. collateral challenges arise when the invalidity is raised in the course of some other proceedings the purpose of which is not to establish invalidity but where questions of validity become relevant.thereupon reference was made to jagmittar sain bhagat v. director health services $$$ / $$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc. in order to canvass the proposition that jurisdiction of courts / forums can not be conferred by consent of parties or acquiescence or waiver. reliance in this behalf was placed on the following conclusions drawn by this court:. indisputably it is a settled legal proposition that conferment of jurisdiction is a legislative function and it can neither be conferred with the consent of the parties nor by a superior court and if the court passes a decree having no jurisdiction over the matter it would amount to nullity as the matter goes to the root of the cause. such an issue can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. the finding of a court or tribunal becomes irrelevant and unenforceable / inexecutable once the forum is found to have no jurisdiction. similarly if a court / tribunal inherently lacks jurisdiction acquiescence of party equally should not be permitted to perpetrate and perpetuate defeating of the legislative animation. the court can not derive jurisdiction apart from the statute. in such eventuality the doctrine of waiver also does not apply. vide united commercial bank ltd. v. workmen $$$ / sc/006/$$$ / sc/006/ air sc $$$ v. lala ramnarayan $$$ / sc/06/$$$ / sc/06/ air sc natraj studios p ltd. v.

$$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ air sc held that a decree without jurisdiction is a nullity. it is a coram non judice when a special statute gives a right and also provides for a forum for adjudication of rights remedy has to be sought only under the provisions of that act and the common law court has no jurisdiction where an act creates an obligation and enforces the performance in specified manner performance can not be forced in any other manner. the law does not permit any court / tribunal / authority / forum to usurp jurisdiction on any ground whatsoever in case such an authority does not have jurisdiction on the subject -matter. for the reason that it is not an objection as to the place of suing it is an objection going to the nullity of the order on the ground of want of jurisdiction. thus for assumption of jurisdiction by a court or a tribunal exisce of jurisdictional fact is a condition precedent. but once such jurisdictional fact is found to exist the court or tribunal has power to decide on the adjudicatory facts or facts in issue. vide setrucherla ramabhadraraju v. maharaja of jeypore $$$ / pr/00/$$$ / pr/00/ air pc state of gujarat v. rajesh kumar

supplementing the above contions mr. s. $$$ learned senior counsel pointed out that in the present controversy the state bank of mysore had preferred an application before the company court under section of the companies act. it was asserted that the order passed by the high court was an order in personam and as such the aforesaid order dated.could not be considered as binding on the drt or for that matter on the recovery officer of the drt. for the above proposition learned senior counsel placed reliance on the andhra bank case $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc and drew the attion of this court to the following conclusions recorded therein:. section of the companies act indisputably confers a wide power upon the company judge but such a power can be exercised only upon consideration of the respective contions of the parties raised in a suit or a proceeding or any claim made by or against the company. a question of determining the priorities would also fall for consideration if the parties claiming the same are before the court. section of the companies act ipso facto confers no power upon the court to pass interlocutory orders. the question as to whether the courts have inherent power to pass such orders in our opinion does not arise for consideration in this proceeding. assuming such a power exists it was imperative that the same should have been exercised on consideration of the factors laid down by this court in morgan stanley mutual fund v. kartick $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc. an unreasd order does not subserve the doctrine of fair play. see mangalore ganesh $$$ v. cit $$$ / $$$ / sc/006/$$$$ scc.emphasis supplied). in order to make the final thrust learned senior counsel representing the $$$ submitted that an auction sale of the nature which is subject matter of consideration in the present controversy was not liable to be set aside merely on account of some trivial infirmities in the procedure adopted for the sale of the same. it was the submission of learned counsel that only a material irregularity would persuade a court to interfere with such sale proceedings conducted in furtherance of statutory power conferred upon such authority. to support the above contion reliance was placed by learned senior counsel ly on the following observations in the decision rendered by this court in radhy shyam v. shyam behari $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ air sc. there can be no doubt that an application under order xxi rule to set aside an auction -sale concerns the rights of a person declared to be the purchaser. if the application is allowed the sale is set aside and the purchaser is deprived of his right to have the sale confirmed by the court under rule. such a right is a valuable right in that upon such confirmation the sale becomes absolute and the rights of ownership in the property so sold become vested in him. a decision in such a proceeding therefore must be said to be determining the right of the auction -purchaser to have the sale confirmed and made absolute and of the judgment -debtor conferred by rule to have it set aside and a resale ordered. in our view an order in a proceeding under order xxi rule is a judgment inasmuch as such a proceeding raises a controversy between the parties therein affecting their valuable rights and the order allowing the application certainly deprives the purchaser of rights accrued to him as a result of the auction -sale. we therefore agree with the high court that a letters pat appeal lay against the order of the learned single judge. rule of order xxi of the $$$ as amended by the allahabad high court inter alia provides that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity or even fraud unless upon the facts proved the court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained injury by reason of such irregularity or fraud. mere proof of a material irregularity such as the under rule and inadequacy of price realised in such a sale in other words injury is therefore not sufficient. what has to be established is that there was not only inadequacy of the price but that that inadequacy was caused by reason of the material irregularity or fraud. a connection has thus to be established between the inadequacy of the price and the material irregularity.emphasis supplied)additionally reliance was placed on navalkha and sons v. sri ramanya $$$ / $$$ / sc/06/$$$$ scc. and the court 's attion was drawn to the following observations:. in the present case the division bench has come to the conclusion that publicity was not as wide as originally proposed by the commissirs in their affidavit. the publication was made in dailies namely the hindu indian express the hindustan times and the statesman. there was no publication in the times of india. further out of the newspapers in which publication was made only in there were insertions and in the remaining there was only insertion. this was contrary to what the commissirs have promised in their affidavit dated july. no doubt other efforts were made for giving publicity but these efforts were not sufficient to attract more than offer. when the case came for confirmation on december there was an application by $$$ that the property was of much higher value and that fresh offers must be invited again with wider publicity. there is also the affidavit of the state government dated august in which the value of the property was shown as rs. besides on $$$$ $$$ had come before the court with a higher offer showing his bona fides and earnestness by depositing more than lakh of rupees. he came with the complaint that there was not sufficient publicity as to attract people from the north and that as soon as he came to know he gave his offer. in these circumstances the learned single judge was right in expressing his reluctance to confirm the offer of navalkha & sons. he therefore decided to have an open bid as between the $$$ and $$$ in the court itself on $$$$. the complaint of $$$ is that the step taken by the single judge of holding an auction without giving wide publicity was not justified in law. rule of the companies court rules provides that all sales shall be made by public auction or by inviting sealed ders or in such manner as the judge may direct. it appears that on april at the instance of the official liquidator and at the instance of a contributory the court had approved of the terms and conditions of sale which provide calling of sealed ders. on december the learned judge realised the inefficacy of this course and decided to abandon the original procedure and put the properties to auction. but having made up his mind to resort to auction the learned judge confined the auction to only persons namely the previous derer and the fresh derer. the auction in question no doubt was conducted in a public place but it was not a public auction because it was not open to the general public but was confined to named persons.  it was not held after due publicity. it was held immediately after it was decided upon. it is therefore obvious that the sale in question was not a public sale which implies sale after giving notice to the public wherein every member of the public is at liberty to participate. no doubt the device resorted to considerably raised the previous bid yet it was not an adequate price having regard to the market value of the property to which reference has already been made. the denial of opportunity to purchase the property by persons who would have taken part in the auction bid but for want of notice is a serious matter. in our opinion the learned judge having decided on december that the property should be put to auction should have directed auction by public sale instead of confining it to persons al. since there was want of publicity and there was lack of opportunity to the public to take part in the auction the acceptance of the highest bid by the learned judge was not a sound exercise of discretion. it is conded on behalf of the $$$ that confirmation was discretionary with the court and the division bench ought not to have interfered with the discretion exercised by the company judge. it is true that the discretion exercised by the judge ought not to be interfered with unless the judge has g wrong on principle. as already pointed out the learned company judge having decided to put the property to auction went wrong in not holding the auction as a public auction after due publicity and this has resulted in prejudice to the company and the creditors in that the auction did not fetch adequate price. the prejudice was inherent in the method adopted. the petition of $$$ also suggests that want of publicity had resulted in prejudice. in these circumstances the company judge ought not to have confirmed the bid of the $$$ in the auction held on december. we are accordingly of opinion that the division bench was right in holding that the order of the company judge dated february should be set aside and there should be fresh sale of the property either by calling sealed ders or by auction in accordance with law. the der will be called or the auction will take place with the minimum offer or with the starting bid of lakh rupees.emphasis supplied)0. based on the legal position declared by this court in the above judgments it was asserted that the validity of the auction sale held on.and the confirmation thereof on.was natural and normal in the facts and circumstances of this case. in order to restore the aforestated validity it was submitted that the impugned order passed by the high court deserved to be set aside. we have given our thoughtful consideration to the complicated sequence of facts projected before us as also the legal submissions advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the rival parties. we shall now endeavour to record our conclusions with reference to the issues canvassed. in our considered view the controversy projected for our consideration falls in a narrow compass. it is apposite to crystalise the dimensions of the dispute. deve sugars ltd. was ordered to be wound up on.in company petition no. of. the official liquidator took possession of the assets of deve sugars ltd. situated at harige on.. the state bank of mysore filed company application nos. -of in the then pending company petition no. of. through the above applications the state bank of mysore sought leave of the company court in the high court at madras to pursue the recovery proceedings before the drt bangalore. on.the company court granted leave..subject to the condition that.. no coercive steps are taken against the assets of the company during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the tribunal.. after the drt bangalore issued the recovery certificate dated.the state bank of mysore filed company application no. of with a prayer that the bank be permitted to seek execution of the recovery certificate. it is not a matter of dispute that the company court in the high court at madras neither heard nor passed any order on the above application. the admitted position is that the registry of the high court at its own returned the above company application no. of by recording an endorsement that leave of the high court was not necessary. the recovery officer thereafter proceeded with the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. tungabadra sugar works mazdoor sangha the workers ' union of deve sugars ltd.objected to the execution of the recovery certificate by the recovery officer. the official liquidator who was ordered to be impleaded in the recovery proceedings initiated by the state bank of mysore vide order dated.passed by the company court in the high court at madras also filed objections. all the above objections were overruled by the recovery officer. the workers ' union then assailed the recovery proceedings before the high court of karnataka by filing $$$ no. of. videocon international ltd. and $$$. ltd. also filed $$$ no. of before the high court of karnataka. in the above writ petitions the petitirs assailed the sale proceedings before the recovery officer. based on a preliminary objection raised by the $$$ -anita international the high court of karnataka relegated the petitirs to their remedy under the rdb act by a common order dated.. the above order was challenged through writ appeal nos. and of before the high court of karnataka. the writ appeals were dismissed on.. the workers ' union thereafter preferred aor no. of and videocon international ltd. filed aor no. of. in both the above matters a challenge was raised to the order passed by the recovery officer dated.whereby the sale of properties of deve sugars ltd. to anita international was confirmed. it would be relevant to mention that as against the reserve price of rs. crores anita international -the $$$ herein made a bid of rs.crores. the same was accepted by the recovery officer on.and confirmed on.. n. ponnusamy filed company application nos. -of before the company court in the high court at madras wherein he assailed the sale and confirmation orders dated.and.. in the above applications it was inter alia asserted that the reserve price of rs. crores was too low. the above company applications were dismissed on.. a challenge raised against the same was also dismissed by the high court at madras. the applications filed by the official liquidator and ors. were considered collectively with company application nos. -of and were rejected by a common order dated.whereby all the applicants were relegated to their remedy of appeal under the rdb act. a challenge raised to the above order dated.by way of an intra -court appeal was allowed by the high court on.. it is this order which is subject matter of challenge before this court. stated concisely the high court expressed the view that the proceedings before the recovery officer including the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. on.and the confirmation thereof on.had been conducted in disregard of the order of the company court in the high court at madras dated.in company application nos. -of. the sale and confirmation of the properties of deve sugars ltd. in favour of anita international were accordingly set aside. the principal debate raised before this court revolves around the cause and effect of the order dated.passed by the company court in the high court at madras. according to learned counsel for the $$$s the above order dated.being wholly void and non est could not have any bearing on the proceedings conducted by the recovery officer including the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. on.and also the confirmation thereof by the recovery officer on.. according to the respondents who support the impugned order dated.the order dated.was valid and had a binding effect. and because the proceedings conducted by the recovery officer were in total disregard of the order dated.it was submitted that the impugned order was well founded. in order to support their claim it was submitted on behalf of the $$$s that jurisdiction in matters of recovery agitated by banks and financial institutions under the rdb act has been repeatedly expounded by this court. the concerned debts recovery tribunals before whom recovery proceedings are initiated have exclusive jurisdiction in the matter. it was also pointed out that this court has clearly declared that even the jurisdiction of recovery officers in matters of execution of recovery certificates was likewise exclusive. it was the pointed contention of learned counsel for the $$$s that in matters wherein banks and financial institutions approach a debts recovery tribunal which on due consideration issues a recovery certificate the same can be executed only through a recovery officer. it was submitted that a company court has no jurisdiction in the matter. $$$ for the $$$s substantiated the above assertion on the basis of the decisions rendered by this court in the allahabad bank $$$ / sc/0262/$$$$$$$ / sc/0262/$$$$ scc the m.v. $$$ $$$ / sc/60/$$$$$$$ / sc/60/$$$$ scc the andhra bank $$$ / sc/020/$$$$$$$ / sc/020/$$$$ scc the rajasthan state financial corporation $$$ / sc//$$$$$$$ / sc//$$$$ scc and the official liquidator uttar pradesh and uttarakhand $$$ / sc/02/$$$$$$$ / sc/02/$$$$ scc cases. according to learned counsel for the $$$s it was apparent that the action of a recovery officer in conducting sale proceedings and ordering the confirmation thereof for executing a recovery certificate fell squarely within his jurisdiction under the rdb act. and his jurisdiction being exclusive as declared by this court could not be interfered with or set aside. it is in the above context that it was also the pointed assertion of learned counsel representing the $$$ that the order passed by the company court in the high court at madras dated.was without jurisdiction. $$$ representing the $$$ however cautid this court not to confuse the power of the recovery officer in executing recovery certificates through sale of the debtor 's properties with the apportionment of the sale proceeds. it was urged that the concern of the $$$ -anita international was limited to the sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd.which it had purchased on.which was confirmed by the recovery officer on.. it was submitted that the $$$ -anita international has no concern with the distribution of the sale proceeds and as such the issue of distribution of the sale proceeds should not fall within the consideration of the present determination. it is not possible for us to accept the contentions advanced on behalf of the $$$s. in this behalf it would be relevant to mention that in the m.v. $$$ case $$$ / sc/60/$$$$$$$ / sc/60/$$$$ scc the company court by an order dated.required that its permission should be obtained before the recovery officer finalized the sale. $$$ the company court by an order dated.directed that sale by the recovery officer was subject to confirmation by the company court. in the above sequence of facts this court clearly held that the condition imposed by the company court could not be violated by the recovery officer. it was concluded that the sale made by the recovery officer in violation of the orders passed by the company court was without the authority of law the same was accordingly set aside. the explanation tendered by learned senior counsel representing the $$$s was that even in the above judgment this court had not disturbed the exclusive jurisdiction of a recovery officer in executing the recovery certificate. in our considered view the above contention is immaterial to the issue under consideration. the issue under consideration is whether or not an order passed by the company court in the present case the order dated.was binding on the recovery officer and whether the proceedings conducted by the recovery officer in violation of the above order were sustainable in law we have no hesitation in concluding that in the m.v. $$$ case $$$ / sc/60/$$$$$$$ / sc/60/$$$$ scc an order passed by the company court was held to be binding on the recovery officer. based on exactly the same consideration we are of the view that the acceptance of the bid of anita international by the recovery officer on.and the confirmation of the sale in its favour on.were clearly impermissible and therefore deserve to be set aside. in addition to the above reference may be made to the judgment rendered by this court in the official liquidator uttar pradesh and uttarakhand case $$$ / sc/02/$$$$$$$ / sc/02/$$$$ scc. in paragraph of the above judgment extracted in paragraph xxx xxx hereinabove this court has taken due notice of the proposition with reference to a case where an order had been passed by the company court. the proposition dealt with was in a situation where the company court had imposed a condition on the recovery officer that permission of the company court would be obtained before the recovery officer conducted the sale and confirmation of the movable or immovable properties of the debtor. it was held that the order passed by the company court was binding on the recovery officer. in the above judgment it was concluded that it was not open to the recovery officer to confirm the sale of the properties at his own and such a sale and confirmation of movable or immovable properties made by the recovery officer without the permission of the company court were liable to be set aside. this court while recording its above conclusion also expressed that the above issue had nothing to do with the proposition whether an official liquidator can approach a company court to seek the setting aside of the auction and the sale conduced by the recovery officer. it would be relevant to mention that the judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the $$$s were duly taken into consideration in the official liquidator uttar pradesh and uttarakhand case $$$ / sc/02/$$$$$$$ / sc/02/$$$$ scc. in view of the above we are of the considered view that the pointed issue canvassed before us at the hands of learned counsel for the $$$s stands answered against the $$$ in paragraph of the above judgment. we endorse and are obliged to follow the view expressed by this court as noticed above. accordingly we find no merit in the contention advanced at the hands of learned counsel for the $$$s. despite our above conclusion it is imperative for us to notice that for recovery of a debt due to a bank or a financial institution the concerned bank or financial institution can legitimately initiate proceedings by filing a winding up petition before the jurisdictional company court or alternatively intervene in a pending winding up petition. since there is no bar restraining a bank or a financial institution from approaching a company court by filing a winding up petition it is not possible to conclude that the jurisdictional company court is not possessed with the determinative authority / competence to entertain a claim raised by such bank or financial institution. in view of the above it is not possible for us to accept as was suggested on behalf of the $$$s that the order passed by the company court in the high court at madras dated.lacked the jurisdictional authority. since we have concluded that the company court which passed the order dated.did not lack jurisdiction we hereby hold that in the facts of this case the above order dated.was neither invalid nor void. we are also of the considered view as held by the court in the krishnadevi $$$ case $$$ / sc/00/$$$$$$$ / sc/00/$$$$ scc that it is not open either to parties to a lis or to any parties to determine at their own that an order passed by a court is valid or void. a party to the lis or a party who considers an order passed by a court as void or non est must approach a court of competent jurisdiction to have the said order set aside on such grounds as may be available in law. however till an order passed by a competent court is set aside as was also held by this court in the official liquidator uttar pradesh and uttarakhand $$$ / sc/02/$$$$$$$ / sc/02/$$$$ scc and the $$$ $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc cases the same would have the force of law and any act / action carried out in violation thereof would be liable to be set aside. we endorse the opinion expressed by this court in the $$$ case manu / sc/04/$$$$manu / sc/04/$$$$ scc. in the above case an earlier order of a court was found to be without jurisdiction after years. in other words an order passed by a court having no jurisdiction had subsisted for years. this court held that the said order could not have been violated while it subsisted. and further that the violation of the order before it is set aside is liable to entail punishment for its disobedience. for us to conclude otherwise may have disastrous consequences. in the above situation every cantankerous and quarrelsome litigant would be entitled to canvass that in his wisdom the judicial order detrimental to his interests was void voidable or patently errous. and based on such plea to avoid or disregard or even disobey the same. this course can never be permitted. to be fair to learned counsel for the $$$s it needs to be noticed that reliance was also placed on behalf of the $$$s on the $$$ / sc/06/4manu / sc/06/4 scr the sadashiv prasad $$$ / sc/00/204manu / sc/00/204 scc and the jagmittar $$$ / sc/070/20manu / sc/070/20 scc cases to contend that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction was a nullity and that its invalidity could not be corrected even by the consent of the concerned parties. we are of the considered view that the proposition debated and concluded in the judgments relied upon by learned counsel for the $$$s referred to above are of no relevance to the conclusions drawn in the foregoing paragraph. in our determination hereinabove we have not held that a void order can be legitimized. what we have concluded in the foregoing paragraph is that while an order passed by a court subsists the same is liable to be complied with till it is set aside. the submission canvassed at the hands of learned counsel for the $$$s that the impugned sale dated.and its confirmation on.should not be interfered with on the ground of equity as the $$$ had made the entire payment in and the recovery officer had ordered confirmation of the sale as no objection had been raised against the same. we find it difficult to persuade ourselves to accept the above contention. in this behalf can not lose sight of the fact that the official liquidator as well as the workers ' union had raised objections before the recovery officer at the very initial stage. even a former director of deve sugars ltd. ponnusamy raised a challenge to the proceedings before the recovery officer by asserting that the reserve price of rs. crores fixed for the property being put to auction was too low. the fact that in the process of sale of the properties of deve sugars ltd. only bids were received has not been disputed. it is also not disputed that whilst of the bidders was the appellant -anita international the other bidder was synergy steel ltd.sister company of the appellant. in sum and substance therefore there was only bidder. for the above reasons in addition to those recorded by the high court noticed in paragraph xxx xxx hereinabove it is not possible for us to accept the claim of the appellant on the ground of equity. reliance placed by learned counsel on the judgments rendered by this court in support of the instant contention is also unacceptable as the factual position in the judgments relied upon are inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. in view of the above we find no merit in the contention advanced. it was also submitted on behalf of the appellants that the sale conducted by the recovery officer on.and the order of confirmation thereof passed by the recovery officer on.ought to have been assailed only in proceedings under section of the rdb act. it was submitted that since an efficacious alternative remedy was available to the parties which had approached the company court in the high court at madras the interference at the hands of the high court was neither just nor proper. the instant submission is wholly devoid of substance and deserves to be rejected. we are of the considered view that there was sufficient justification for the parties to have approached the company court in the high court at madras for the reason that they were seeking the enforcement of the order dated.passed by the company court itself. the sale made by the recovery officer on.and its confirmation on.were in utter violation of the order dated.and therefore the concerned parties were justified in approaching the high court at madras. in the above view of the matter we find no merit in the instant contention as well. last of all we may advert to the contention that the order dated.passed by the company court in the high court at madras while disposing of company application nos. -of filed by the state bank of mysore was not binding on the appellant. insofar as the instant contention is concerned it was submitted that the said order passed by the high court was an order in personam and as such the aforesaid order could not be considered as an order binding on the appellant before this court. we find no merit in the instant contention as well. in this behalf it would be relevant to mention that in the application filed by the state bank of mysore the prayer made was that the state bank of mysore be permitted leave to proceed with recovery proceedings before the drt bangalore. by the order dated.the company court in the high court at madras while granting leave imposed conditions. firstly the official liquidator would have to be impleaded by the bank in the recovery proceedings before the drt bangalore. and no coercive steps would be taken against the assets of the company during or after the conclusion of the proceedings before the tribunal. it is not possible for us to accept that the aforesaid order passed by the high court was an order in personam. we are of the view that the above order had a clear and binding effect on the proceedings permitted to be initiated before the drt bangalore and further that it was equally binding on the recovery officer. and accordingly in our view the same would also be binding on those claiming through sale proceedings conducted by the recovery officer. in the above view of the matter there can be no doubt that the order dated.was also binding on the appellant before this court. for the above reasons we find no merit even in the last contention advanced by learned counsel for the appellants. for all the reasons recorded hereinabove we find no merit in the instant appeals. the same are accordingly dismissed. while affirming the impugned order passed by the high court we confirm the setting aside of the sale made by the recovery officer in favour of the appellant -anita international on.and the confirmation thereof by the order of the recovery officer dated..
