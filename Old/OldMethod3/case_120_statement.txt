s.b. sinha j. criteria for determining inter se seniority amongst the officers of haryana judicial service whether on the basis of merit in terms of the merit list or the date of joining is the core question involved in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated.passed by the punjab & haryana high court in c.w.p. no. of filed by the appellant herein. the basic fact of the matter is not in dispute. haryana public service commission respondent no. herein issued an advertisement notifying vacancies of haryana civil services judicial branch on or about.. the break up of the said posts is as 	 vacancies for general category 	 	 vacancies reserved for scheduled castes 	 vacancies which remained unfilled on account of non -availability of candidates belonging to sc category in the competitive exam. $$$ in -advertised time.	 vacancies reserved for esm 	 	 vacancies reserved for $$$es. a competitive examination was held in december. by a $$$ dated.the respondent herein sent requisition for anticipated vacancies upto.the break up of which is as under:. by order dated th july the commission recommended names for vacancies the break up of which is as under:. the result of the said examination for recruitment of the hsc judicial branch was published in the haryana gazette on or about.from a perusal whereof it would appear that the appellant herein was placed at serial no. whereas the respondent nos. to were placed at serial nos. and respectively. it is not in dispute that on or about.it was notified that existing and notified vacancies would be increased by as a result whereof a further reservation being for scheduled castes candidates and for $$$ candidate and for general candidates was made the break up thereof is:. the break up of all the vacancies was as $$$. in the result published by the haryana public service commission candidates were declared qualified in terms of the provisions of the rules relating to the appointment of subordinate judges in the haryana civil service judicial branch hereinafter referred to as the rules. out of the successful candidates persons namely mr. baljeet singh mr. $$$ and mr. $$$ whose names figured at serial nos. and belonged to the $$$. persons including the appellant herein namely mr. $$$ mrs. $$$ mr. $$$ mr. $$$ and mr. $$$ duggal who were at serial nos. and of the select list respectively belonged to scheduled castes and persons namely mr. man $$$ and mr. $$$ were selected from the category of $$$ -servicemen. posts were therefore available for posts reserved for different categories. according to the high court vacancies reserved for the members of scheduled castes and for $$$ -servicemen could be filled up from amongst the candidates belonging to the general category raising the number of posts available therefore to. however despite the fact that posts were available for members of the general category for reasons best known to the state only persons belonging to the general category were appointed by an order dated.. $$$. and thereafter with other candidates who despite the fact that their names appeared in the merit list but were not appointed filed a writ petition in the high court conding inter alia therein that their names should have been entered in the register maintained therefore as envisaged by rule of part -d of the rules and to fill up the existing vacancies and also the vacancies which are anticipated to raise during the period of years from the date of publication of the result of the examination i.up to december. the said writ petition was allowed by order dated.holding:"in terms of the law laid down by the supreme court in $$$ 's case $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ we direct the state of haryana to forward the list of candidates who qualified in the examination general and reserved held in december and the high court would forthwith enter the names of such number of candidates as would be necessary in terms of rule of part -d of the rules in the register in order of merit. the names of the candidates of the reserved categories would also be brought on the register in the same manner. the high court would then consider to fill up the remaining vacancies and would forward the names of the requisite number of candidates to the state government for appointment as per rule ( of part d of the rules as subordinate judges under article of the constitution. while doing so it will be open to the high court in the interests of higher standard not to recommend the names of all the candidates who obtained per cent marks and the appointment can be restricted to such number of candidates who obtained higher percentage than per cent as may be decided by the high court and agreed to by the government. it is not in dispute that this court in $$$ v. state of haryana and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ directed that she be assigned seniority with the $$$. the high court 's direction was made in the light of the observations of this court in $$$. the high court on its administrative side thereafter by a letter dated.requested the state to comply with the order passed by it on its judicial side and issue order for appointment in respect of ms. $$$ s / shri a.s. narang and kamal kant whose names as noticed hereinbefore figured at serial nos. and of the merit list. the appointment letters of mr. a.s. narang and kamal kant were issued on.whereas the appointment letter of ms. $$$ was issued on.. as in the meantime more candidates namely ms. $$$ serial no. and mr. $$$ serial no. expressed their unwillingness to join the said post the state government was requested for the appointment of ms. $$$ serial no. a similar request was made by letter dated.for appointment of mrs. manisha chopra now $$$ and s / shri satish$$$ garg and $$$ whose names appeared at serial nos. and of merit list but the state refused to accede to the said recommendations. $$$ the said candidates filed writ petitions before the high court which was marked as cwp nos. and. the writ petitions of mr. $$$ and ms. manisha chopra was allowed whereas the writ petition of mr. $$$ was disposed of with a direction to the high court to recommend his name under the rules with a further direction that thereafter the state government would appoint him forthwith. however other writ petitions were dismissed. on an appeal preferred against the said judgment by $$$$ respondent herein in relation to the writ petition filed by ms. manisha chopra although special leave was granted by this court but ultimately having regard to the undisputed factual position that there has been an existing vacancy the said appeal was dismissed. however the appeal in relation to mr. $$$ and mr. $$$ being civil appeal nos. and of were allowed. pursuant to and in furtherance of the order of this court an offer of appointment was issued in favour of ms. manisha batra on.. representations were made by the judicial officers for determination of their inter se seniority in the aforementid premise and the matter was considered by a sub -committee appointed by the high court. the sub -committee upon giving opportunities of hearing to all parties and or their lawyers opined that having regard to the consist practice followed by the high court that seniority be determined as per merit the same rule should be made applicable and thus negatived the contion raised on behalf of the appellant and persons similarly situated that inter se seniority be determined on the basis of the respective dates of appointments of the candidates. while arriving at the said decision the sub -committee found that the cases of the concerned candidate is similar to that of $$$. the said recommendations of the sub -committee were accepted by the full court of the high court by adopting a resolution in that behalf on or about.. $$$ thereby a writ petition was filed by the appellant herein which by reason of the impugned judgment was dismissed. before the high court only contions were raised on behalf of the appellant namely that the vacancies which remained unfilled because of non -availability of the candidates from the reserved category i.. schedule castes category could not have been diverted to general category candidates as the same could not have been dereserved and factually these very vacancies of the year which remained unfilled from the scheduled castes category were actually advertised in the year and therefore there were no posts vacant for the private respondents who have been given appointments in the batch of year because of non -exisce of posts in the general category and that even though the petitir who belongs to scheduled castes category may have been below the general category candidate in the merit list yet the seniority is to be determined as per the roster points and not according to merit. both the said contions did not find favour with the high court. dr. $$$ learned counsel appearing for the appellant has raised a number of contions in support of this appeal. the learned counsel conds that as posts were advertised for general categories appointment of persons there against was illegal. reliance in this behalf has been placed on $$$ and ors. v. chairman banking service recruitment board and ors. $$$ / sc/05/$$$ / sc/05/. the learned counsel conded that the appellant herein would not question the legality or validity of the appointments of respondents nos. to but submitted that no candidate from the waiting list appointed subsequently could be appointed from a back date. a person appointed pursuant to the order of the high court urged dr. $$$ shall be deemed to be in service from the date he joins and not prior thereto. it was conded that having regard to the fact that vacancies in the reserved categories had to be filled up in accordance with the roster points no general category candidate would have been appointed against such vacancies having regard to the decision of the apex court in r.k. sabharwal and ors. v. state of punjab and ors. $$$ / sc/05/5$$$ / sc/05/5. the learned counsel would urge that the vacancies must be filled up as per roster points and this principle of law has been reiterated by a constitution bench if this in all india judges ' association and ors. v. union of india and ors.. dr. $$$ urged that having regard to the amendment in the constitution inserting article the decision of this court in ajit singh and ors. ii v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/0575/$$$ / sc/0575/ airsc7 must be held to have lost its efficacy. our attion has also been drawn to the opinion of the commission that inter se seniority of the officers be determined on the basis of respective dates of appointment. mr. p.p. rao learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of $$$. to on the other hand submitted that having regard to the practice prevalent in the punjab & haryana high court inter se seniority has rightly been determined on the basis of result of the examination conducted by the public service commission. the learned counsel would urge that as this court in $$$ supra while considering the question of appointment of a candidate under the said rules directed that she be placed in the seniority list of $$$ there is no reason as to why this court would deviate from the said principle. mr. rao would urge that it is not within the province of the commission to make recommendations as regards the inter se seniority of the candidates in as much as its function is merely to make recommendations for appointment of the candidates upon preparing a select list therefore. it was submitted that having regard to the instructions issued by the haryana government in its $$$ letter dated.roster points can not be considered a s seniority points and further having regard to the fact that these instructions have been followed by the high court for a long time there is absolutely no reason as to why such a practice should be deviated from. the learned counsel conded that this court in ajit singh-(ii supra having categorically held that roster points are not inded to determine seniority between general candidates and reserved candidates the impugned judgment can not be faulted with. it is not in dispute that the rules are in force since.. part -a of the rules lays down the qualifications for appointments. part -b of the rules provides that the advertisement to be issued for the post by haryana public service commission as also the mode and manner in which the applications are required to be submitted by the candidates. part -c of the said rules relates to the examination of the candidates. rules provides that no candidate shall be called for the viva -voce test unless he obtains at least per cent marks in the aggregate in all the writ papers and per cent marks in the language paper of $$$ in $$$. rule of the rules is as under:"no candidate shall be considered to have qualified in the examination unless he obtains atleast per cent marks in the aggregate of all papers including the viva -voce test.the merit of the qualified candidates shall be determined strictly according to the marks obtained by them;provided that in case or more candidates obtain equal marks their merit shall be determined according to the marks secured by them in viva -voce and if the marks in the viva -voce of the candidates are also equal the older in age shall be placed higher in order of merit. rule which is important for the purpose of determination of the matter read as $$$ the result of the examination will be published in the punjab government gazette. ii candidates will be selected for appointment strictly in the order in which they have been placed by the punjab service commission in the list of those who have qualified under rule.provided that in the case of candidates belonging to the scheduled castes / tribes and other backward classes government will have a right to select in order of merit a candidate who has merely qualified under rule irrespective of the position obtained by him in the examination;provided further that the selection of candidates belonging to the scheduled castes / tribes and other $$$ in the order of merit inter se shall be made against the vacancies reserved for them and in the manner prescribed by government from time to time.rules and or part -d governing appointments read thus:". the names of candidates selected by government for appointment of subordinate judges under rules and of part -c shall be entered on the high court register in the order of their selection. there is no limit to the number of names borne on the high court register but ordinarily no more names will be included than are estimated to be sufficient for the filling of vacancies which are anticipated to be likely to occur within years from the date of selection of candidates as a result of an examination. the rules therefore indisputably lay emphasis on merit. it for all int and purport excludes the applicability of rule of appointment in terms of roster points. it is not in dispute that despite absence of any specific rule relating to determining of inter se seniority a long standing practice prevailing in the high court has been that it be determined strictly on the basis of the order of merit. it is relevant to note that the state of haryana had issued instructions on or about.the relevant portions whereof are as under:"it has come to the notice in the matter of fixing seniority there has been misinterpretation of the relevant instructions in some instances and members of scs / bcs been assigned seniority according the serial numbers of the vacancies reserved for them under the block system as indicated below and not as they should have according to the order of candidates determined by the public service commission vacancies reserved for scs / bcs in every block of vacancies 	 ---no. and for bcs.for example when vacancies were to be filled and the and the were reserved for the members of scs schedule castes candidates were placed at sl. no. and serial no. respectively in the combined seniority list of the candidates although the combined seniority list prepared by the psc / sssb their position were lower. it has to be pointed out that this was irregular and inter se seniority of all the candidates taken together i. whether appointed against reserved vacancies or against open s must be fixed according to the combined merit list and not otherwise. vacancies assigned to scs / bcs under the block system for the purpose of reservation only and are not inded for are not assigned fixing inter se seniority of the candidates contrary to their order in the combined merit list prepared by the psc / sssb. this may please be noted for careful compliance so that in future seniority is fixed on this basis in case in which reserved vacancies are filled whether by initial appointment or by promotion. furthermore all earlier cases in which members or scs / bcs and others have been assigned seniority errously in disregard of the order of candidates in the combined merit list should be reviewed and steps taken to refix seniority correctly. for that purposes it will be necessary that the persons who will be affected should be given an opportunity of showing cause why their seniority should not be fixed at a lower place in accordance with the order in the combined merit list such opportunity should be duly allowed before refixing seniority. the contesting parties herein had appeared in the same examination. it is also not in dispute that the results of the said examination were published by the commissir on.. the candidate who could be appointed from amongst the said list were for those vacancies which were existing on that date as also likely to occur upto september. in terms of the rules as referred to hereinbefore their names had to be entered in the register. it was not so d. the right of the candidates who could be appointed in terms of the extant rules was ignored. the interpretation of the rules came up for consideration of this court in $$$ v. state of haryana $$$ / sc/0/9$$$$$$$ / sc/0/9$$$$. having regard to the purport of the said rules it was names of the selected candidates are to be entered in a register maintained by the high court in the order of their selection and appointment are to be made from the names entered in the register in that order. the number of names to be entered in the register maintained by the high court may be sufficient to fill vacancies anticipated to occur within years from the date of selection of candidate as a result of the examination. therefore it appears that the duty of the public service commission in confined to holding the writ examination holding the viva voce test and arranging the order of merit according to marks among the candidates who have qualified as a result of the writ and the viva voce tests. $$$ the public service commission is required to publish the result in the gazette and apparently to make the result available to the government. the public service commission is not required to make further selection from the qualified candidates and is therefore not expected to withhold the names of any qualified candidates. the duty of the public service commission is to make available to the government a complete list of qualified candidates arranged in order of merit. $$$ the government is to make the selection strictly in the order in which they have been placed by the commission as a result of the examination. the names of the selected candidates are then to be entered in the register maintained by the high court strictly in that order and appointments made from the names entered in that register also strictly in the same order. it is of course open to the government not to fill up all the vacancies for a valid reason. it was clearly held that having regard to the rules it was incumbent on the part of the commission to communicate the entire list of qualified candidates to the government. it was held that the commission was not concerned with the number of vacancies at all and as such it could not have been withheld the full list of successful candidates on the ground that only a limited number of vacancies are available. taking note of the fact that like the present case therein also the high court had informed the government that more vacancies were are required to be filled it was observed:"if the government had been aware that there were qualified candidates available they would have surely applied rule of part d and made the necessary selection to be communicated to the high court. the net result is that qualified candidates though available were not selected and were not appointed. miss $$$ is of them. in the view that we have taken of the rules miss $$$ is entitled to be selected for appointment as subordinate judge in the haryana civil service judicial branch. in the aforementid situation this court directed that the names of the petitir them be included in the list of list of candidates. as noticed hereinbefore a bench of this court in state of haryana v. $$$.a. nos. -of as noticed hereinbefore dismissed the special leave petition in respect of ms. manisha batra now ms. manisha chopra holding that a clear vacancy existed. we may further notice that a division bench of the punjab & haryana high court in kamal kant and ors. v. state of haryana and anr. recent services judgments arising out of the same advertisement directed:"in terms of the law laid down by the supreme court in neelima shangla 's case supra we direct the state of haryana to forward the list of candidates who qualified in the examination general and reserved held in december forthwith and the high court would enter the names of such number of candidates as would be necessary in terms of rule of part d of the rules in the register in order of merit. the names of the candidates of the reserved categories would also be brought on the register in the same manner. the high court would then consider to fill up the remaining vacancies and would forward the names of the requisite number of candidates to the state government for appointment as per rule 7( of part d of the rules as subordinate judges under article of the constitution. while doing so it will be open to the high court in the interests of higher standard not to recommend the names of all the candidates who obtained per cent marks and the appointment can be restricted to such number of candidates who obtained higher percentage than sic per cent as may be decided by the high court sic agreed to by the government. in the aforementid backdrop the submission of dr. $$$ is required to be considered. the question as to whether the determination of inter se seniority would depend upon the filling up of the vacancies so far as the reserved categories are concerned having regard to the roster points in our opinion is no longer res integra. in ajit singh and ors. ii v. state of punjab and ors. $$$ / sc/0575/999$$$ / sc/0575/999 air999sc7 a judge bench of this court has laid down the law in the following terms.it must be noted that whenever a reserved candidate goes for recruitment at the initial level say level he is not going through the normal process of selection which is applied to a general candidate but get appointment to a post reserved for his group. that is what is meant by reservation. that is the effect of reservation.now in a case where the reserved candidate has not opted to sic on lus merit but has opted for the reserved post of a roster is set at level for promotion sic the reserved candidate at various roster points to level the reserved candidate if he is otherwise at the end of the merit list goes to level without competing with general candidates and he goes up by a large number of places. in a sic with places if the roster points are sic etc at each of these points the reserved candidate if he is at the end of the merit list gets promotion to level by side -stepping several general candidates. that is the effect of the roster- point promotion.it deserves to be noticed that the roster points fixed at level are not inded to determine any seniority at level between general candidates and the reserved candidates. this aspect we shall consider again when we come to mervyn continho v. collector of customs $$$ / sc/00/9$$$$$$$$$$$ / sc/00/9$$$$$$$$ lower down. the roster point merely becomes operative whenever a vacancy reserved at level becomes available. once such vacancies are all filled the roster has worked itself out. $$$ other reserved candidates can be promoted only when a vacancy at the reserved points already filled arises. that was what was decided in r.k. sabharwal v. state of punjab $$$ / sc/059/995$$$ / sc/059/995. in ajit singh ii the decision of this court in r.k. sabharwal case has thus been explained. p.s. sic v. state of haryana and ors. $$$ / sc/009/99$$$$$$$ / sc/009/99$$$$ air99$$$$sc5 relied upon by dr. $$$ is a decision rendered by a judge bench. in that case rule of the rules envisaged that the seniority inter se of members of the service shall be determined by the length of continuous service on any post in the service provided further that in the case of or more members appointed by direct recruitment the order of merit determined by the commission shall not be disturbed in fixing the seniority. despite the said rule it was held:"take for instance $$$. and as pointed out in the chief secretary 's letter have admittedly been reserved for scheduled castes. suppose recruitment was made to fill up vacancies candidates from scheduled castes were selected on the basis of reserved quota. the question is whether the candidate will be put in the quota allotted to the scheduled castes in the roster. having been selected as a general candidate though he is more meritorious than the and candidates he will not get the placement in the roster reserved for scheduled castes i. nos. and points. consequently candidates nos. and will get the placement at nos. and and the candidate will get the placement in the order of merit along with the general candidates according to the order of merit maintained by the selection committee or the public service commission. he can not complain that having been selected in the merit he must be placed in the placement reserved for scheduled castes at point no. in the roster. equally though general candidate is more meritorious in the order of merit prepared by the public service commission or the selection committee when the appointments are made and the vacancies are filled up according to the roster necessarily and inevitably the reserved candidates though less meritorious in the order of merit maintained by the public service commission would occupy the respective places assigned in the roster. thereby they steal a march over some of the general candidates and get seniority over the general candidates. this scheme is therefore constitutional valid and is not arbitrary. we have not been able to persuade ourselves to the aforesaid view. in a.i.i.m.s. students union v. a.i.i.m.s. and ors. $$$ / sc/00/001$$$ / sc/00/001 air001sc36 his court observed:"reservation as an exception may be justified subject to discharging the burden of proving justification in favour of the class which must be educationally handicapped -the reservation geared up to getting over the handicap. the rationale of reservation in the case of medical students must be removal of regional or class inadequacy or like disadvantage. even there the quantum of reservation should not be excessive or societally injurious. the higher the level of the speciality the lesser the role of reservation.any reservation apart from being sustainable on the constitutional anvil must also be reasonable to be permissible. in assessing the reasonability of the factors to be taken into consideration would be whether the character and quantum of reservation would stall or accelerate achieving the ultimate goal of excellence enabling the national constantly rising to higher levels. in the era of globalisation where the nation as a whole has to compete with other nations of the world so as to survive excellence can not be given an unreasonable go by and certainly not compromised in its entirety. fundamental duties though not enforceable by a writ of the court yet provide a valuable guide and aid to interpretation of constitutional and legal issues. in case of doubt or choice people 's wish as manifested through article -a can serve as a guide not only for resolving the issue but also for constructing or moulding the relief to be given by the courts. in k. duraisamy and anr. v. state of t.n. and ors.$$$ / sc/00/001$$$ / sc/00/001 this court held:"the mere use of the word reservation per se does not have the consequence of ipso facto applying the entire mechanism underlying the constitutional concept of a protective reservation specially designed for the advancement of any socially -and -educationally -backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to enable them to enter and adequately represent in various fields. the meaning content and purport of the expression will necessarily depend upon the purpose and object with which it sic used. an affirmative action in terms of article of the constitution is meant for providing a representation of class of citizenry who are socially or economically backward. article of the constitution of india is applicable in the case of an appointment. it does not speak of fixation of seniority. seniority is thus not to be fixed in terms of the roster points. if that is d the rule of affirmative action would be extended which would strictly not be in consonance of the constitutional schemes. we are of the opinion that the decision in p.s. $$$ does not lay down a good law. in all india judges association 's case this court was considering the matter relating to implementation of recommendations of shetty 's commission as regard the fixation of pay scales of the judicial officers. this court noticed that sometimes merit suffers because of seniority. it was directed:"we direct that recruitment to the higher judicial service i.the cadre of district judges will be:(1)(a per cent by promotion from amongst the civil judges senior division on the basis of principle of merit -cum -seniority and passing a suitability per cent by promotion strictly on the basis of merit through limited competitive examination of civil judges senior division having not less than years ' qualifying service $$$ per cent of the posts shall be filled by direct recruitment from amongst the eligible advocates on the basis of the written and viva voce test conducted by respective high courts.appropriate rules shall be framed as above by the high court as early as possible. only in relation to such promotion the court noticed that there exists a quota system in different sources of recruitment in service in so far as seniority is concerned and whence roster system is followed the sic in the country has been lessor. in a case where there(sic different sources of sic to a service and quota of appointment for each source of recruitment is fixed under the rules the seniority vis -a -vis of different sources of recruits could legally fixed sic roster points. it was in that situation a desire was expressed that quotas be specified in relation to posts as contradistinguished from sic relation to sic. this court therefore directed the high courts to amend and promulgate seniority rules in the light of the decision sic supra. it was clearly laid down.it is obvious that this system can only apply prospectively except where under the relevant rules seniority is to be determined on the basis of quota and rotational system. the existing relative seniority of the members of the higher judicial service has to be protected but the roster has to be evolved for the future. appropriate rules and methods will be adopted by the high court and approved by the states wherever necessary by --. the said decision can not be said to have any application whatsoever in determining inter se seniority as regards vacancies required to be filled up in the years -. reliance by dr. $$$ on the decision of this court in direct recruit class ii $$$ing officers ' association v. state of maharashtra and ors. quoted in $$$ / sc/0291/1990$$$ / sc/0291/1990 is equally misplaced. a question which arose therein for consideration was inter se seniority between direct recruits and promotees as there existed quota rules and furthermore appointments were also made on ad hoc basis. it is in that situation this court inter alia observed a once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule his seniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the date of his confirmation. the corollary of the above rule is that where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as stop -gap arrangement the officiation in such post can not be taken into account for considering the seniority. the said decision was rendered also having been regard to dispute as to whether the date of confirmation would be the measure for determining inter se seniority. in union of india v. s.s. uppal and anr. $$$ / sc/0592/1996$$$ / sc/0592/1996 it has been held the provisions of $$$ and of the constitution of india imply that a process should be adopted while making appointment though direct recruitment or promotion in which the merit is not affected. it is also well settled that in the absence of rules governing seniority an executive order may be issued to fill up the gap. only in the absence of a rule or executive instructions the court may have to evolve a fair and just principle which could be applied in the facts and circumstances of the case. in union of india v. m.l.  $$$ / sc/0405/1973$$$ / sc/0405/1973 this court held:"merit is certainly an elusive factor capable of being judged very differently from different angles or by applications of varying tests of it by different persons or by the same persons at different times. it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that to make supposed merit the sole test for selection would be to leave the door wide open for nepotism to creep into selections for higher rungs of public service by promotion and that this would undermine the morale of members of the state services and weaken incentives for hst work and achievement of better standards of proficiency by them.the following passage from $$$. white 's introduction of public administration edn. pages cited with approval by this court in sant ram sharma 's case $$$ / sc/0330/1967$$$ / sc/0330/1967 196)iillj30sc was quoted by the division bench the principal object of a promotion system is to secure the best possible incumbents for the higher positions while maintaining the morale of the whole organization. the main interest to be served is the public interest not the personal interest of members of the official group concerned. the public interest is best secured when reasonable opportunities for promotion exist for all qualified employees when really superior civil servants are enabled to move as rapidly up the promotion ladder as their merits deserve and as vacancies occur and when selection for promotion is made on the sole basis of merit for the merit system ought to apply as specifically in making promotions as in original recruitment..employees often prefer the rule of seniority by which the eligible longest in service is automatically awarded the promotion. within limits seniority is entitled to consideration as criterion of selection. it tends to eliminate favouritism or the suspicion thereof and experience is certainly a factor in the making of a successful employee. seniority is given most weight in promotions from the lowest to other subordinate positions. as employees move up the ladder of responsibility it is entitled to less and less weight. when seniority is made the sole determining factor at any level it is a dangerous guide. it does not follow that the employee longest in service in a particular grade is best suited for promotion to a higher grade the very opposite may be true. seniority is not a fundamental right. it is merely a civil right. inter se seniority of the candidates who are appointed on $$$$ would be dependant on the rules governing the same. only in absence of any statutory rules the general principles may be held to be applicable. it has been noticed hereinbefore that the punjab & haryana high court in exercise of its power of control under article of the constitution of india had been determining inter se seniority of the candidates in terms of the instructions of the state dated 27th april as quoted supra. in absence of any statutory rules the said practice was developed which can not be said to be arbitrary. in any event such practice can not be interfered at this stage keeping in view the fact that the rights of a large number of officers must have already been determined in terms thereof. in the instance case the respondents nos. to admittedly were more meritorious. they were unjustly deprived of their right of appointment although they were entitled thereto having regard to rule of the rules. they suffered for no fault on their part. they had to approach the high court for ventilating their grievances. the high court directed the respondent herein to make appointment and only pursuant thereto and in furtherance thereof they were appointed. should they in aforementioned situation be permitted to lose their seniority is the question involved in this appeal the answer thereto must be rendered in the negative. long standing practice as well as justice and equity favour the respondents. it is beyond any cavil that merit has a role to play in the matter of determination of inter se seniority. in sic commander j. $$$ v. union of india and ors. $$$ / sc/0202/192$$$ / sc/0202/192 this court laid down the law in the following terms:"further the impugned rules are statutory in origin as they have been promulgated by the president of india under the proviso to article of the constitution. rule contains a categorical declaration that in the past also the seniority of service officers permanently ed to the r & d organisation was being reckoned on the basis of their dates of attainment of substantive rank of major $$$. $$$. ltd. cdr.subject to any penalty loss of seniority that an officer might suffer subsequently. the declaration is clearly implied in the opening words as hitherto fore occurring in rule of the impugned rules. a statement contained in a statute or statutory rule of the factual background leading up to the enactment has ordinarily to be accepted to be acted upon by the court as wholly correct nothing clinching has been brought to our notice by the appellant to justify any departure from the said principle. we do not therefore find it possible to accept the contention of the appellant that prior to the coming into force of the impugned rule he had acquired a vested right to have his seniority in the r & d reckoned with reference to the date of his permanent mint and to have all officers joining the organisation on subsequent dates ranked only below him. the plea advanced by the appellant that the impugned rules have illegally purported to divest him of his vested rights of seniority and promotion in the r & d must therefore be rejected as devoid of merit. in this case also although there does not exist any statutory rule but the practice of determining inter se seniority on the basis of the merit list has been evolved on interpretation of the rules. a select list is prepared keeping in view the respective merit of the candidates. not only appointments are required to be made on the basis of such merit list seniority is also to be determined on that basis as it is expected that the candidates should be joining their respective posts almost at the same time. yet again in chairman puri gramya bank and anr. v. $$$ das and ors. $$$ / sc/0/1994$$$ / sc/0/1994 this court held:"it is settled law that if more than are selected the seniority is as per ranking of the direct recruits subject to the adjustment of the candidates selected on applying the rule of reservation and the roster. by mere fortuitous chance of reporting to duty earlier would not alter the ranking given by the selection board and the arranged as per roster. the high court is therefore wholly wrong in its conclusion that the seniority shall be determined on the basis of the joining reports given by the candidates selected for appointment by direct recruitment and length of service on its basis. in pilla sitaram patrudu and ors. v. union of india and ors. reported in manu / sc/0067/1997manu / sc/0067/1997 it was held:"it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that since the inter se seniority as $$$ was left open in the order the directions given by the tribunal to consider the case as $$$ and determine his seniority on the basis of promotion is not valid in law. we find no force in the contention. once he is found to be eligible according to the rules then his seniority is required to be determined as per the procedure prescribed in the rules in vogue. it is further contended that the respondent was not qualified since he had not completed years of required service. the tribunal has recorded a finding that years period is relaxable in the case of the reserved candidate. the inter se seniority as assistant executive $$$ is required to be determined he joined service in and therefore he did not have the requisite service. we find no force in the contention. since sic was selected by direct recruitment he is entitled to be appointed according to rule. his appointment was delayed for no fault of his and he came to be appointed in he is therefore entitled to the ranking given in the select list and appointment made accordingly. under these circumstances we do not find any illegality in the order. furthermore it is now well settled that a settled seniority position should not be unsettled. the respondents had already been posted to the post of additional district judge. as would appear from the report of the sub -committee that the seniority list was published in the year. representations were however made only in the year which was rejected by the high court on 22nd august. the writ petition was filed in march which was dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment dated.. for the foregoing reasons we do not find any merit in this appeal. it is dismissed accordingly. however in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
