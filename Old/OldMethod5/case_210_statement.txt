v. $$$ j. leave granted in all the special leave petitions. the present appeals filed separately arise from the impugned judgment and order dated.passed in r.v.w. no. of and judgment and final order dated.passed in c.o. no. $$$$ by the high court of judicature at $$$ whereby the high court refused to interfere with the impugned judgments therein. the appeals arising out of s.l.p. c nos. -of have been preferred by the bengal ambuja housing development ltd.whereas the appeals arising out of s.l.p. c nos. -of have been preferred by the west bengal housing board. both sets of appeals are being disposed of by this common judgment. as the facts in both the appeals are common for the sake of convenience we refer to the facts of the appeals arising out of s.l.p. c nos. -of which are stated in brief hereunder the $$$ west bengal housing board hereinafter the housing board is a statutory body constituted under the west bengal housing board act with the objective of providing affordable housing in the state of west bengal. the $$$ is the current owner of the suit property in question in the present appeals. the predecessor -in -interest of the $$$ late $$$ was the owner of suit land measuring.acres of land. a suit for partition being title suit no. of was instituted in the land adjacent to the said land among the co -owners namely $$$ $$$ mondal and $$$ family in the year before the learned civil judge senior division alipore the said suit was renumbered subsequently as title suit no. of. $$$ was not a party to the said suit at its inception. he was impleaded as defendant no. vide order of the learned trial court dated.. $$$ died in june. mr. $$$ was appointed as the $$$ over the said suit properties and he took possession of the entire suit properties on november. after $$$ died the defendant no. in the suit no. of filed an application before the learned subordinate judge alipore intimating that among others defendant no. $$$ had died during the pendency of the suit following which the suit had abated against them as per the provisions of order xxii rules and code of civil procedure. the learned subordinate judge vide order and judgment dated.dismissed the entire suit under order xxii of the code of civil procedure holding that the suit had abated as against the deceased $$$ including $$$ and the right to sue did not survive as against the other surviving $$$. the learned subordinate judge held as under there is authority to hold that no formal order of abatement need be made as a suit or appeal abates automatically if no application for substitution is made within the prescribed time i. within days from the date of death and not from the date of knowledge. in that view of the matter the order of abatement as recorded above by order no. dated.was a mere formality. sub -rule of rule of order code of civil procedure provides that the suit shall abate as against the deceased defendant in case no application is made under sub -rule within the time allowed by law. abatement takes place by operation of law and it is this crystal clear that the suit has abated against the deceased $$$. in due course of law..$$$ by the same the plaintiffs therein filed title appeal no. of before the learned district judge alipore. the learned district judge vide order dated.held that the order passed by learned subordinate judge was improper and not justified and remanded the matter back to be considered afresh. the learned civil judge sr. divn.after considering the matter afresh held that the plaintiffs had not made out any sufficient ground for the delay in filing of the application and refused to cond the delay and rejected the application of the plaintiffs therein. the learned civil judge sr. divn.held as under it is an established principal of law that the suit abates on and from the date of death of a party to the suit. from the order no. dated.it is seen that the petition giving the information of the death of the defendants in question. the petitirs waited without any lawful exercise upon.. on.they asked for letter particulars on the grounds mentid in the petition. by order no. dated.the court directed the defendant no. to furnish particulars as regards the names and addresses of the deceased defendants nos. and by.. from order no. dated.it is seen that the defendant no. complied with the direction of the court from all of these developments it is palpably clear that the petitirs were in the know of the death of the defendants in question right from.. at any rate when all particulars were furnished to them on.the petitirs ought to have filed the application for setting aside the abatement at least within days from the date of abatement or order of the dismissal in terms of provisions of articles and of the old limitation act. they filed the petition on.for the lapse of days plus days even the period is calculated from..this order of abatement has attained finality as no appeal has been preferred by the parties against the same. in the meanwhile the land of late $$$ was acquired by the state government and came to be vested in them vide order dated.passed in big raiyat case no. of. in the order of vesting was challenged by the heirs of $$$ by way of a $$$ c.o. no. w of. the learned single judge allowed the $$$ and quashed the order of vesting dated.. $$$ of the order passed in the above $$$ the state government preferred $$$ before the hon'ble division bench against the decision of the learned single judge. the learned division bench dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the learned single judge vide judgment and order dated.. the state government then preferred civil appeal no. of before this court which was dismissed vide judgment and order dated.in the case of west bengal government employees food and supplies cooperative housing society ltd. and ors. v. sulekha $$$ dey and ors. reported in $$$ / sc/3/$$$$$$$ / sc/3/$$$$ scc when this court held as under:. so far as the case on hand is concerned it is seen from the materials on record that effective actual and physical possession of the properties appears to have continued with the intermediary in question and subsequently in the possession of his heirs and the collector / revenue officer could not be said to have either dispossessed them or taken over physical or khas possession of the estate and the rights comprised therein in the manner statutorily mandated and provided for under section of the act and rule of the rules made thereunder. the learned single judge and the division bench of the high court recorded concurrently that khas possession continued with the intermediary and after him his heirs and we find nothing contra concretely to disturb the same. the professed taking over of possession seems to be a mere entry on paper but not in conformity with the mandatory procedure necessarily to be observed before such possession could be lawfully carried out. we are not concerned with the internal controversy between the cooperative housing society of its claim to have been given with possession pursuant to the agreement of sale since for the purposes of the act it is the dispossession by the collector / revenue officer in the manner envisaged in the statutory provisions under the rules made thereunder that al could get legitimatised for determining the rights of parties. consequently the order of the learned single judge as well as the order of the division bench insofar as they sustained the right in the respondents herein to express their choice of retention can not be said to suffer from any infirmity in law so as to call for our interference. as a matter of fact it is seen from the materials placed on record that after the order of the learned single judge on the respondents exercising their choice an order dated.came to be passed by the revenue officer allowing retention of acres of agricultural land.acres of non -agricultural land and.acres of homestead land as per b schedule to the said proceedings and declaring that.acres of agricultural land and.acres of homestead land as per details contained in the c schedule to the said proceedings stood vested in the state. this order which appears to have been made subject to the result of the appeal has to be construed in that manner and the rights of parties thereunder could and ought to be only in terms of and subject to the modified order of the division bench and nothing more.... the vesting is total and complete once notification is issued under section and got published by the combined operation of sections and of the act and what is secured under section is the right to hold on to the possession subject to the limits prescribed in the statute by option for retention of the same before khas possession of the properties have been taken over as envisaged under section of the act.the ownership of the plot of land was thus retained by the legal heirs of $$$ as intermediaries as provided under section of the west bengal estates acquisition act. on.the plaintiff -respondents herein filed an application under order xxxix rules and code of civil procedure in title suit no. of seeking for grant of a temporary injunction restraining the parties from alienating encumbering or creating party interest on the scheduled properties. the learned subordinate judge alipore vide order dated.allowed the application for temporary injunction and passed the purported consent order even though the legal heirs of late $$$ had not given their consent directing the parties to maintain status quo with respect to the suit properties and restrained them from selling transferring alienating inter party or with any party or in any manner whatsoever from changing the nature and character of the suit property till disposal of the suit. on.the learned trial court at the instance of the plaintiffs -respondents directed the officer in charge purba jadavpur police station to ensure compliance of the order dated.. on.the learned subordinate judge alipore allowed the amendment application dated.by which inter alia the plot of land belonging to the heirs of $$$ was added to the suit schedule properties appended to the plaint. while passing the order the learned subordinate judge held as under on perusal of the instant applications under consideration and after hearing the submissions of the learned advocates court comes to the conclusion that the amendment is formal in nature and would not change the nature and character of the suit neither would it prejudice any of the parties. besides it is even observed by the court that the instant suit can not proceed without amendment be allowed.it is important to note at this stage that the heirs of late $$$ were not heard during the proceedings as they were not parties to the suit. on.the $$$ housing board acquired ownership of the property by way of registered conveyance deeds the title and possession of the said.acres of land from the successors -in -interest of the late $$$. on.of the plaintiffs respondents herein filed a petition before the learned subordinate judge alipore praying that the superintendent of police south paraganas and the officer in charge of purba jadavpur be directed to ensure compliance with the orders of temporary injunction passed by the trial court on.and.in respect of the property in dispute. the learned subordinate judge vide order dated.directed the superintendent of police to see that the consent order of temporary injunction granted by the civil court in favour of the plaintiffs -respondents in the original suit in respect of the suit properties in dispute was maintained by the parties. aggrieved by the said order the bengal ambuja housing development ltd. $$$ herein filed an application c.o. no. of before the hon'ble high court under article of the constitution of india questioning the correctness of the same. the high court vide its judgment and order dated.dismissed the same. the high court held that the party $$$ housing board had purchased the suit property lis pendens and that no permission was taken from the court for the same. thus the provisions of section of the transfer of property act would govern the transaction. the high court while dismissing the application filed by the bengal ambuja housing development ltd.held as under the present mater is confined to the implementation of an order of injunction passed on consent. as recorded above upon hearing both the parties an order of status quo was passed directing the parties not to change the nature and character of the suit property. when the applicant tried to intervene in the said order of status quo the steps for rendering police help for the learned $$$ was taken and i think since an order of status quo was passed in consent was prevailing the learned court was justified for giving necessary directions upon the concerned police authority to take appropriate steps for the preservation and protection of the suit property and the court was also competent to give directions to the police authority to render possible helps that the possession taken by the present $$$ namely $$$ be maintained.from the above facts it is clear that the -party / petitir herein had purchased the suit property lis pendens and that no permission was sought for from the court to purchase the suit property.so the principle of lis pendens as provided in section of the transfer of property act shall govern the issue..the learned trial judge is justified to pass the impugned order. record does not show that the petitirs had obtained any permission from the court to purchase a portion of the suit property. they had purchased a portion of the suit property at their own risk while the said suit was pending and the property was in the possession of the learned $$$. aggrieved by the order the $$$ bengal ambuja housing development ltd. filed an s.l.p. c no. of before this court challenging the legality of the said order which petition was dismissed as withdrawn by granting liberty to file the appropriate application before the high court. the abovesaid $$$ then filed a review application r.v.w. no. of before the high court of calcutta to review the judgment and order passed in c.o. no. of urging various tenable grounds. the high court by its judgment and order dated.has dismissed the review application. the high court held that the grounds urged by the $$$ in the review petition did not warrant a review of its judgment dated.. the high court further held that it must be considered that the judge who rendered the judgment was no longer available with the court and that the liberty that a judge has to correct himself upon his mistake being brought to his notice is not available to another judge hearing the review and therefore the review petition was rejected by passing the order which is also impugned in this appeal. hence the present appeals were filed by the above $$$s. we have heard the learned senior counsel for both the parties. on the basis of the factual evidence on record produced before us the circumstances of the case and also in the light of the rival legal contentions urged by the learned senior counsel for both the parties we have broadly framed the following points which require our attention and consideration:. whether the appeals filed by the $$$ housing board are maintainable in view of the fact that the earlier slp filed by the $$$ bengal ambuja housing development ltd. was dismissed with liberty accorded to it to file appropriate petition before the high court?. whether the order of temporary injunction dated.passed by the learned subordinate judge alipore passed in respect of the suit property without impleading the vendors and the $$$ housing board which had acquired the right title interest upon the same can be enforced against them through the jurisdictional police as has been granted by the learned subordinate judge alipore though the sale deed in favour of the board is not challenged by the plaintiffs -respondents and the said order can be enforced against the $$$s through jurisdictional police by an order dated.passed in the title suit?3. whether the inclusion of the property of the housing board to the suit instituted in the civil court by way of an amendment by the plaintiffs -respondents which property was conferred upon the legal heirs of late $$$ as intermediary right holder under section of the west bengal acquisition of estates act and the institution of suit for partition by the contesting respondents is barred by the provisions of sections and of the act of. what order?answer to point no. mr. j.p. cama the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of some of the plaintiffs -respondents strongly made the submission that since the earlier slp of the $$$ -bengal ambuja housing development ltd. was dismissed as withdrawn by an order of this court dated.in the case of bengal ambuja housing development limited and anr. v. $$$ and ors.it is no longer open to the said $$$ to challenge the correctness of the original order passed by the high court by way of filing other slps again. in support of the above legal submissions the learned senior counsel has placed reliance on the decision of this court in the case of kumaran silk trade p.ltd. v. devendra and ors. $$$ / sc/8/$$$$$$$ / sc/8/$$$$ scc wherein it has been held as under since the petition for special leave to appeal has already been dismissed by this court it is no more open to the petitir to seek challenge to challenge the original order in this court again by invoking article of the constitution of india....it is not open to the petitir to challenge the original order again in this court after withdrawing the earlier appeal reserving only a liberty in itself of seeking a review of the original order. the learned senior counsel also contends that an appeal is not maintainable against the decision of a court in a review petition. he places reliance on the decision of this court in the case of shanker motiram nale v. shiolalsing gannusing rajput scc wherein it has been held as under this appeal is obviously incompetent. it is against an order of a division bench of the high court rejecting the application for review of a judgment and decree passed by a learned single judge who seems to have retired in the meantime. it is not against the basic judgment. order rule of code of civil procedure bars an appeal against the order of the court rejecting the review. on this basis we reject the appeal.this case has been relied upon by this court in the cases of vinod kapoor v. state of goa manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc and m.n. haider v. $$$ scc. the learned senior counsel on behalf of the respondents submits that the earlier slp filed by bengal ambuja housing development ltd. was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to file an appropriate petition before the high court to review its order questid in the earlier slps. since liberty was not given to it to challenge that very same impugned order once again by filing slps in the event of review petition being dismissed the appeals filed by bengal ambuja housing development ltd. once again challenging the very same order is not legally permissible. this contention has been very vehemently disputed by learned attorney general mr. rohatgi who contends that the impugned order was not challenged by the $$$ housing board before this court and that the interim order of temporary injunction and order dated.directing the jurisdictional police to enforce the order of temporary injunction are not binding and can not be enforced against it as it was not a party to the original suit proceedings at any point of time. it is further contended that it has acquired valid interest and title upon the property in dispute as the legal heirs of late $$$ have executed the sale deed of the property in its favour which land stood retained by them in terms of the decision of this court in the case of sulekha $$$ referred to supra. thus the order of temporary injunction passed in the original suit proceedings in respect of the property in dispute without impleading either the vendors of the $$$ housing board or the heirs of the late $$$ to the original suit proceedings can not be said to have a binding effect on the $$$ housing board. therefore the learned subordinate judge ought to have taken this aspect of the matter into consideration while directing the superintendent of police south paraganas to enforce the interim order of temporary injunction against bengal ambuja housing development ltd.which is the lease holder as the board has granted lease hold rights in its favour to develop the property by joint venture to provide residential accommodation to the economically weaker sections of the society which is a laudable object of the board under the statutory provisions of the west bengal housing board act. thus the aforesaid decisions of this court upon which reliance has been placed by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of some of the plaintiffs -respondents can not be applied either against the $$$ housing board or its lessee or any other person claiming through it as it was not a party to the proceedings and it did not challenge the said order earlier before this court and therefore the civil appeals filed by it are maintainable.answer to point nos. and. the learned trial court passed an order of status quo on.restraining the defendants therein from selling transferring creating party interest or otherwise disposing of the suit scheduled properties. the said interim order of temporary injunction was purportedly a consent order. on.though the legal heirs of late $$$ were not brought on record the learned trial court allowed the amendment application dated.to amend the suit schedule properties. mr. $$$ learned attorney general and mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$s contend that the high court failed to consider that neither the $$$s herein nor the predecessor -in -interest of the $$$s were parties to the suit no. of before the learned subordinate judge alipore and thus they were not aware of the order of temporary injunction that had been passed in the said suit proceedings. the learned senior counsel further contend that the high court erred in not appreciating the fact that the said plot of land was not a part of the suit scheduled property originally. it appears to have been included in the suit schedule as of the properties after the death of ganga $$$ and abatement of the suit proceedings against him without bringing his legal heirs on record. the status quo order passed in the original suit sought to be enforced against the $$$s was passed after the suit was abated against late $$$ and without bringing his legal heirs on record. the original suit had abated against him by order dated.the suit being title suit no. of. further the land of late $$$ was only included in the suit properties on.that too without making the heirs of late $$$ as parties to the said proceedings or informing them about the same. it was further contended that by the learned senior counsel that the high court failed to appreciate that neither the $$$s nor their predecessors in title and interest the legal heirs of late $$$ upon the property involved in these proceedings were made parties to the suit and therefore the question of giving consent by them to the interim orders dated.and.does not and can not arise especially in light of the fact that the order of abatement of the original suit proceedings as against late $$$ had attained finality. it was further contended by mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ bengal ambuja housing development ltd. that the high court had failed to consider the scope of the principle of lis pendens under section of the transfer of property act. the property which has been purchased by the $$$ housing board was not transferred by any party to the title suit no. of. the information slip issued by the alipore court makes it clear that the names of the heirs of late $$$ were not included as parties to the title suit no. of. on the other hand mr. $$$ learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent -$$$ contends that the $$$s presently do not have the locus standi to challenge any subsequent orders passed in the title suit no. of. the property in dispute upon which the claim is made by them being a portion of the suit property is governed by the principle of lis pendens as provided under the transfer of property act. the learned senior counsel further contends that the high court has rightly observed that no serious prejudice has been occasioned to the $$$s on account of the order passed by the learned subordinate judge to enforce the interim order of temporary injunction through the jurisdictional police. an order of status quo had been passed by trial court as far back as.. the parties were restrained from selling transferring alienating or otherwise disposing of the suit property to any party in any manner whatsoever. there was also an order of temporary injunction restraining the parties from changing the nature and character of the suit property. the property in question being a part of the suit property could not have been transferred in favour of the $$$ housing board during pendency of the restrain order. therefore it is urged by the learned senior counsel that no indulgence ought to be shown to the $$$s in any manner whatsoever to interfere with the impugned orders by this court in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. we have heard mr. $$$ learned attorney general and mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ and mr. $$$ and mr. j.p. cama the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents and have perused the documents produced before us in civil appeals in support of their respective claims to consider the rival legal contentions urged on behalf of the parties and answer the points that are framed in these appeals. we agree with the contentions advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$s. the original suit instituted by the plaintiff -respondents against late $$$ had abated vide order of the learned subordinate judge alipore dated.. the said order has attained finality as no appeal has been filed questioning the correctness of the same. by order dated.passed by the learned subordinate judge the property in question of late $$$ was added as part to the suit schedule properties by way of an amendment to the plaint by the time his legal heirs had already acquired intermediary rights under section of the west bengal estates acquisition act. the heirs of late $$$ were not made parties to the said title suit proceedings. on.the learned subordinate judge passed an order granting temporary injunction restraining the parties to the suit from alienating or transferring the suit property. a perusal of annexure p/0 which is the information slip dated.issued by the office of the learned trial court in title suit no. of makes it amply clear that the heirs of late $$$ were not made parties to the suit. the $$$ housing board purchased the land in question from the heirs of late $$$ on.as is evidenced from the conveyance deed annexure p-9. the $$$ housing board was not a party to the title suit at any point of time. it has purchased the land in question from its owners. this property was included in the suit schedule properties by way of amendment to the plaint after an application was allowed by order dated.. the plaintiffs -respondents herein did not have any right to get the said land included as part of the suit schedule properties for partition and the learned subordinate judge erred in allowing the application to amend the suit schedule to include the property in question. the learned subordinate judge has erred in passing order of temporary injunction under order xxxix rules and of the code of civil procedure in respect of the property in question after it was included to the suit schedule as order of temporary injunction can be granted against only the parties to the suit property. further the grant of police protection without impleading the $$$s to the original suit proceedings is also not legally permissible and the therefore the said order is liable to be set aside. the high court ought to have considered the relevant fact that the $$$s were not parties to the suit and the suit had abated as against late $$$. thus the order of temporary injunction passed by the learned subordinate judge on.does not apply to the land in question which was sold to the $$$ housing board. further in the instant case the order of temporary injunction dated.was purportedly granted by consent is also not sustainable in law. the question of consent being given by either the $$$ housing board or the predecessors in interest who are its vendors did not arise as they were not parties to the said suit. it is a well settled principle of law that either temporary or permanent injunction can be granted only against the parties to a suit. further the purported consent order in terms of order xxxix of the code of civil procedure is only binding as against the parties to the suit. in such a case the order of the subordinate judge to grant police protection against the $$$ housing board which is enjoying the property is erroneous in law and is liable to be set aside. the original owner in the instant case late $$$ was an intermediary in khas possession of the land in question in terms of section of the west bengal estates acquisition act. thus the learned subordinate judge did not have the jurisdiction to entertain any suit with respect to the said property in light of the provision of section and of the west bengal estates acquisition act which states as under:7b. bar to jurisdiction of civil court in respect of certain matters.no civil court shall entertain any suit or application concerning any land or any estate or any right in such estate if it relates to-(a alteration of any entry in the record -of -rights finally published revised made corrected or modified under any of the provisions of chapter v,(b a dispute involving determination of the question either expressly or by implication whether a raiyat or an intermediary is or is not entitled to retain under the provisions of this act such land or estate or right in such estate as the case may be or(c any matter which under any of the provisions of this act is to be or has already been enquired into decided dealt with or determined by the state government or any authority specified therein.in view of the fact that the right title and interest upon the disputed property has been settled in favour of the vendors of the $$$ housing board who are the legal heirs of the late $$$ who was an intermediary of the land in question in terms of section of the west bengal estates acquisition act adding of the property in question to the suit schedule property in dispute can not be the subject matter of partition in view of the express provisions of the west bengal estates acquisition act which excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court in respect of any rights in such estate as entry in record of rights is published. in the instant case the names of the heirs of late $$$ were included in the record of rights in pursuance of the order passed in the writ petitions in connection with the big raiyat case no. of which order was affirmed by this court in the case of sulekha $$$ referred to supra. the amendment of plaint to include the suit property of the heirs of late $$$ was done in pursuance of the order dated.wherein the learned subordinate judge alipore added the land in question which has been sold to the $$$ housing board to the schedule of suit lands in title suit no. of. the same is erroneous in law and therefore liable to be set aside as the said order is not binding on the $$$ for the reasons stated supra.answer to point no. the order of temporary injunction passed in favour of the plaintiffs -respondents is accordingly set aside in so far as it relates to the property of the $$$ housing board is concerned which property was included by way of an amendment to the plaint. at the end it was brought to our notice by mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ that the $$$ housing board has entered into a joint venture settlement with bengal ambuja housing development ltd. without following the mandatory procedure of inviting applications to participate in the tender to get the leasehold rights for the joint development of the property in question to discharge its statutory obligation. it was further contended by the learned senior counsel that in not doing so the action of the $$$ housing board has become arbitrary unreasonable and unfair as it amounts to conferring largesse upon the $$$ bengal ambuja housing development ltd. the learned senior counsel contended that this is impermissible in law as has been held in a catena of cases by this court in relation to the property owned by the central or state government or statutory boards or corporations or companies owned by either the central or state governments including the case of ramana dayaram shetty v. the international airport authority of india manu / sc/0048/1979manu / sc/0048/1979 air sc which was relied upon in the more recent decision of $$$ v. state of madhya pradesh manu / sc/4/$$$$manu / sc/4/$$$$ scc. the learned senior counsel further contends that this court has laid down the law with reference to article of the constitution of india keeping in view as to how to alienate public property by granting reasonable rates and granting agency of joint venture without following the mandatory procedure of inviting applications from the competent persons so that the persons may come forward and participate in the proceedings to give fair and better offer in the interest of public. that has not been done by the $$$ housing board in the instant case. thus public interest has been adversely affected as a result of the arbitrary and unreasonable action on the part of the $$$ housing board in granting leasehold rights for the joint development of the property in question. the learned senior counsel has prayed that the $$$ housing board be directed to dispose of the property and make good the schemes in the interest of the beneficiaries and utilize the same for their benefit. the above contention of the learned senior counsel can not be dealt with by us as the same is not in controversy in the present case before us. the aggrieved parties are at liberty to seek the above mentioned prayer in an appropriate proceeding. since we have answered the points formulated in these appeals in favour of the $$$ housing board by recording the reasons in the judgment we have to allow the appeals of the $$$ housing board. we pass the following order the appeals of the $$$ housing board are allowed by holding that parte interim order of temporary injunction passed on.by the learned subordinate judge alipore in title suit no. of in respect of the property in question purchased from the legal heirs of the late $$$ who are declared as intermediaries under section of the act of and therefore the same are not binding on this $$$ as it is not a party to the proceedings and the civil court did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the said property as per section and of the west bengal estates acquisition act of.since the interim order of temporary injunction is not binding on the appellant housing board and can not be operated against them therefore the question of enforcing the same against the appellant housing board or its agents or any person claiming through it through the jurisdictional police to help the plaintiffs -respondents as has been granted by the learned subordinate judge by his orders dated.and.at the request of the plaintiffs -respondents does not arise.in view of the appeals of the appellant housing board being allowed the appeals filed by the bengal ambuja housing development ltd. are disposed of as they are unnecessary. all interlocutory applications are disposed of.
