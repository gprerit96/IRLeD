short hearing before us another question has surfaced such is does the chief justice or his nominee acting under section have the authority to decide any contentious issues between the parties to the alleged arbitration agreement in other words is the power of the chief justice or his nominee under section restricted to the nomination of an arbitrator in cases falling under $$$ -sections and thereof?from what we understood the learned solicitor general appearing for the appellant and learned counsel appearing for the respondents are ad idem on this aspect. according to both of them the power of the chief justice or his nominee under section is restricted to the nomination of an arbitrator and the order that he makes is an administrative order.it therefore becomes necessary to

determine whether the order of the chief justice or his designate under section of the act is a judicial order or an administrative order it is necessary to take note of certain provisions of the act. section defines a court thus:"(e court means the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district and includes the high court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject -matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject -matter of a suit but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court or any court of small causes,". section read thus extent of judicial intervention -notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in matters governed by this part no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this part. section so far as is relevant reads thus:"( a judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall if a party so applies not later than when submitting his statement on the substance of the dispute refer the parties to arbitration. section states that the parties to an arbitration agreement are free to determine the number of arbitrators provided that such number shall not be an even number failing such determination the arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator. section reads thus appointment of arbitrators -a person of any nationality may be an arbitrator unless otherwise agreed by the parties.$$$ject to

arbitrator the obligation to disclose to the parties in writing any circumstances that may give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence and impartiality. an arbitrator can be challenged if there are circumstances that give rise to justifiable doubts about his independence and impartiality or if he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by the parties but such challenge can be made only for reasons which the party challenging becomes aware of after the appointment has been made. section speaks of the challenge procedure. it states that the parties are free to agree on such a procedure. failing that the party who makes the challenge must within days after becoming aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or of any of the circumstances mentid in section send a written statement of the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal. unless the challenged arbitrator withdraws or the other party to the arbitrations agrees to the challenge the arbitral tribunal shall decide upon the challenge and if the challenge is not successful it shall continue the arbitration proceedings and make an award. that award can be sought to be set aside under section. section empowers the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. clause of section is relevant and reads thus:"( the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement and for that purpose,-(a an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the validity of the arbitration clause. if a party is

interpretation.if any question arises with reference to the interpretation of any of the provisions of this $$$ the question shall be referred to the chief justice whose decision shall be final. power to amend the scheme.the chief justice may from time to time amend by way of addition or variation any provision of this scheme. the judge $$$ whose judgment is to be reconsidered framed the following questions for what is the nature of the order that is passed by the chief justice or his nominee in exercise of power under $$$ -section of section of the act?(2 even if the said order is held to be administrative in nature what is the remedy open to the person concerned if his request for appointment of an arbitrator is turned down by the learned chief justice or his nominee for some reason or other?"4. the judge $$$ noted that the act was based upon the uncitral model framed by the commission on international trade law established by the united nations. it said that if a comparison was made between the language of section of the act and $$$ of the model law it was apparent that the act had designated the chief justice of a high court in cases of domestic arbitration and the chief justice of india in cases of international commercial arbitration to be the authority to perform the function of appointment of an arbitrator whereas under the model law that power had been vested in the court. when the matter was placed before the chief justice or his designate under section it was imperative for the chief justice or his designate to bear in mind the legislative intent that the arbitral process should be set in motion without any delay and leave all contentious issues to be raised before the arbitral tribunal. at that stage it was not contentious issues between the parties and decide the same. a bare reading of section and made it clear that questions with regard to the qualifications independence and impartiality of the arbitrator and in respect of the jurisdiction of the arbitrator could be raised before the arbitrator who would decide the same. if a contingency arose where the chief justice or his designate refused to make an appointment the party seeking the appointment was not without remedy. an intervention was possible by a court in the same way as an intervention was possible against an administrative order of the executive. in other words it would be a case of non -performance of his duty by the chief justice or his designate and therefore a mandamus would lie. in such an event there would not be any inordinate delay in setting the arbitral process in motion. the nature and function performed by the chief justice or his designate being essentially to aid the constitution of the arbitral tribunal it could not be held to be a judicial function as otherwise the legislature would have used the expression court or judicial authority. it was therefore held that an order under section refusing to appoint an arbitrator was not amenable to the jurisdiction of this court under $$$ of the constitution. in the referring judgment the bench of learned judges noted the material relied upon by learned counsel for the appellant before them which related to the model law and learned counsel 's argument. it then stated in the light of the above contentions and material which in our opinion have a substantial bearing on the matter and further inasmuch as this question is arising almost constantly in a large number of cases in the various high courts it is desirable that this court re -examines the matter. it is convenient at this stage itself to deal with the argument based on the model law. the statement of objects and reasons of the act states though the said uncitral model law and $$$s are intended to deal with international commercial arbitration and conciliation they could with appropriate modifications serve as a model for legislation on domestic arbitration and conciliation. the present $$$ seeks to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration international commercial arbitration enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and to define the law relating to conciliation taking into account the said uncitral model law and $$$s. that the model law was only taken into account in the drafting of the said act is therefore patent. the act and the model law are not identically drafted. under section the appointment of an arbitrator in the event of a party to the arbitration agreement failing to carry out his obligation to appoint an arbitrator is to be made by the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him under clause of the model law it is to be made by a court. section of the act is altogether different from clause of the model law. the model law and judgments and literature thereon are therefore not a guide to the interpretation of the act and especially of section thereof. $$$ counsel for the appellants submitted that section of the act laid down conditions precedent to the chief justice or his designate naming an arbitrator in that as for example in sub -section 4)(a the party had to fail to appoint an arbitrator within days from the receipt of a request to do so from the other party. if the party who was alleged to have failed to appoint an arbitrator within days of the receipt of the request contested this position it was for the chief justice or his designate to decide the issue. reliance was placed upon sub -section of section which refers to a decision on the matter entrusted to the chief justice or his designate and on sub -section(8 which requires the chief justice or his designate to have due regard to the qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and other considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator. in learned counsel submission these also indicated that the chief justice or his designate had to perform an adjudicatory function in naming an arbitrator. $$$ counsel submitted that section of the act enabled the arbitral tribunal to decide on the width of its jurisdiction but it could not decide whether or into an arbitrator had no jurisdiction because he had been appointed by the chief justice or his designate even though the period of days of the receipt of the request to do so had not elapsed this was an issue which had to be decided by the chief justice or his designate. reliance was placed upon clause of the appointment of arbitrators by the chief justice of india scheme it was submitted that the affected parties had to be given notice by reason of that clause to show cause which implied that on their showing cause the issues they raised would be decided by the chief justice or his designate. reliance was placed upon associated cement companies ltd. v. p.n. sharma and anr. $$$ / sc/0/964$$$ / sc/0/964 to contend that the chief justice or his designate functid as a tribunal so as to attract $$$ to the order naming an arbitrator. it was submitted that the essential requirements in this behalf were satisfied namely the appointment of the chief justice was an appointment by the state the chief justice or his designate were independent of the executive there was a duty cast upon them to decide judicially and they had the power to enforce their decision. the learned attorney general on notice made submissions that were adopted by learned counsel for the respondents. the attorney general drew our attention to section of the act which mandated that no judicial authority should intervene except to the extent provided in the act and to section which required a judicial authority before which an action was brought in a matter which was the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration. the emphasis of the act in the learned attorney general 's submission was to expedite the proceedings of the domestic tribunal to which the parties had agreed to submit their disputes. it was in this light that the act had to be read. section did not require the chief justice or his designate to perform any adjudicatory function. all that the chief justice or his designate was required to do was to nominate an arbitrator if a party to an arbitration agreement had failed to do so within the specified time after a request to it to do so had been made and in so nominating an arbitrator the chief justice or his designate was to have regard to the qualifications that were required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and to other considerations which were likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator. this the chief justice or his designated had to do on an facie basis no element of adjudication came into it. the learned attorney general drew attention to section and which provided for a challenge to an arbitrator in respect of whom there were doubts about independence or impartiality. the provisions of section and applied even to an arbitrator who had been nominated by the chief justice or his designate under section. in the submission of the learned attorney general the competence of the arbitral tribunal to role on its own jurisdiction under section was not confined to the width of its jurisdiction but extended to deciding whether it had any jurisdiction at all. section gave a party adversely affected by an arbitral award the right to approach a court to set it aside on the stated grounds which included the composition of the arbitral tribunal. an order under section was appealable under section as was an order accepting the plea that the arbitral tribunal did not have jurisdiction. the learned attorney general drew our attention to the judgments of this court in the engineering mazdoor sabha representing workmen employed under the hind cycles ltd. and anr. v. the hind cycle ltd.bombay $$$ / sc/09/962$$$ / sc/09/962 supp. scr and jaswant sugar mills ltd.meerut v. lakshmichand and ors. $$$ / sc/0382/62$$$ / sc/0382/62 to submit that a tribunal was a body that exercised an adjudicatory function. the chief justice or his designate under section performed neither an adjudicatory function nor they were exercising the power of the state. they were not therefore tribunals and their orders under section could not be made the subject of petitions for leave to appeal under $$$. $$$ empowers this court to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment decree sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of india. for the nomination of an arbitrator by the chief justice or his designate under section of the act to be subject to $$$ such nomination must be a a judgment decree determination sentence or order passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of india. the question is whether such nomination is a determination or order and whether it is made by a tribunal as contended by learned counsel for the appellants. there is in the line of authority of this court on the subject a recurring theme. in the judgment cited by learned counsel for the appellants himself namely the case of associated cement companies ltd.a constitution bench said the question which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the state government is a tribunal when it exercises its authority under $$$ or $$$... the main and basic test however is whether the adjudicating power which a particular authority is empowered to exercise has been conferred on it by a statute and can be described as a part of the state 's inherent power exercised in discharging its judicial function. applying this test there can be no doubt that the power which the state government exercises under $$$ and $$$ is a part of the state 's judicial power. it has been conferred on the state government by a statutory rule and it can be exercised in respect of disputes between the management and its welfare officers. there is in that sense a lis there is affirmation by party and denial by another and the dispute necessarily involves the rights and obligations of the parties to it. in jaswant sugar mills ltd.cited by the learned attorney general this court said the expression determination in the context in which it occurs in $$$ signifies and effective expression of opinion which ends a controversy or a dispute by some authority to whom it is submitted under a valid law for disposal. the expression order must have also a similar meaning except that it need not operate to end the dispute. determination or order must be judicial or quasi -judicial purely administrative or executive direction is not contemplated to be made the subject -matter of appeal to this court. the essence of the authority of this court being judicial this court does not exercise administrative or executive powers i. character of the power conferred upon this court original or appellate by its constitution being judicial the determination or order sought to be appealed from must have the character of a judicial adjudication. the court went on to state that to make a decision or an act judicial the following criteria must be satisfied:"(1 it is in substance a determination upon investigation of a question by the application of objective standards to facts found in the light of pre -existing legal rule;(2 it declares rights or imposes upon parties obligations affecting their civil rights and(3 that the investigation is subject to certain procedural attributes contemplating an opportunity of presenting its case to a party ascertainment of facts by means of evidence if a sic be on questions of fact and if the dispute be on question of law on the presentation of legal argument and a decision resulting in the disposal of the matter on findings based upon those questions of law and fact. the court added but every decision or order by an authority under a duty to act judicially is not subject to appeal to this court. under $$$ an appeal lies to this court from adjudications of courts and tribunals only. adjudication of a court or a tribunal must doubtless be judicial but every authority which by its constitution or authority specially conferred upon it is required to act judicially is not necessary a tribunal for the purpose of $$$. in the case of the engineering mazdoor sabha a constitution bench said:"for invoking $$$ conditions must be satisfied. the proposed appeal must be from any judgment decree determination sentence or order that is to say it must not be against a purely executive or administrative order. if the determination or order giving rise to the appeal is a judicial or quasi -judicial determination or order the condition is satisfied. the condition imposed by the $$$ is that the said determination or order must have been made or passed by any court or tribunal in the territory of india. these conditions therefore require that the act complained against must have the character of a judicial or quasi -judicial act and the authority whose act is complained against must be a court or a tribunal. unless both the conditions are satisfied article can not be invoked.the court added..the tribunal which are contemplated by article are clothed with some of the powers of the courts. they can compel witnesses to appear they can administer oath they are required to follow certain rules of procedure the proceedings before them are required to comply with rules of natural justice they may not be bound by the strict and technical rules of evidence but nevertheless they must decide on evidence adduced before them they may not be bound by other technical rules of law but their decisions must nevertheless be consistent with the general principles of law. in other words they have to act judicially and reach their decisions in an objective manner and they can not proceed purely administratively or base their conclusions on subjective tests or inclinations... to put it concisely for an order properly to be the subject of a petition for special leave to appeal under article it must be an adjudicatory order an order that adjudicates upon the rival contentions of parties and it must be passed by an authority constituted by the state by law for the purpose in discharge of the state 's obligation to secure justice to its people. section of the act deals with the appointment of arbitrators. it provides that the parties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators. in the event of there being no agreement in regard to such procedure in an arbitration by arbitrators each party is required to appoint arbitrator and the arbitrators so appointed must appoint the arbitrator. if a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within days from the request to do so by the other party or the arbitrators appointed by the parties fail to agree on a arbitrator within days of their appointment a party may request the chief justice to nominate an arbitrator and the nomination shall be made by the chief justice or any person or institution designated by him. if the parties have not agreed on a procedure for appointing an arbitrator in an arbitration with a sole arbitrator and the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator within days from receipt of a request to party by the other party the nomination shall be made on the request of a party by the chief justice or his designate. where an appointment procedure has been agreed upon by the parties but a party fails to act as required by that procedure or the parties or the arbitrators appointed by them fail to reach the agreement expected of them under that procedure or a person or institution fails to perform the function entrusted to him or it under that procedure a party may request the chief justice or his designate to nominate an arbitrator unless the appointment procedure provides other means in this behalf. the decision of the chief justice or his designate is final. in nominating an arbitrator the chief justice or his designate must have regard to the qualifications required of the arbitrator in the agreement between the parties and to other considerations that will secure the nomination of an independent and impartial arbitrator. there is nothing in section that requires the party other than the party making the request to be noticed. it does not contemplate a response from that other party. it does not contemplate a decision by the chief justice or his designate on any controversy that the other party may raise even in regard to its failure to appoint an arbitrator within the period of days. that the chief justice or his designate has to make the nomination of an arbitrator only if the period of days is over does not lead to the conclusion that the decision to nominate is adjudicatory. in its request to the chief justice to make the appointment the party would aver that this period has passed and ordinarily correspondence between the parties would be annexed to bear this out. this is all that the chief justice or his designate has to see. that the chief justice or his designate has to take into account the qualifications required of the arbitrator by the agreement between the parties which ordinarily would also be annexed to the request and other considerations likely to secure the nomination of an independent and impartial arbitrator also can not lead to the conclusion that the chief justice or his designate is required to perform an adjudicatory function. that the word decision is used in the matter of the request by a party to nominate an arbitrator does not of itself means that an adjudicatory decision is contemplated. as we see it the only function of the chief justice or his designate under section is to fill the gap left by a party to the arbitration agreement or by the arbitrators appointed by the parties and nominate an arbitrator. this is to enable the arbitral tribunal to be expeditiously constituted and the arbitration proceedings to commence. the function has been left to the chief justice or his designate advisedly with a view to ensure that the nomination of the arbitrator is made by a person occupying high judicial office or his designate who would take due care to see that a competent independent and impartial arbitrator is nominated. it might be that through the chief justice or his designate might have taken all due care to nominate an independent and impartial arbitrator a party in a given case may have justifiable doubts about that arbitrator 's independent or impartiality. in that event it would be open to that party to challenge the arbitrator under section adopting the procedure under section. there is no reason whatever to conclude that the grounds for challenge under section are not available only because the arbitrator has been nominated by the chief justice or his designate under section. it might also be that in a given case the chief justice or his designate may have nominated an arbitrator although the period of days had not expired. if so the arbitral tribunal would have been improperly constituted and be without jurisdiction. it would then be open to the aggrieved party to require the arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction. section provides for this. it states that the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction. that the arbitral tribunal may rule on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement shows that the arbitral tribunal 's authority under section is not confined to the width of its jurisdiction as was submitted by learned counsel for the appellants but goes to the very root of its jurisdiction. there would therefore be no impediment in contending before the arbitral tribunal that it had been wrongly constituted by reason of the fact that the chief justice or his designate had nominated an arbitrator although the period of days had not expired and that therefore it had no jurisdiction. the schemes made by the chief justice under section can not govern the interpretation of section. if the schemes as drawn go beyond the terms of section they are bad and have to be amended. to the extent that the appointment of arbitrators by the chief justice of india scheme goes beyond section by requiring in clause the service of a notice upon the other party to the arbitration agreement to show cause why the nomination of an arbitrator as requested should not be made it is bad and must be amended. the other party needs to be given notice of the request only so that it may know of it and it may if it so chooses assist the chief justice or his designate in the nomination of an arbitrator. in conclusion we hold that the order of the chief justice or his designate under section nominating an arbitrator is not an adjudicatory order and the chief justice or his designate is not a tribunal. such an order can not properly be made the subject of a petition for special leave to appeal under article. the decision of the judge bench in konkan railway corporation ltd. and ors. v. mehul construction co. is affirmed. we record our appreciation of the assistance rendered by the learned attorney general as amicus curiae. in the result the appeals are dismissed. no order as to costs.
