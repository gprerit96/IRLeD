m.b. shah j. in the background of facts briefly stated below questions for determination in these appeals are--. in an election petition under the representation of the people act hereinafter referred to as the act when contest for election to the post of mla is by more than candidates for seat and a candidate who was disqualified to contest the election is elected -whether the $$$ can declare a candidate who has secured next higher votes as elected and. whether contract between the elected candidate and the government was subsisting on the date of scrutiny of nomination. $$$ contested election from no. bhalki constituency of karnataka state legislative assembly and was declared elected. respondent no. dr. $$$ contested the said election but was defeated. the details of the votes secured by each candidate are as follows:-. respondent no. challenged the said election by filing election petition no. and contended that declaration of election dated.resulting in favour of the appellant was illegal and void. he prayed that he may be declared as duly elected to karnataka state legislative assembly on the ground that under section of the act appellant was disqualified to contest the election as there were subsisting contracts entered into by him in the course of his business with the state government. further a voter mr. $$$. $$$ -appellant in c.a. no. of also filed election petition no. for a declaration that election of mr. prakash $$$ was void under section and section of the act. $$$ also filed recrimination petition under section of the act praying that in the event of his election to the constituency being declared void respondent no. dr. $$$ should not be declared as elected as he is guilty of corrupt practices as specified in section of the act. the high $$$ of karnataka at bangalore mr. justice a.v. srinivasa $$$ by its judgment and order dated.allowed the election petition filed by respondent no. and the election of appellant was declared void under section on the ground that work of effective improvement and asphalting of halburga bawgi -kamtana road was continued to be carried out by prakash $$$ even after purported closure of contract. with regard to the rest of the contract works the high $$$ held that contracts were terminated. the $$$ also declared that the votes polled by the elected candidate would become wasted and therefore dr. vijay kumar $$$ who has secured the next highest number of valid votes has to be declared elected under section of the act and was declared accordingly. that order is challenged by prakash $$$ by filing civil appeal no. -of. civil appeal no. of is filed by $$$. $$$. at the time of admission of this matter by order dated.the $$$ granted interim relief as under:--"appeals admit.the impugned judgment is stayed thereby entitling the appellant only to attend the assembly sessions and sign the register but he will neither participate in the proceedings nor vote nor draw remuneration in his capacity as member of the legislature assembly till the disposal of the appeals. any further documents to be filed by either party be filed within weeks from $$$$.these appeals may be listed for final disposal in the week of march.on the other respondents dasti notice is permitted.re question no. at the time of hearing of these appeals learned senior counsel mr. $$$ submitted that the order passed by the high $$$ declaring election -petitir dr. $$$ as elected is on the face of it illegal and errous as election was contested by candidates and in support of his submission he referred to various decisions rendered by this $$$. as against this mr. k.n. bhat learned senior counsel for respondent no. submitted that the high $$$ rightly declared dr. $$$ as elected and the decision of the high $$$ is based on the provisions of section of the act. for appreciating the aforesaid submissions we would refer to the relevant provisions of the act namely sections and of the act which are as under:--". procedure in contested and uncontested elections.-if the number of contesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled a poll shall be taken.if the number of such candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled the returning officer shall forthwith declare all such candidates to be duly elected to fill those seats.if the number of such candidates is less than the number of seats to be filled the returning officer shall forthwith declare all such candidates to be elected and the election commission shall by notification in the official gazette call upon the constituency or the elected members or the members of the state legislative assembly or the members of the electoral college concerned as the case may be to elect a person or persons to fill the remaining seat or seats.provided that where the constituency or the elected members or the members of the state legislative assembly or the members of the electoral college having already been called upon under this sub -section has or have failed to elect a person or he requisite number of persons as the case may be to till the vacancy or vacancies the election commission shall not be bound to call again upon the constituency or such members to elect a person or persons until it is satisfied that if called upon again there will be no such failure on the part of the constituency of such members. relief that may be claimed by the petitir.-a petitir may in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void claim a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. grounds for which a candidate other than the returned candidate may be declared to have been elected.-if any person who has lodged a petition has in addition to calling in question the election of the returned candidate claimed a declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected and the high $$$ is of that in fact the petitir or such other candidate received a majority of the valid votes that but for the votes obtained by the returned candidate by corrupt practices the petitir or such other candidate would have obtained a majority of the valid votes.the high $$$ shall after declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void declare the petitir or such other candidate as the case may be to have been duly elected. from a reading of sub -section of section it is clear that if number of candidates is equal to number of seats to be filled the returning officer has to declare all such candidates to be duly elected to fill those seats meaning thereby it would be uncontested election. further if the number of contesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled a poll is required to be taken. finally after taking poll if candidate is declared elected and there are only candidates who contested for the election and if it is found that elected candidate was disqualified for or other reason for being declared to be elected then his election would be set aside and unsuccessful candidate if otherwise eligible could be declared as elected and that relief could be granted in view of section read with section of the act. however the question which requires consideration is if there are more than candidates for seat and the elected candidate is subsequently found to be disqualified whether the candidate who has secured more votes than remaining candidates should be declared as elected or not for this we would consider the ingredients of section which inter alia provide that after declaring election of returned candidate to be void the high $$$ may declare the petitir or such other candidate to have been duly elected if--(a in fact the petitir or such other candidate received a majority of valid votes but for the votes obtained by the returned candidate by the corrupt practices the petitir or such other candidate would have obtained a majority of the valid votes. therefore the ingredient for declaring the election -petitir or other candidate to have been duly elected depends upon error for various reasons in counting of valid votes and if it is found that in fact the petitir or such other candidate received a majority of valid votes he is to be declared elected. second ingredient provides for establishing that the votes obtained by the returned candidate were obtained by corrupt practices and but for such votes the petitir or such other candidate would have obtained a majority of valid votes. say as in the present case the difference between the elected candidate and the election petitir is of votes and if it is established that elected candidate obtained more than votes by corrupt practices then petitir or such other candidate who has obtained majority of valid votes could be declared as elected. however in an election where elected candidate is declared to be disqualified to contest election and there are more than candidates contesting election there is no specific provision under the act under which the person who has secured the next higher number of votes could be declared as elected. the act is silent on this point. further it can not be presumed that the votes secured by the disqualified elected candidates would have been wasted or would have been secured by the next candidate who has secured more votes. if disqualified candidate was not permitted to contest the election then how the voters would have voted in favour of the candidate who has secured more votes than other remaining candidates would be a question in the realm of speculation and unpredictability in such a situation declaring the election of the returned candidate on the ground of his initial disqualification to contest the election by itself would not entitle the election petitir or any other candidate to be declared elected. the learned counsel for the parties referred to various decisions rendered by this $$$ and we would refer them in chronological order. the constitution bench of this $$$ in konappa rudrappa $$$ v. vishwanath $$$ and anr. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ dealt with the case where vishwanath $$$ was declared elected to mysore legislative assembly and that election was challenged by $$$ who was a contesting candidate on the ground that $$$ was disqualified from standing as a candidate for election. this $$$ by order dated th july held that election of $$$ was void and that votes cast in his favour be treated as thrown away. the $$$ held as there was no other contesting candidate we declare the appellant election petitir as elected to the seat from the yadgiri constituency.that order was challenged by filing a review application which was granted and question whether it was open to the $$$ on finding recorded about disqualification of reddy to declare $$$ as duly elected to the mysore legislative assembly was dealt with and decided. the $$$ referred to earlier decision in keshav laxman borkar v. dr. devrao laxman $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ wherein it was held that a candidate whose nomination paper is accepted after scrutiny is a validity nominated candidate at least for the purpose of receiving votes at the election and that the candidate must be treated as a person for whom votes could be given. the $$$ on that view held that where there are only candidates for a seat and the election of the candidate declared elected is set aside on the ground that he was disqualified the defeated candidate can not be declared elected and there must be afresh election. in the opinion of the $$$ the votes cast in favour of the disqualified candidate can not be said to be thrown away unless there is a special pleading that certain voters had cast their votes with the knowledge or notice that the candidate for whom they had voted was not eligible for election and they had deliberately thrown away their votes in favour of the disqualified person in the absence of such a plea it can not be said that the votes cast in favour of a person who was by law disqualified from being nominated but who was in fact nominated were thrown away. in the opinion of the court a defeated candidate out of the contested the election may be declared elected under section read with section of the act if he proves that the voters had notice of the disqualification of the successful candidate. the correctness of the said view was challenged before the constitution bench. the $$$ considered various english decisions cited at the bar and observed that the case decided by the $$$s in the united kingdom appear to have proceeded upon some general rule of election law that the votes cast in favour of a person who is found disqualified for election may be regarded as thrown away only if the voters had notice before the poll of the disqualification of the candidate. $$$ the $$$ pertinently observed but in our judgment the rule which has prevailed in the british $$$s for a long time has no application in our country. the rule enunciated in u.k. has only the merit of antiquity the rule can not be extended to the trial of disputes under our election law for it is not consistent with our statute law and in any case the conditions prevailing in our country do not justify the application of that rule. the $$$ also considered section of the act and held that it renders a poll necessary only if there are more candidates contesting the election than the number of seats contested and if the number of candidates validly nominated is equal to the seats to be filled no poll is necessary and where by an errous order of the returning officer poll is held which but for that order was not necessary the $$$ would be justified in declaring those contesting candidates elected who but for the order would have been declared elected. $$$ the $$$ observed thus--.. when there are only contesting candidates and of them is under a statutory disqualification votes cast in favour of the disqualified candidate may be regarded as thrown away irrespective of whether the voters who voted for him were aware of the disqualification. this is not to say that where there are more than candidates in the field for a single seat and al is disqualified on proof of disqualification all the votes cast in his favour will be discarded and the candidate securing the next highest number of votes will be declared elected. in such a case question of notice to the voters may assume significance for the voters may not if aware of the disqualification have voted for the disqualified candidate.the $$$ also considered section and held as under... the votes obtained by corrupt practice by the returned candidate proved to be guilty of corrupt practice are expressly excluded in the computation of total votes for ascertaining whether a majority of votes had been obtained by the defeated candidate and no fresh poll is necessary. the same rule should in our judgment apply when at an election there are only candidates and the returned candidate is found to be under a statutory disqualification existing at the date of the filing of the nomination paper. in thiru $$$ and anr. v. returning officer and ors. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/ the $$$ dealt with the biennial election to $$$ from the state of tamil nadu where the voting pattern is single -transferable vote wherein the elected candidate $$$ was found by the $$$ to be statutorily disqualified for election. the $$$ considered the question whether the votes secured by such candidate be regarded as thrown away and in consequence the next candidate be declared elected in that context the $$$ observed:-"again the answer to this question in our opinion must be in the negative. it is nobody 's case that the electors who voted for $$$ had at the time of election knowledge or notice of the statutory disqualification of this candidate. on the contrary they must have been under the impression that $$$ was a candidate whose nomination had been validly accepted by the returning officer. had the electors notice of $$$ 's disqualification how many of them would have voted for him and how many for the other continuing candidates including $$$ subramanyan and $$$ and in what preferential order remains a question in the realm of speculation and unpredictability. the $$$ also referred to the following observations made by $$$ c.j. speaking for the $$$ in r.m. seshadri v. g. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ rejecting similar contention:-"this question will depend on our reaching the conclusion that but for the fact that voters were brought through this corrupt practice to the polling booths the result of the election had been materially affected. in a single transferable vote it is very difficult to say how the voting would have g because if all the votes which seshadri had got had g to of the other candidates who got eliminated at the earlier counts those candidates would have won. we can not order a recount because those voters were not free from complicity. it would be speculating to decide how many of the voters were brought to the polling booths in car. we think that we are not in a position to declare $$$ as elected because that would be merely a guess or surmise as to the nature of the voting which would have taken place if this corrupt practice had not been perpetrated.and thereafter the $$$ held as under:"the position in the instant case is not better. it is extremely difficult if not impossible to predicate what the voting pattern would have been if the electors knew at the time of election that $$$ was not qualified to contest the election. in any case shri subramanyan was neither the sole continuing candidate nor had be secured the requisite quota of votes. he can not therefore be declared elected:"0. the $$$ also considered the dictum in the case of viswanath supra and observed that the ratio decidendi of said case is applicable only where a there are contesting candidates and of them is disqualified and the election is on the basis of single non -transferable vote. again in lata devi mali v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/ this $$$ dealt with the same question and observed as under:-... it is to be noted that in an election petition what is called in question is the election and what is claimed is that the election of all or any of the returned candidate is void with or without a further declaration that the election petitir himself or any other candidate had been duly elected. declaring the election of the returned candidate void does not by itself entitle the election petitir or any other candidate to be declared elected. $$$ counsel for the appellant lastly referred to the decision in d.k. sharma v. ram sharan yadav and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ airsc. in that case the high court referred to the decision in $$$ supra and held that on the basis of the oral evidence it was not possible to hold that the voters who cast their votes in favour of the elected candidate did so after having noticed about the disqualification and knowing that their votes would be wasted and therefore the prayer of the election petitir to declare him as duly elected after throwing away the votes of elected candidate was not allowed. this court did not find any infirmity in the said reasoning and therefore dismissed the appeal. in view of the aforesaid settled legal position in our view the impugned order passed by the high court declaring the election petitir as elected on the ground that the votes cast in favour of elected candidate appellant are thrown away was totally errous and can not be justified. as held by the constitution bench in konappa 's case that some general rule of election law prevailing in the united kingdom that the votes cast in favour of a person who is found disqualified for election may be regarded as thrown away only if the votes had noticed before the poll the disqualification of the candidate has no application in our country and has only merit of antiquity. we found observe that the question of sending such notice to all voters appears to as alien to the act and the $$$s. but that question is not required to be dealt with in this matter. as stated earlier in the present case for seat there were candidates and it would be impossible to predict or guess in whose favour the voters would have voted if they were aware that elected candidate was disqualified to contest election or if he was not permitted to contest the election by rejecting his nomination paper on the ground of disqualification to contest the election and what would have been voting pattern. therefore order passed by the high court declaring the election petitir -dr. $$$ as elected requires to be set aside.re question no.whether contract between the government and $$$ was subsisting on the date of scrutiny of nomination papers?finding given by the high court:. on this question we would refer to the finding given by the high court. the learned judge held that out of contracts between appellant and the state government contracts were terminated. but from the evidence on record he held that the work of effective improvement and asphalting of halburga bawgi -kamtana road was continued to be carried out by prakash $$$ even after the purported closure of contract that is subsequent to the writing of the letters and therefore as a matter of fact there was subsistence of contract between him and pwd. for this purpose the learned judge relied upon $$$.wherein the name of the contractor appeared to be mr. prakash $$$ and the likely date of completion was shown as december. he has also placed reliance upon $$$. which is a measurement book pertaining to $$$ works and held that if these works were carried out by $$$ after.the entries under various columns could not have born the details of the contract as entered into by prakash $$$ and the name of the contractor would also have been mentid as $$$ $$$. he held that except letters and agreements $$$. and there was nothing on record to show that the department closed the contract of mr. prakash $$$. he further referred to the evidence of $$$ and held that earnest my deposit was not given by him to the authority. he therefore held that the department as well as $$$ did not actually treat the work allotted to $$$ as a fresh contract and there appeared to be mere substitution of $$$ in place of prakash $$$. with regard to the rest of the contract works he arrived at the conclusion that the contracts were not subsisting. he finally arrived at the conclusion that election of mr. prakash $$$ was void under section of the act as he was disqualified under section of the act on the date of scrutiny of nomination papers on the date of election and on the date of declaration of result and it was declared as such on that count.submissions:. $$$ senior counsel mr. $$$ for the appellant submitted that once the contract is terminated by writing various letters by the appellant and when such termination is accepted by the department it inevitably means that contract does not subsist. further the moment registration of the contractor is cancelled and no dues certificate is issued it would mean that contracts were terminated. the government cancelled registration of prakash $$$ as $$$ -i contractor on.and issued no dues certificate. it is his submission that appellant has unequivocally terminated the contracts and that is accepted by all witnesses from the public works department examined by the election petitir. therefore there was no reason for the learned judge to hold that halbarga -bawagi contract works continued. it is his submission that prior to termination of the contract % of the work was over and % of the work remained to be completed but the appellant was required to terminate the contract as elections for the legislative assembly were prepd. for this purpose he referred to the cost of the actual contract work as per the tender which was for a sum of rs. he pointed out that out of that he has completed the work of rs. for the work d by him prior to termination of the contract he had received rs. and had recovered remaining amount by installments in $$$$s of september / october / $$$$ and december but that does not mean that appellant has carried out further contract work. he pointed out that whatever amount he had received after termination of the contract was for the work d by him prior to termination of the contract. $$$ senior counsel mr. shanti bhushan appearing for the election petitir submitted that the finding of the high court that the contracts between the appellant and the state government were subsisting is based upon appreciation of evidence and the said appreciation can not be said to be in any way errous. it is his contention that contracts were not terminated and the appellant continued the contract work through his brother as benamidar. he submitted that from evidence on record it is proved that the contracts were subsisting. it is his further contention that mere cancellation of registration would not be sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that contract was terminated. he heavily relied upon certain $$$hibits and submitted that there was tampering of evidence by the department in favour of the appellant. it is his say that transfer of work in favour of $$$ was as such benami.statutory provision:. before dealing with the facts we would refer to relevant statutory provision. under the act disqualification on the ground of subsistence of contract was provided under section which reads as under--". a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of either house of parliament or of the legislative assembly or legislative counsel of a state.if whether by himself or by any person or body of persons in trust for him or for his benefit or on his account he has any share of interest in a contract for the supply of goods to or for the execution of any works or the performance of any services undertaken by the appropriate government.$$$ it was amended by act of which read thus:-". a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of either house of parliament or of the legislative assembly or legislative council of a state...if there subsists a contract entered into in the course of his trade or business by him with the appropriate government for the supply of goods to of for the execution of any works undertaken by that government. the aforesaid section was replaced by section by act of which came into force from th december. it reads. disqualification for government contracts etc.person shall be disqualified if and for so long as there subsists a contract entered into by him in the course of his trade or business with the appropriate government for the supply of goods to or for the execution of any works undertaken by that government.$$$planation.the purposes of this section where a contract has been fully performed by the person by whom it has been entered into with the appropriate government the contract shall be deemed not to subsist by reason only of the fact that the government has not performed its part of the contract either wholly or in part. the objects and reasons for substituting section by section are as under:--"apart from the grouping of the sections effected by clause some changes have also been made in the relevant provisions. in the new section an $$$planation has been added to make it clear that a contract with the government shall be deemed not to subsist by reason only of the fact that the government has not performed its part of the contract either wholly or in part. this change has become necessary in order to do away with the disqualification that attaches to a person for being chosen as or for being a member of parliament or state legislature even after he has fully performed his part of the contract since it would hardly be justifiable to retain such a disqualification provision in a modern welfare state when state activities extend almost over every domain of the citizen 's affairs where very many persons in way or the other have contractual relationship with the government. that being the case an unduly strict view about government contract in $$$$ might lead to the disqualification of a large number of citizens many of whom may prove to be able and capable members of parliament or state legislatures. it would be of interest to note in this connection that in the united kingdom any disqualification arising out of any contract with the crown has been d away with by the house of commons disqualifications act. from the afore -quoted objects and reasons of substituting section it is clear that unduly strict view about the government contract in $$$$ is not required to be taken and the change became necessary in order to do away with the disqualification that attach to a person for being chosen as or for being member of the parliament or state legislature even after he has fully performed his part of the contract. further initially section was very wide. a person having any share or interest in contract or such person having interest by any person in trust for him or for his benefit or on his own account was disqualified to contest election. this disqualification was narrowed down in. $$$ in section was substituted which provides that the person shall be disqualified--(a if and for so long as there subsists a contract by him in course of his trade or business;(b for the supply of goods to or(c for the execution of any work undertaken by him. $$$planation further provides that where the contract has been fully performed by the person by whom it has been entered into the contract shall be deemed not to subsist by reason only of the fact that government has not performed its part of the contract either wholly or in part. this explanation is added to clarify that mere non performance on the part of the government say non payment of my would not be deemed to mean that contract subsists even though the contract has been fully performed by such person. in ranjeet singh v. harmohinder $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ this court in para observed thus:--"section is a statutory provision which imposes a disqualification on a citizen. it would therefore be unreasonable to take a general or broad view ignoring the essentials of the section and the intention of the legislature. purposive interpretation is necessary. in $$$ v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/ section of the act has been correctly interpreted in the following words:-"an analysis of section of the act shows that only in cases a person would be disqualified if he has entered into a contract with the appropriate government in the course of his trade or business which is subsisting on the date of scrutiny of nomination. they are when the contract is for supply of goods to the appropriate government and where the contract is for the execution of any works undertaken by that government.correspondence for termination of contract:-. in the light of the aforesaid statutory provision to find out whether contract was subsisting on the date of filing of nomination we would refer to the letters written by the appellant to the department for terminating the contracts and the action taken by the department on the basis of the said letters.copy

after obtaining the opinion of the government pleader regarding premature termination of the contracts. pw chief $$$ carried out inspection on.because of the closure of work by the appellant. he

last measurement with regard to the work executed by prakash $$$ was taken on.as stated by $$$. pw chief $$$ has also stated that he had permitted the transfer of work from appellant to his brother $$$ after verifying $$$ and that he had ordered transfer of contract work after.. the work was entrusted to $$$ on the recommendation of superintending $$$ing pw. it is also stated that contracts come to an end when the registration of contractorship is cancelled. pw $$$ecutive $$$ denied the suggestion that even though the contract was transferred in the name of $$$ the same was carried out benami by the appellant. from the evidence and the correspondence produced between the appellant and the department it is crystal clear that the appellant terminated the subsisting contracts and the departmental accepted it. hence contracts were brought to an end by the parties. department also permitted the remaining works to be carried out by $$$. in this view of the matter the finding given by the high court that work of effective improvement and asphalting of halburga -bawgi kamtana road continued and therefore contract was subsisting is errous. the question whether the contracts were subsisting or not is always a question of fact to be determined from the evidence on record still however we would refer to the relevant case law cited at the bar. in s. munishamappa v. b. venkatarayappa and ors. $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ airsc the court considered letter written by a candidate who was elected wherein he stated that i can not contest the elections to $$$ therefore i request you to immediately cancel the work licence registered under you in my name. i request you to finalise all works pending in my name and cancel my licence immediately.that was processed by the department and it was endorsed please finalise the claims of the contractor for the above works. a further endorsement was made directing the bills of the contractor to be submitted immediately. the high court arrived at the conclusion that on the relevant date the contract was subsisting and therefore he was disqualified for contesting the election in view of section of the act. this court considered the submission that contract can come to an end by parties by express agreement under the doctrine of frustration and by breach and after considering the letter $$$.the court held thus:-"the appellant makes it manifestly clear that he intended to contest the election and to enable him to do so he wanted to have the licence in his favour cancelled immediately and to have his bills settled. the said letter clearly proceeds on the basis that at that point of time there was no existing contract between him and the government and he was only asking for a settlement of his bills and for cancellation of the licence. the endorsements made on the said letters by the authorities also go to indicate that the said position is accepted by them and necessary directions for finalisation of the bills are given"5. with regard to the breach of contract the court further observed as under:-"even if it be held that the appellant had committed a breach of the contract the contract can not be said to be subsisting thereafter. if the contract is discharged by breach on the part of the appellant the entire contract necessarily goes and along with this the agreement if there be any with regard to the maintenance must necessarily go leaving the party aggrieved to take steps to recover damages for such breach. the contract however can not be said be subsisting.. the fact that the bills of the appellant were settled at a later date and that the security deposit was refunded later on will not disqualify the appellant in view of the explanation to section of the act. the court negatived the contention that if any contractor is permitted to put an end to a contract by committing breaches thereof to enable him to contest the election will frustrate the very purpose of section of the act by holding that whether a contract subsist or not has to be determined in the light of the provisions of law relating to contract and the interpretation can not be in any way different while considering the provisions contained in section of the representation of the people act. similarly in smt. aslhing @ lhingjanong v. l.s. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/00/3$$$ / sc/00/3 the court considered the letter written by the contractor to the concerned executive $$$ing stating that he was closing his contract to be sufficient for holding that the contract was no longer subsisting as the contractor unilaterally put an end to the contract and informed the department concerned accordingly and he had also resigned from the contractor 's list of pwd. the court negatived the contention that unless the letter was accepted by the authority the contract would continue and the contractor would suffer from disqualification by holding that acceptance of the letter by the authorities was unnecessary for putting an end to the contract although the breach may give rise to a cause of action for damages. mr. shanti bhushan learned senior counsel heavily relied upon the affidavit dated.sworn by appellant prakash $$$. that affidavit was sent along with a letter written by $$$ who was the substitute contractor for the appellant to the executive $$$ stating that he was willing to execute all the balance works entrusted to $$$ on his quoted rates as per agreement and to complete them in all respect. in the said letter it was further stated that he was prepared to pay any dues outstanding against shri prakash $$$. along with letter there is an affidavit of prakash $$$ stating that in view of the pre -pavement of the assembly election he could not complete the work and therefore he had submitted application to terminate subsisting contracts between him and the government of karnataka. for the remaining work in his place sri $$$ class -i $$$ has agreed to execute the same on the same rate terms and conditions. we would quote paragraph of the said affidavit as heavy reliance is placed by the learned senior counsel for contending that it would establish that contract subsisted or there was novatio.para. i hereby declare in case sri $$$ class -i $$$ person fails to execute the work i will take the full responsibilities of getting it compared on the same rate and terms and conditions. firstly from the aforesaid affidavit it can be stated that the appellant had terminated the contract and that there was no question of subsisting contract. further statement made in the affidavit only indicates that if $$$ fails to execute the work election petitir will take the full responsibility of getting it completed on the same rate terms and conditions. but the said statement would not mean that any new contract for getting the works to be carried out was executed between the appellant and the state government. $$$ senior counsel also relied upon the decision in $$$ v. vishwanath reddy and anr. $$$ / sc/050/96$$$ / sc/050/96 and submitted that in the present case also there is condition to repair the work for a period of year even after completion of the contract work. it is his further submission that in view of the paragraph of the affidavit appellant agreed to take over the responsibility of completing the work if $$$ failed to execute the same and therefore there was a fresh contract between the appellant and the department. in the aforesaid case the court referred to $$$ v. moreshwar parasharam and ors. $$$ / sc/009/95$$$ / sc/009/95 wherein a contention was raised that no longer any contract for supply of goods was in existence but only an obligation arising under a guarantee clause subsisted and therefore it can not be held that contract was subsisting. the court negatived the said contention by holding thus:"it was argued that assuming that to be the case then there were no longer any contracts for the supply of goods in existence but only an obligation arising under the guarantee clause. we are unable to accept such a narrow construction. this term of the contract whatever the parties may have chosen to call it was a term in a contract for the supply of goods. when a contract consists of a number of terms and condition each condition does not form a separate contract but is an item in the contract of which it is a part. the consideration for each condition in a case like this is the consideration for the contract taken as a whole. it is not split up into several considerations apportid between each term separately. but quite apart from that the obligation even under this term was to supply fresh stocks for these depots in exchange for the stocks which were returned and so even when regarded from that narrow angle it would be a contract for the supply of goods. it is true they are replacements but a contract to replace goods is still for the supply of the goods which are sent as replacements.the court thereafter held that applying these observations in the context of construction of building and roads it is obvious that if some part of the work is found defective and has to be re -d the contract of execution as such is still to be fully performed. this term of contract is part of the contract of the execution because no execution can be said to be proper or complete till it is property executed. in such circumstances the court held that the contract would subsist and therefore disqualification provided under section would apply. in our view the aforesaid decision would have sic)ing to the facts of the present case. the case dealt with a situation where contract work was over but the time period as stipulated in the contract for carrying out the repairs was not over. therefore it can not be said that the contract was fully performed and hence it was subsisting. in the present case there is termination of all contracts by the appellant. the department accepted such termination and the contracts were brought to an end by both the parties. therefore there is no question of contract or any part thereof subsisting on the date of security of the nomination. this has been made clear in the letter written by the appellant on $$$$ to the chief $$$ by stating that his registration as class contractor with the department be cancelled thereby putting an end to any sort of subsisting contractual relationship between him and the government. presuming that according to the terms of the contract if some part of the contract work is found to be defective or is not properly executed and the contractor was bound to perform the same during a period of year after completion of the contract then also as contracts stood terminated said term of the contract of repairing for a period of year of curing the defect would also not subsist. $$$ senior counsel mr. shanti bhushan submitted that the contract work which was given to the brother of the appellant was as a matter of fact performed on behalf of the appellant by mr. $$$ his brother and therefore the high court rightly held that contract was subsisting on the date of security of the nomination paper. in our view this submission is without any substance mainly because after termination of the contract fresh contract is executed by $$$ for carrying out remaining work. further section as it stood prior to its amendment in inter alia provided if the work is carried out by himself or for any person or body of person in trust for him or for his benefit or on his account then such person was disqualified and in such situation the question of binomial or carrying out on behalf of appellant might require some consideration. after substitution of section by section there must be subsisting contrast by the contesting candidate for execution of any works undertaken by him with the government. the essential ingredient of the section is that the contract for the execution of any works undertaken by the government should be subsisting on the date of scrutiny of nomination. it is to be stated that because $$$ is brother of the contractor it can not be said that he was acting as a benamidar as he himself was registered class -i contractor. further as stated above the objects and reasons of section provides that an unduly strict view about the government contract should not be taken as it might lead to disqualification of large number of citizens many of whom may prove to be able or capable members of parliament or state legislatures. therefore the amended section 9-a uses the phrase the a person shall be disqualified so long as there subsist a contract. similarly subsequent payment by the government for the work d which was payable at the time of termination of contract would not mean that contract between the parties was subsisting and explanation to section has made the position clear. $$$ counsel further referred to ex.which is a measurement book and submitted that in the months of september october november and december also the name of contractor prakash $$$ continued and therefore it can not be held that contract was terminated. in our view as stated above all contracts with the appellants stood terminated on 6th august. $$$ 's registration was cancelled. no dues certificate was also given. fresh contracts with the firm of brother of appellant $$$ were executed. $$$ himself was a class -i contractor. in these set of circumstances it would be totally unreasonable and unjustifiable to refer to some errors committed by some officers as admitted by the witnesses in mentioning the name of prakash $$$ as contractor in the measurement book to arrive at the conclusion that contract between appellant and the government was subsisting. further as per letter dated.the executive $$$ directed the assistant executive $$$ that the closing measurement of the work executed be recorded and the same may be intimated to the office. the work included halbarga -bawgin road to kamthane road. $$$ counsel next referred to the codal rule and contended that contract work should not have been given to $$$ and the department was required to follow the procedure prescribed thereunder. codal rule reads as under:-". contracts for works estimated to cost rs. and over mentid in sub -para infra should be prepared only on regular contract form no. pwg and should be invited by public tenders.sanctid works falling under the following categories may be got executed on piece -work system at rates not exceeding the current minimum schedule of rates each case being however reported to government.works for which there have been no response from any of the contracts to the notification calling for tenders.works for which only individual tenders are received and which can not be accepted in view of the prohibitively high rates quoted which will not bear any comparison with the sanctid estimates rates or the current schedule of rates. in the case of tendered contractors who stop away in the middle action should be immediately taken to cancel their contract strictly enforcing the penal clause of the contract the balance of work being got d as above or as per terms of contract. in any case either the same tendered contractor or his agents should not be given the balance work for execution. in our view the election petitir could not challenge the acceptance or termination of contract and grant of contract to $$$ by the department by resorting to certain departmental procedure prescribed for grant of contract to other contractor. in any case not following the procedure prescribed under the rules would hardly be a ground for holding that the contract was subsisting. pw9 chief $$$ north z has specifically stated that he had verified the codal rules and that he was competent to grant permission of transfer of work from contractor to another under special circumstances and that similar procedure was adopted before general elections during. hence presuming that he has wrongly interpreted codal rule then also it can not be held that contract between the appellant and the state government was subsisting. in this view of the matter in our view further evidence led by the parties is not required to be dealt with or considered. from the aforesaid discussion it is apparent that there was no contract subsisting between the appellant and the state government so as to apply the provisions of section of the act and to hold that appellant was disqualified to contest the elections. as state above the order passed by the high court declaring dr. $$$ -respondent no. as elected is on the face of it illegal. in the result civil appeal nos. -of filed by prakash $$$ are allowed the impugned order passed by the high court declaring election of prakash $$$ the returned candidate as void and declaring dr. vijaykumar khandre who had polled the next highest number of valid votes as elected from no. bhalki legislative assembly constituency to the eleventh karnataka legislative assembly is quashed and set aside. in view of the order passed above civil appeal no. of stands dismissed. there shall be no order as to costs.
