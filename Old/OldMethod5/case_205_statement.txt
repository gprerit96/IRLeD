. leave granted. we have heard mr. $$$ learned counsel appearing for the $$$ and ms. $$$ learned amicus curiae for the respondents and perused the common impugned judgment dated.passed by the bombay high court. the short question that arises for consideration in these appeals is as to whether the high court was justified in passing the impugned judgment without formulating any substantial question of law. the facts of the case in a nutshell are that the plaintiff -respondents filed a civil suit for perpetual injunction against the defendant -$$$ seeking a decree restraining him from alienating the suit property. after a full -fledged trial the suit was dismissed. as against the judgment and decree passed by the trial court the plaintiff preferred an appeal before the district judge which was also dismissed by upholding the judgment of the trial court. aggrieved by the same the plaintiff -respondents filed appeals in the high court. the high court without formulating substantial question of law heard the appeals and reversed the judgment and decree passed by the trial court as also of the appellate court. consequently the suit was decreed. hence these appeals by special leave. without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case prima facie we are of the view that the matter need to be remitted to the high court to decide the appeal afresh. the high court in fact failed to notice the mandate of section $$$ of civil procedure while deciding a appeal. time and again this court has held that unless the high court is satisfied that there is a substantial question of law jurisdiction under section of the $$$ can not be exercised. although not necessary but to remind ourselves the law settled by this court we may refer some of the decisions hereinafter. in the case of shiv cotex v. tirgun auto plast p ltd. $$$ / sc/01/$$$$$$$ / sc/01/$$$$ scc against the concurrent judgment and decree of the courts a appeal was filed before the high court which has been allowed by the single judge and the suit had been remanded to the trial court for fresh decision in accordance with law. while deciding the appeal and reversing the judgment and decree of the courts the high court proceeded without formulating any substantial question of law. on these facts this court observed that. the judgment of the high court is gravely flawed and can not be sustained for more than reason. in the place the high court while deciding the appeal failed to adhere to the necessary requirement of section $$$ of civil procedure and interfered with the concurrent judgment and decree of the courts below without formulating any substantial question of law. the formulation of substantial question of law is a must before the appeal is heard and finally disposed of by the high court. this court has reiterated and restated the legal position time out of number that formulation of a substantial question of law is a condition precedent for entertaining and deciding a appeal. recently in $$$ v. bismillabi decided by us on --it has been held that the judgment of the high court is rendered patently illegal if a appeal is heard and the judgment and decree appealed against is reversed without formulating a substantial question of law. in the case of $$$ v. $$$ / sc/06/$$$$manu / sc/06/$$$$ scc the high court had allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the first appellate court. while allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment of the appellate court no substantial question of law was formulated. on these facts this court observed as under:. in our view the very jurisdiction of the high court in hearing a appeal is founded on the formulation of a substantial question of law. the judgment of the high court is rendered patently illegal if a appeal is heard and judgment and decree appealed against is reversed without formulating a substantial question of law. the appellate jurisdiction of the high court under section is not akin to the appellate jurisdiction under section of the $$$ it is restricted to such substantial question or questions of law that may arise from the judgment and decree appealed against. as a matter of law a appeal is entertainable by the high court only upon its satisfaction that a substantial question of law is involved in the matter and its formulation thereof. section of the $$$ provides that the appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated. it is however open to the high court to reframe substantial question of law or frame substantial question of law afresh or hold that no substantial question of law is involved at the time of hearing the appeal but reversal of the judgment and decree passed in appeal by a court subordinate to it in exercise of jurisdiction under section of the $$$ is impermissible without formulating substantial question of law and a decision on such question. this court has been bringing to the notice of the high courts the constraints of section of the $$$ and the mandate of the law contained in section that no appeal shall lie except on the ground mentioned in section yet it appears that the fundamental legal position concerning jurisdiction of the high court in appeal is ignored and overlooked time and again. the present appeal is unfortunately of such matters where the high court interfered with the judgment and decree of the appellate court in total disregard of the above legal position. in the case of $$$ v. $$$ / sc/031/$$$$manu / sc/031/$$$$ scc a suit for mandatory injunction was filed and the same was decreed by the trial court. challenging the judgment and decree of the trial court appeal was preferred which was eventually allowed. questioning the judgment and decree passed by the first appellate court a appeal was filed and the same was allowed by the high court and the judgment and decree passed by the appellate court was reversed without formulating any substantial question of law. on these facts this court held that the high court exercising jurisdiction under section of the code of civil procedure can not interfere with or reverse the judgment without formulating any substantial question of law. also in the case of b.c. shivashankara v. b.r. $$$ / $$$ / sc/13/$$$$ scc learned single judge of the karnataka high court allowed appeal and set aside the judgment and decree without formulating substantial question of law. this court therefore after referring earlier decisions of this court held that the judgment of the high court can not be sustained in law and the matter was remitted to the high court for its disposal in accordance with law. in the case of $$$.  v. antony m. saldanha manu / sc/6/$$$$manu / sc/6/$$$$ scc the high court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree passed by the courts below. while allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment no substantial question of law was framed by the high court. in that context this court reiterated as under:3. in view of of the code of civil procedure in short the code the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state substantial question or questions of law involved in the appeal as required under sub -section of section. where the high court is satisfied that in any case any substantial question of law is involved it shall formulate that question under sub -section and the appeal has to be heard on the question so formulated as stated in sub -section of section. in the case of mahavir v. lakhmi manu / sc/03/$$$$manu / sc/03/$$$$ scc it was reiterated by this court that while reversing the judgment and decree in appeal by the high court section code of civil procedure mandates to formulate substantial question of law before allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment and decree of the lower court. in the case of hardeep kaur v. malkiat $$$ / $$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc the appeal was allowed by the high court and the judgment and decree passed by the appellate court was set aside. the short question considered by this court was whether a appeal lies only on a substantial question of law and is it essential for the high court to formulate a substantial question of law before interfering with the judgment and decree of the lower appellate court. this court after considering almost all the earlier judgments held as under:1. the law consistently stated by this court that formulation of substantial question of law is a sine qua non for exercise of jurisdiction under section code of civil procedure admits of no ambiguity and permits no departure. in the present case the high court has allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment and decree of the appellate court without formulating any substantial question of law which is impermissible and that renders the judgment of the high court unsustainable. in shah mansukhlal chhaganial v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/3/$$$$ scc and $$$ v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/339/$$$$ scc this court reiterated the same view that the appeal can not be allowed by the high court without formulating any substantial question of law. in the case of $$$ v. $$$ / $$$ / sc/0664/$$$$ scc this court again took the view that the high court would not be competent to reverse the finding recorded by the trial court or the appellate court without formulating substantial question of law. in state of kerala v. puthenkavu.s.s. $$$ scc a appeal was filed against the concurrent finding recorded by both the trial court and the appellate court. however the high court exercising jurisdiction under section code of civil procedure interfered with the concurrent finding of facts and allowed the appeal. this court set aside the order holding that the judgment of the high court can not be sustained inasmuch as it reverses the judgment without formulating substantial question of law. the court observed thus:. both sides have advanced several contentions in the appeal petition as also in the counter -affidavit filed. we refrain from expressing any opinion on the merits of the case as we propose to remit the appeal for disposal afresh. we have noted that the learned single judge has not formulated any question of law much less any substantial question of law which alone would have clothed the high court with jurisdiction under section code of civil procedure to deal with a appeal. this court has stated time and again that unless the high court is satisfied that there is a substantial question of law jurisdiction for appeal can not be exercised. it is unnecessary to cite the authorities on that aspect as it has now become well -nigh settled. both sides agreed that no substantial question of law has been formulated by the learned single judge. if so the learned single judge ought to have proceeded further. in the case of ellangallur v. $$$ / sc/0014/$$$$manu / sc/0014/$$$$ scc this court considering a case where the high court in appeal reversed the finding of the appellate court on the re -appreciation of evidence without formulating any substantial question of law held that the judgment passed by the high court can not be sustained in view of the prescribed procedure of section of the code of civil procedure. same view has been reiterated by this court in the case of h.g. venkataramanaiah v. $$$ scc. similar view has been reiterated in the case of ramavilasom grandhasala v. n.s.s. karayogam manu / sc/0367/$$$$manu / sc/0367/$$$$ scc wherein it was held that the high court without formulating any substantial question of law as required under sub -section of section of the code can not allow appeal and set aside the judgment of the lower court. in the light of the provision contained in section code of civil procedure and the ratio decided by this court we come to the following conclusion:(i on $$$$ when the appeal is listed for hearing on admission if the high court is satisfied that no substantial question of law is involved it shall dismiss the appeal without even formulating the substantial question of law;(ii in cases where the high court after hearing the appellate is satisfied that the substantial question of law is involved it shall formulate that question and then the appeal shall be heard on those substantial question of law after giving notice and opportunity of hearing to the respondent;(iii in no circumstances the high court can reverse the judgment of the trial court and the appellate court without formulating the substantial question of law and complying with the mandatory requirements of section code of civil procedure. admittedly the high court by the impugned judgment allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment passed by the trial court and the appellate court. we have therefore no option but to set aside the impugned judgment passed by the high court and remit the matter back to the high court to formulate the substantial question of law and then decide all these appeals in accordance with law. hence we allow these appeals and remit these matters back to the high court to formulate substantial question of law and then decide all these appeals in accordance with law accordingly. since the plaintiff -respondents are old persons aged more than years and they have been fighting the litigation since we request the high court to give preference of hearing to these appeals and decide the same as expeditiously as possible preferably within $$$$ months from $$$$. however interim order passed by this court shall continue only for $$$$ months from $$$$. after hearing the respondents who appeared in person before this court $$$$ and informed about their financial status we request the maharashtra legal services authority to provide all legal assistance to them and to meet all legal expenses in defending the appeals in the high court. in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and considering the helplessness of the respondents who are old aged persons we direct the $$$ to pay a sum of rs. rupees twenty only towards the legal expenses incurred by them in pursuing the case in this court. mr. $$$ learned counsel for the $$$ very fairly submits that the $$$ be allowed some time to pay the aforesaid amount to the respondents. as prayed for weeks ' time is allowed to the $$$ to pay the aforesaid amount to the respondents. the registry is directed to communicate this order to the bombay high court forthwith.
