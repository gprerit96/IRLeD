hospital and they deposed that they were assaulted by unknown persons. however $$$$ who was examined after days has stated that he was assaulted by accused no. and not attributed any overt act to the appellants -accused no. and. it was further submitted that even as per the prosecution case the occurrence was due to a sudden fight and that when peace talks were going on between the complainant and the accused party and on being informed that anand belonging to accused party was cut by the complainant party fight ensued between groups and as the act was not committed in furtherance of the common intention the high court erred in convicting the appellants under section read with section indian penal code. taking us through the evidence on behalf of the respondent learned senior counsel mr. v. $$$ submitted that on exhortation by $$$ -accused no. the appellants and other accused attacked deceased -ramesh and injuries were caused in furtherance of common intention of all the accused would be liable under section read with section indian penal code for the act of committing murder of ramesh and the appellants have been rightly convicted by the courts below. we have carefully considered the rival contention and perused the impugned judgment and material on record. prosecution has examined witnesses out of which pws to are injured witnesses.  saravanan pw- muruganathan nephew of accused no. did not support the prosecution case and prosecution thus relied upon the evidence of pw-$$$ and pw-suresh and injured witness pw-kannan. in his evidence pw- stated that accused no. and attacked ramesh on his head with knives and accused no. to attacked ramesh on his face by stick and ramesh fell down on the road. suresh -pw had also stated that the appellants attacked ramesh by stick. pw-kannan injured witness stated that accused no. and accused no. attacked ramesh by knives on his head. so far as the overt act of the appellants pw-kannan stated that accused no. and took the wooden stick from a bullock cart standing nearby. pw- did not say anything about the overt act of the appellants. though the appellants denied their presence at the place of incident and pleaded that a false case has been foisted against them consistent version of pws and establish presence of the appellants and that they attacked ramesh with sticks. presence of the appellants and that they were armed with sticks is also substantiated by the evidence of injured witness kannan -pw. findings recorded by the courts below that the appellants attacked ramesh with sticks is unassailable. in the facts and circumstances of the case whether the high court was right in finding that the appellants acted in furtherance of common intention in committing murder of ramesh and whether the high court was right in attributing constructive liability to the appellants while convicting them under section read with section indian penal code is the point falling for consideration. to invoke section indian penal code it must be established that the criminal act was d by more than person in furtherance of common intention of all. it must therefore be proved that there was common intention on the part of several persons to commit a particular crime and the crime was actually committed by them in furtherance of that common intention. the essence of liability under section indian penal code is simultaneous conscious mind of persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular result. $$$ regarding the sharing of common intention gets satisfied when an overt act is established qua each of the accused. $$$ intention implies pre -arranged plan and acting in concert pursuant to the pre -arranged plan. $$$ intention is an intention to commit the crime actually committed and each accused person can be convicted of that crime only if he has participated in that common intention. the classic case on the subject is the judgment of the privy council in mahbub shah v. emperor $$$ / pr/00/9$$$ / pr/00/9 air pc wherein it was held as under..section lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. the section does not say the common intentions of all nor does it say an intention common to all. under the section the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. to invoke the aid of section successfully it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was d by of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all if this is shown then liability for the crime may be imposed on any of the persons in the same manner as if the act were d by him al. this being the principle it is clear to their lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre -arranged plan and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was d in concert pursuant to the pre -arranged plan. as has been often observed it is difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual in most cases it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case.underlining added)reiterating the above principles laid down by the privy council in mahbub shah 's case in $$$ and ors. v. state of gujarat $$$ / sc/008/96$$$ / sc/008/96 air sc this court held that the criminal act mentid in section indian penal code is the result of the concerted action of more than person and if the said result was reached in furtherance of the common intention each person is liable for the result as if he had d it himself. in ramesh singh alias photti v. state of a.p. $$$ / sc/078/$$$$$$$ / sc/078/$$$$ scc this court held as under:..as a general principle in a case of criminal liability it is the primary responsibility of the person who actually commits the offence and only that person who has committed the crime can be held guilty. by introducing section in the penal code the legislature laid down the principle of joint liability in doing a criminal act. the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention connecting the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. thus if the act is the result of a common intention then every person who did the criminal act with that common intention would be responsible for the offence committed irrespective of the share which he had in its perpetration. section indian penal code embodies the principle of joint liability in doing the criminal act based on a common intention. $$$ intention essentially being a state of mind it is very difficult to procure direct evidence to prove such intention. therefore in most cases it has to be inferred from the act like the conduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. the inference can be gathered from the manner in which the accused arrived at the scene and mounted the attack the determination and concert with which the attack was made and from the nature of injury caused by or some of them. the contributory acts of the persons who are not responsible for the injury can further be inferred from the subsequent conduct after the attack. in this regard even an illegal omission on the part of such accused can indicate the sharing of common intention. in other words the totality of circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had the common intention to commit an offence of which they could be convicted. see noor $$$. $$$ v. state of maharashtra manu / sc/7/$$$$manu / sc/7/$$$$ scc.underlining added). $$$ intention is seldom capable of direct proof it is almost invariably to be inferred from proved circumstances relating to the entire conduct of all the persons and not only from the individual act actually performed. the inference to be drawn from the manner of the origin of the occurrence the manner in which the accused arrived at the scene and the concert with which attack was made and from the injuries caused by or some of them. the criminal act actually committed would certainly be of the important factor to be taken into consideration but should not be taken to be the sole factor. under section indian penal code a pre -concert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved. the common intention to bring about a particular result may well develop on the spot as between a number of persons with reference to the facts of the case and circumstances of the situation. the question whether there was any common intention or not depends upon the inference to be drawn from the proving facts and circumstances of each case. the totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence with which they could be convicted. in the light of the above principles considering the present case in our view the facts and circumstances do not indicate that there was common intention to commit murder of ramesh. on.in the forenoon there were settlement talks which did not materialise and therefore they left the place stating that they could resume settlement talks in . on at about.p.m.pw-kannan pw-saravanan pw-suresh arumugam and nagarajan went to $$$ and resumed settlement talks. at that time person belonging to the accused party came and informed that at the corner of lane anand -friend of the accused party was cut by the person who came for the settlement talks. on hearing the same giri -accused no. and seenu -accused no. questid the complainant party as to how they could attack their man even when settlement talks were going on and so saying accused no. and took their knives which they were hiding behind their back and accused no. to took sticks from a cart standing nearby attacked pws and. at that time ramesh and his uncle pw- $$$ were coming in the opposite direction and on seeing them accused no. pointing out to ramesh exhorted others saying that ramesh belonged to kannan party and that he be cut and by so saying accused no. cut ramesh on his head with knife and seenu -accused no. also attacked ramesh with knife. the appellants and partheeban -accused no. have also attacked ramesh with sticks on his face. facts and circumstances of the case show that the attack was not a premeditated nor was there a prior concert. initially settlement talks were on and fight started only when the accused party was informed by their person that anand was cut by complainant party and thus the incident arose suddenly. no doubt common intention could develop even at the spur of the moment but in the present case the way the occurrence took place as depicted by the prosecution there could not have been common intention between the accused. the totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in order to arrive at a conclusion that the appellants had a common intention to commit the offence under which they were convicted. the appellants were not armed and admittedly they are said to have removed sticks from the bullock cart standing nearby and on the exhortation by accused no. the appellants have attacked ramesh. there may be similar intention in the minds of the assailants to attack but it can not be said that the appellants have acted in furtherance of common intention to attract constructive liability under section indian penal code. the facts and circumstances in our view do not give rise to an inference of pre -concert. for conviction of an offence read with section indian penal code it is necessary that there should be a finding as to the common intention of the participants. though the high court has modified the conviction from section read with section indian penal code as section read with section indian penal code the high court has not recorded any finding as to how the appellants shared the common intention to establish their constructive liability to sustain the conviction under section read with section indian penal code. the appellants are said to have attacked ramesh with sticks on his face. ramesh sustained nasal bone fracture probably due to the attack on the face. but this can not be said to be an act in furtherance of common intention to commit the murder of ramesh along with accused no. and. they are random individual acts done without meeting of minds and in our view the appellants can be held liable only for their individual acts. considering the totality of the circumstances conviction of the appellants under section read with section indian penal code can not be sustained and the same is modified as the conviction under section indian penal code and the sentence is modified to the period of imprisonment already undergone. for attacking the witnesses pw-kannan pw-muruganathan and pw5-suresh the appellants were convicted by the trial court under section read with section indian penal code and under section read with section indian penal code which was modified by the high court. no specific overt act is attributed to the appellants in attacking the prosecution witnesses and. as the appellants have not shared or acted in furtherance of common intention in the attack of the witnesses and therefore the conviction of the appellants as modified by the high court under section read with section indian penal code and under section read with section indian penal code can not be sustained and the same is liable to be set aside. conviction of the appellants balu a-4 and $$$ under section read with section indian penal code is modified as conviction under section indian penal code and they are sentenced to undergo imprisonment to the period already undergone. their conviction under section read with section indian penal code and under section read with section indian penal code is set aside and the appellants are acquitted of those charges. the appeal is partly allowed to the extent indicated above. the appellants are on bail. their bail bonds shall stand discharged.
