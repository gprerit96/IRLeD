on.. m. $$$ and others filed fdp no. of for preparation of final decree in which the compromise petition dated.was filed and compromise decree was passed on.. as per the compromise decree item no. of a schedule property was allotted to m. $$$ and item no. was allotted to m. $$$. an agreement to sale dated.was executed by m. $$$ in favour of partnership firm. similar agreement to sell dated.was also executed by m. $$$ in favour of firm. a suit no. of was filed by $$$ $$$s against defendants who are respondent nos. to in this appeal praying for permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the defendants or any claiming through them for transferring or alienating a schedule property. further the permanent prohibitory injunction was sought against the defendant regarding possession and enjoyment of property by plaintiff. the defendant had filed i.a. no. iv under section of arbitration and conciliation act hereinafter referred to as act on.praying to pass an order referring the parties to the arbitration for adjudication of the disputes raised by the plaintiff in the suit. the application was not accompanied by retirement deed and partnership deed. on.the original retirement deed and the partnership deed were produced by the defendant along with the list. the counter affidavit to the application i.a. no. iv was also filed by the plaintiff. the $$$ judge heard the i.a. no. iv as well as the objections raised by the plaintiff and by an order dated.pass the following order i.a. no. iv filed under section of the arbitration and conciliation act by the defendants is allowed.the parties to the suit are referred to the arbitration to settle their disputes and differences in view of the arbitration agreement.the suit of the $$$ stands disposed off accordingly. $$$ appearing for $$$s in support of this appeal raised following $$$ the application i.a. no. iv of praying for referring the matter to arbitration was not accompanied by the original retirement deed dated.and partnership deed dated.hence the application was liable to be dismissed under section and $$$ judge committed error in allowing the application. according to section of the act it is mandatory to file the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof along with the application seeking reference to the arbitration.all the parties to the suit were not parties to the arbitration agreement as claimed in retirement deed and partnership deed. hence dispute could not have been referred to the arbitrator.the firm being an unregistered firm no reference to the arbitration can be made with regard to the dispute relating to unregistered firm. $$$ appearing for respondents have refuted the submissions and contends that $$$ judge after considering all aspects of the matter have rightly made the reference to the arbitrator. it is submitted that there was clear arbitration agreement in the retirement deed as well as in the partnership deed as has been noted by district judge and the suit could not have proceeded. all the $$$ as well as defendant nos. to and defendant no. were parties to the arbitration agreement either personally or claiming through the person who was party to the agreement. the defendant no. has not inherited any right in the partnership firm and was unnecessarily impleaded by the plaintiff. mere presence of defendant no. as of the defendants does not preclude the implementation of arbitration agreement. with regard to non -filing of retirement deed and partnership deed along with application i.a. no. iv of submissions have been raised. firstly it is contended that the plaintiff themselves has filed both retirement deed and partnership deed along with the list of documents and having admitted both retirement deed and partnership deed non -filing along with the application i.a. no. iv was inconsequential. secondly the defendant themselves immediately after days of filing their i.a. no. iv of had filed the original retirement deed and partnership deed on.and at the time the matter was considered by district judge original deeds were on the record. hence the application i.a. no. iv was not liable to be rejected on this ground. there is no such provision which prohibits the adjudication of dispute by arbitration regarding an unregistered partnership firm. we have considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. from the pleadings on records and submissions made following issues arises for consideration:( whether non -filing of either original or certified copy of retirement deed and partnership deed along with application i.a. no. iv dated.entailed dismissal of the application as per section of act.whether the fact that all the parties to the suit being not parties to the retirement deed / partnership deed the court was not entitled to make the reference relying on arbitration agreement.whether dispute pertaining to unregistered partnership deed can not be referred to an arbitration despite there being arbitration agreement in the deed of retirement / partnership deed.issue no. facts which emerged from record in this respect need to be noted. firstly the $$$ in their plaint of o.s. no. of have referred to and admitted the retirement deed dated.and partnership deed dated.in para of the plaint. the $$$ themselves have filed the photocopies of deed of retirement dated.as the document no. in the list and photocopies of partnership deed dated.as document no. as have been noted in para of the district judge judgment.further although initially the application filed by defendant i.a. no. iv dated.was not accompanied by copy of retirement deed and partnership deed. the defendant on.filed the original retirement deed and partnership deed along with the list. it is useful to note the findings recorded by district judge in the above context in paragraph which is to the following effect:. the materials on record clearly goes to show that i.a. no. iv was filed by the defendants on.. it is true that the application was not accompanied by the retirement $$$ and the partnership $$$ either the originals or the certified copies. on.the original retirement $$$ and the partnership $$$ were produced by the defendants along with the list. section which falls for consideration in the present case provides as follows:8. power to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration a judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall if a party so applies not later than when submitting his statement on the substance of the dispute refer the parties to arbitration.the application referred to in sub -section shall not be entertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof.notwithstanding that an application has been made under sub -section and that the issue is pending before the judicial authority an arbitration may be commenced or continued and an arbitral award made. the $$$s submit that sub -section of section 8) provides that the application referred to in sub -section shall not be entertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof.they submit that admittedly with the application i.a. no. iv filed on.original or certified copy of the retirement $$$ and partnership $$$ was not filed. $$$ to the $$$s also placed reliance on a judgment of this court reported in $$$ / sc/0/$$$$$$$ / sc/0/$$$$ scc atul singh and ors. v. sunil kumar singh and ors. in the above case defendant had moved a petition on.praying for referring the dispute to arbitration. the trial court had dismissed the petition on the ground that the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff was not party to the partnership $$$ executed on.. hence the main relief being declaration of the deed to be void which could have been granted only by the civil court the dispute could not be referred. defendant filed civil revision which was allowed by the high court. of the submissions made before this court was that as per sub -section of section 8) the application could not have entertained unless it was accompanied by original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy thereof. this court held that there is no whisper in the petition that the original agreement or a duly certified copy is being filed. there was non compliance of section. hence the reference could not have been made. following was stated by this court in paragraph. there is no whisper in the petition dated.that the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof is being filed along with the application. therefore there was a clear non -compliance with sub -section of section of the act which is a mandatory provision and the dispute could not have been referred to arbitration. $$$ for the respondent has submitted that a copy of partnership deed was on the record of the case. however in order to satisfy the requirement of sub -section of section of the act defendant should have filed the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof along with the petition filed by him on.which he did not do. therefore no order for referring the dispute to arbitration could have been passed in the suit.it is relevant to note that in atul singh 's case supra the submission of respondent was noticed that the copy of the partnership $$$ was on the record of the case but the court has not proceeded to examine as to when such copies are already on record what is the effect. in this context the reference is made to judgment of this court in $$$ / $$$ / sc/8/$$$$ scc bharat $$$ v. u.p. electronics corporation ltd.in the above case judge bench of this court has held that photocopies of lease agreement could be taken on record under section for ascertaining the existence of arbitration clause. following was stated in paragraph. the respondent corporation placed on record of the trial court photocopies of the agreements along with an application under section of the arbitration act. the high court in our view has rightly held that the photocopies of the lease agreements could be taken on record under section of the arbitration act for ascertaining the existence of arbitration clause. thus the dispute raised by the $$$ sansthan against the respondent corporation in terms of the arbitration clause contained in the lease agreement is arbitral.in the case of atul singh supra which was also a judgment of judge $$$ earlier judgment in bharat $$$ was not cited. however for purposes of this case we need not enter into the issue as to whether there is a compliance of section if photocopies of the arbitration agreement is already on the record and not disputed by the parties. there is another aspect of the matter which is sufficient to uphold the order of the district judge. section uses the phrase shall not be entertained. thus what is prohibited is the entertainment of the application unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof. the word entertained has specific meaning in p. ramanatha aiyar 's advanced $$$ word entertained has been defined. to bear in mind or consider esp. to give judicial consideration to the court then entertained motions for continuance. to amuse or please. to receive(a person as a guest or provide hospitality to a person.the expression entertain means to admit a thing for consideration and when a suit or proceeding is not thrown out in limine but the court receives it for consideration and disposal according to law it must be regarded as entertaining the suit or proceeding no matter whatever the ultimate decision might be.the blacks law dictionary also defines this word entertain as follows to bear in mind or consider esp.to give judicial consideration to the court then entertained motions for continuance. in $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/ scc $$$ bank ltd. v. punnu sahu dead through legal representatives the word entertained came for consideration as occurring in order rule $$$ of civil procedure court. para of the judgment notices the amended $$$ which was to the following effect:. the amended proviso with which we are concerned in this appeal reads thus provided that no application to set aside a sale shall be entertained-(a upon any ground which could have been taken by the applicant on or before the date on which the sale proclamation was drawn up unless the applicant deposits such amount not exceeding and half percent of the sum realised by the sale or furnishes such security as the court may in its discretion fix except when the court for reasons to be recorded dispense with the requirements of this clause provided further that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity or fraud unless upon the facts proved the court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained substantial injury by reason of such irregularity or fraud.the contention of the $$$ was that word entertain refers to initiation of the proceedings and not to the stage when the court takes up the application for consideration. the high court had rejected the said contention. the above view of the high court was approved by this court in paragraph of the judgment. following was stated:4. before the high court it was contended on behalf of the $$$ and that contention was repeated in this court that clause of the proviso did not govern the present proceedings as the application in question had been filed $$$$ before that clause was added to the proviso. it is the contention of the $$$ that the expression entertain found in the proviso refers to the initiation of the proceedings and not to the sage when the court takes up the application for consideration. this contention was rejected by the high court relying on the decision of that court in $$$ v. jagan nath sharma $$$ / up/0/$$$ / up/0/ air all. the same view had been taken by the said high court in dhoom chand jain v. chamanlal gupta $$$ / up/0/$$$ / up/0/ air all and $$$ bux and sons v. firm samiullah and sons $$$ / up/00/$$$ / up/00/ air all and again in mahavir singh v. $$$ $$$ / up/008/4$$$ up/008/4 air all. these decisions have interpreted the expression entertain as meaning ' adjudicate upon or proceed to consider on merits. this view of the high court has been accepted as correct by this court in lakshmiratan engineering works ltd. v. asst. comm.sales tax kanpur $$$ / sc/00/7$$$ / sc/00/7 air sc. we are bound by that decision and as such we are unable to accept the contention of the $$$ that clause of the proviso did not apply to the present proceedings. another relevant judgment is manu / sc/00/$$$$manu / sc/00/$$$$ scc martin and harris ltd. v. vith additional district judge and others. in the above case section proviso of u.p. urban buildings regulation of letting rent and eviction act of word entertained came for consideration. the proviso to section was to the following effect:8. provided that where the building was in the occupation of a tenant since before its purchase by the landlord such purchase being made after the commencement of the act no application shall be entertained on the grounds mentid in clause(a unless a period of years has elapsed since the date of such purchase and the landlord has given a notice in that behalf to the tenant not less than months before such application and such notice may be given even before the expiration of the aforesaid period of years.in the above case the application under section was filed by the landlord before expiry of period of years from the date of purchase. it was held by this court that word entertained as employed in first proviso under section could not mean institution of such proceedings. in para and following was laid down:. even that apart there is an internal indication in the first proviso to section that the legislature has made a clear distinction between entertaining of an application for possession under section of the act and filing of such application. so far as the filing of such application is concerned it is clearly indicated by the legislature that such application can not be filed before expiry of months from the date on which notice is given by the landlord to the tenant seeking eviction under section of the act. the words the landlord has given a notice in that behalf to the tenant not less than months before such application would naturally mean that before filing of such application or moving of such application before the prescribed authority notice must have preceded by at least months. similar terminology is not employed by the legislature in the very same proviso so far as years ' period for entertaining such application on the grounds mentid in clause a of section a stage must be reached when the court applied its judicial mind and takes up the case for decision on merits concerning the grounds for possession mentid in clause a of section of the act. consequently on the very scheme of this act it can not be said that the word entertain as employed by the legislature in the first proviso to section of the act would at least mean taking cognizance of such an application by the prescribed authority by issuing summons for appearance to the tenant -defendant. it must be held that on the contrary the term entertain would only show that by the time the application for possession on the grounds mentid in clause a of section is taken up by the prescribed authority for consideration on merits atleast minimum years ' period should have elapsed since the date of purchase of the premises by the landlord. leaned senior counsel $$$ for the $$$ then invited our attention to decisions of this court in the case of lakshmiratan engineering works ltd. v. asstt. commr. judicial i sales tax and $$$ bank ltd. v. punnu sahu. in lakshmiratan engineering this court was concerned with the meaning of the word entertain mentid in the proviso to section of the u.p. sales tax act. hidayatullah j.speaking for the court observed in the light of the statutory scheme of section of the said act that the direction to the court in the proviso to section was to the effect that the court shall not proceed to admit to consideration an appeal which is not accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the admitted tax. in the case of hindustan commercial bank the term entertain as found in the proviso to order xxi rule code of civil procedure(cpc fell for consideration of the court. $$$ j.speaking for a bench of learned judges of this court in this connection observed that the term entertain in the said provision means to adjudicate upon or to proceed to consider on merits and did not mean initiation of proceeding. the aforesaid decisions in our view clearly show that when the question of entertaining an application for giving relief to a party arises and when such application is based on any grounds on which such application has to be considered the provision regarding entertaining such application on any of these grounds would necessarily mean the consideration of the application on the merits of the grounds on which it is base. in the present case therefore it must be held that when the legislature has provided that no application under section of the act shall be entertained by the prescribed authority on grounds mentid in clause a of section of the act before expiry of years from date of purchase of property by the landlord it must necessarily mean consideration by the prescribed authority of the grounds mentid in clause a of section of the act on merits. in the present case as noted above the original retirement $$$ and partnership $$$ were filed by the defendants on $$$$ and it is only after filing of original deeds that court proceeded to decide the application i.a. no. iv. section has to be interpreted to mean that the court shall not consider any application filed by the party under section unless it is accompanied by original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy thereof. the filing of the application without such original or certified copy but bringing original arbitration agreement on record at the time when the court is considering the application shall not entail rejection of the application under section. in the present case it is relevant to note the retirement $$$ and partnership $$$ have also been relied by the $$$. hence the argument of $$$ that defendants ' application i.a. no. iv was not accompanied by original deeds hence liable to be rejected can not be accepted. we are thus of the view that the appellants submission that the application of defendants under section was liable to be rejected can not be accepted.issue no. the relevant facts and pleadings of the parties have been marshaled by the trial court. trial court has returned the findings that the plaintiff no. represented by his mother and next friend was party to the retirement $$$. the mother of plaintiff namely smt. usha a. $$$ has signed the retirement deed for self and on behalf of her minor children the plaintiff no. plaintiff no. and claiming their rights through of the partners $$$ their father who was party to the retirement deed. in paragraph of the judgment $$$ judge had returned the following findings..therefore the plaintiff no. represented by his mother and next friend smt. usha a. $$$ is a party to the retirement $$$ and $$$ and are claiming their rights through of the partner late shri gangadhar $$$ who was also a party to the retirement $$$. the defendants to are also the parties to this retirement $$$. therefore except defendant no. all others are either personally or through the persons from whom they are claiming the right are parties to the $$$ of retirement $$$ dated...thus it was only defendant no. who was not party to the retirement deed or partnership deed. both and defendants are issues of late m. $$$. $$$ for the respondents have submitted that it was case of the $$$ themselves that by virtue of will executed by m. prakashchandra bhakta it was only defendant no. who became entitled to benefits of partnership and defendant no. was not given any share. the $$$ admittedly are parties to the arbitration agreement as noted above. it does not lie in their mouth to contend that since of the defendants whom they have impleaded was not party to the arbitration agreement no reference can be made to the arbitrator. in the facts of the present case it can not be said that merely because of the defendants i. defendant no. was not party to the arbitration agreement the dispute between the parties which essentially relates to the benefits arising out of retirement $$$ and partnership deed can not be referred. $$$ judge has noted that defendant no. has not inherited any share either in partnership deed or in the schedule property and hence there is no question of bifurcation of either cause of action or parties. relevant findings in this context have been returned by district judge in paragraph to the following effect:..it is only defendant no. was not the party to either the retirement $$$ or the partnership $$$ where there is an arbitration clause to refer all the disputes and differences to the arbitration. even according to the $$$ defendant no. is not a partner nor she is a party to any of the documents and further as per the will executed by her father late shri prakash chandra baktha she has not inherited any right or share either in the partnership $$$ or in the schedule property. moreover the plaint schedule property according to the $$$ is the property of the partnership firm m / s. ' neo subhash beedi works. therefore there is no question of bifurcation of either cause of action or parties if the same is to be referred to the arbitration as per the arbitration clause formed in the retirement $$$ dated.and the partnership $$$ dated...we fully endorse the above view taken by $$$ judge.issue no. the submission by the $$$ is that partnership being an unregistered partnership no reference can be made to the arbitration. in the present case there is no dispute between the parties that both retirement deed and partnership deed contain an arbitration clause. in retirement deed which had been signed by retiring partners continuing partners and concurring partners following was stated in clause..in case of any dispute or difference arising between the parties regarding the interpretation of the contents of this $$$ of retirement or any other matter or transactions touching the said retirement it shall be referred to an arbitration under the provisions of the arbitration & conciliation act..further in partnership deed which was.clause contains an arbitration clause which is to the following effect:. all disputes arising between the partners or their legal representatives about the interpretation of this $$$ or their rights and liabilities there under or in relation to any other matters whatsoever touching the partnership affairs shall be decided by an arbitration as provided by the arbitration & conciliation act.when the partners and those who claim through partners agreed to get the dispute settled by arbitration it is not open for the appellants to contend that partnership being unregistered partnership the dispute can not be referred. the petitioners have not been able to show any statutory provision either in act or in any other statute from which it can be said that dispute concerning unregistered partnership deed can not be referred to arbitration. we thus do not find any substance in the submission of the appellant. in the result we do not find any merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed.
