$$$ was received by the police officials of the naihati police station who immediately rushed to the scene of occurrence. after receiving an r.t. message at.hours the $$$ $$$ also arrived at the scene at.hrs and remained at the scene till.hours. $$$ went to the police station at about.-.pm alongwith $$$. $$$ wrote the complaint at dictation of $$$ and a written complaint was submitted to the police station. the fir no. of was registered under section of the indian penal code and section arms act naming accused $$$ $$$ sintu alias $$$ and $$$. $$$ $$$ received the fir while he was still at the scene of occurrence. $$$ $$$ on dictation of $$$ with a $$$ prepared the inquest report of the dead body at green view nursing home at.hours. after the inquest report was prepared the dead body was

complainant also filed a revisional application crr no. of challenging the order of the acquittal. the high court vide its judgment dated.set aside the order of the acquittal as regards to $$$ and $$$. it however confirmed the acquittal with regard to the sintu alias $$$ and $$$. acquittal of basudev paul was also affirmed. $$$ $$$ was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with a fine of rs.. $$$ has filed this appeal challenging his conviction and sentence. we have heard $$$ learned senior counsel appearing for the $$$ shri rupesh kumar learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent no. and $$$ learned counsel for the state of west bengal. $$$ learned senior counsel for the $$$ in support of the appeal contends that learned sessions judge after considering entire evidence on record had rightly come to the conclusion that evidence led by prosecution contradicts the prosecution story as to the genesis of occurrence hence did not commit any error in acquitting the $$$. it is contended that fir was ante -dated and ante -timed as rightly held by the trial court. he submitted that from the evidence of pw who gave the written complaint for lodging an fir it is clear that he went to the police station after.pm hence the fir could not have been lodged before.-.pm and mention of time of receiving the information in the fir as.hour clearly proves that it was ante -timed. $$$ further submits that fir in fact was lodged after inquest report and inquest report according to the evidence was prepared after the.hours. it is submitted that ante -timing and ante -dating of the fir was with object to falsely implicate the accused since by that time prosecution story was still in vacuum. $$$ referred to various contradictions in the statement of witnesses as noticed by trial court. he submits that high court committed error in reversing the order of acquittal. it is well settled that if on an evidence views are possible and the trial court exercises its discretion in having acquitted the accused high court ought not to interfere with the acquittal order. the fir was dispatched from the police station with great delay which could be placed before the magistrate only on nd july which also clearly proves that fir was not registered at the time and the date when it is claimed. mention of u.d. case no. in fir causes suspicion and serious doubts with regard to the authenticity of the fir and subsequent inquest report. prosecution failed to prove any motive for the murder and in absence of any motive $$$ could not have been convicted. $$$ appearing for the state as well as complainant have refuted submissions of learned counsel for the $$$. high court while reversing the acquittal order has properly reappraised the evidence and finding the guilt of the accused conviction has been recorded. there are more than eyewitnesses who have proved by their evidence place of occurrence death by bullet injury presence and participation of the $$$ in the crime which has been established beyond any reasonable doubt. there was no delay or discrepancy in the fir. fir being a genuine document trial court committed error in holding that fir is ante -timed and anti -dated. the high court after correctly appreciating the entire evidence on record has rightly reversed the acquittal order. with regard to the delay in sending the copy of the fir to the magistrate nothing was asked in the cross -examination of the i.o. further although much argument was raised before the trial court regarding ante -timing and ante -dating of fir but no questions were put before the i.o. and the sub inspector who recorded the fir when they appeared before the court. first we proceed to consider the submissions of the learned counsel for the $$$ regarding ante -timing and ante -dating of the fir. the trial court had formulated point no. as was the real fir suppressed and the fir proved as ante -dated. trial court had observed that pw went to the police station at about.pm but in the formal fir exh. it is recorded that information of the commission of offence was received at.hours on th june. this entry in exh. contradicts the aforesaid evidence of the pw as regard to the time of lodging of complaint to the police station. argument was raised before the trial court that fir was not only ante -timed but also ante -dated as such no reliance should be placed on the exh. magistrate had perused both the written complaint and the fir which bore the endorsement seen dated nd july. trial court held that fir was dispatched from the police station on nd june and was received at the magistrate court on rd june. the trial court had recorded its conclusion in following words at page no. the fir was antetimed and there was abnormal unexplained delay in dispatching the fir to the office of the learned magistrate as well as putting up the same before the learned magistrate adverse inference should be drawn against the prosecution. the fir can not be attached with much value.following observations were made by trial court at page no. if the fir was lodged after -p. as stated by the p.w. it would not lose it 's value in it 's entirety because it is not established that the fir proved at the trial was a subsequent or that it was written on any date after.. now coming to the evidence on record there is evidence of pw that he went to the police station between.pm and the first information report was written by $$$ on his dictation. both the above facts have been proved by statement of pw $$$ and pw $$$ both have signed the written complaint. shri sunil giri asi pw proved the recording of the fir on the basis of written complaint given by $$$. no suggestion was put to pw regarding the date or time of recording of the fir. shri sunil giri has proved the fir he further proved that he received the fir on june he proved his signature on the fir also. he denied the suggestion that fir was written on subsequent to june. thus there is no case of ante -dating the fir even the trial court did not accept the submission that fir was ante -dated. now we come to the main submissions that is ante -timing of the fir and delayed dispatch of the fir to the court of the magistrate. the sequence of the events as it emerges from the evidence brought before the court i. the evidence of pw and pw there is no doubt that pw went to the police station at about.pm. the statement of pw in this context is very relevant. pw in his statement has stated that on june when he was posted at police station naihati he was at village $$$ in connection with another case when at.hours he received an rt message that at mitra bagan crossing $$$ had been shot dead. he arrived at the spot at about.hours and remained there till.hours. he further stated that he prepared the sketch map on the spot and seized the certain articles including bicycles from the entrance of the party office room. the statement in his examination -in -chief following was stated by i.o.while i was at village $$$ under p.s. naihaati in connection with another case at. i received an r.t. message that at mitrabagan crossing $$$. $$$ had been shot dead. i then directly rushed to mitrabagan more. i arrived there at -hrs. there was law and order problem over the murder. there was blockage of road. i received the fir from the police station at the said mitrabagan crossing. i had been engaged with law and order maintain job upto.hrs. i went to the c.p.i.m. party office at mitrabagan crossing and prepared a sketch map thereof with index. in the cross -examination he has stated that asi sunil giri had send him the r.t. message. sunil giri asi thus had received the information of the murder of $$$ before.hours arrival of sub inspector tapan kumar mishra i.o. on the scene at the time as claimed is proved i.o. also went to the green view nursing home accompanied by s.i. $$$ where dead body of the deceased $$$ was laid. under the dictation of the i.o.the inquest report was prepared by $$$ sub inspector of police which has started on.hours. the inquest report which has been proved by witnesses and i.o. clearly records the following investigation report over the dead body of deceased $$$ years son of late $$$ of r.b.c. road p.s. naihati district north illegible)in c / w naihati p.s.u.d. case no. dt..and naihati p.s. case no. of.under section 0/ indian penal code & arms act. the inquest report thus mentid both unnatural death case u.d. no. dated th june and p.s. case no. of th june under section of indian penal code and arms act. from the above there can be no doubt that fir was registered before the inquest report of dead body started. the evidence indicates that information of death was received by the police station before.hours and police officials arrived at the spot immediately and the i.o. arrived at the spot at.pm by that time other police officials had already reached. the receipt and the recording of first information report is not a condition precedent for setting in motion of a criminal investigation. when the information that $$$ is shot dead police was duty bound to start investigation. this court in $$$ and ors. v. the state of kerala manu / sc/0078/7manu / sc/0078/7 scc stated following in paragraph observed by the privy council in k.e. v. $$$ the receipt and recording of information report by the police is not a condition precedent to the setting in motion of a criminal investigation. much emphasis has been laid down by the learned counsel for the $$$ on the fact that fir notes in column c time. the time.hours we have already noted that sunil giri sub inspector of police has recorded in the first information report. he had already received the information before.hours since he had sent the r.t. message to the i.o. information of cognizable offence having been received by the asi with regard to the mention of time at.in the fir which was recorded after.pm could have been explained if any questions were put to asi sunil giri. from the cross -examination of asi sunil giri it does not appear that any question was asked regarding the recording time.in the fir. the possibility can not be ruled out that while registering the fir on the basis of written complaint the asi recorded the time when he received the information in the police station of the death of $$$. in any view of matter the above in no manner diminishes the value or credibility of the fir. the information of murder was received before.hours at the police station which is fully proved by arrival of the police officers much before.hours as proved by i.o. hence mention of the time at.can be treated as the time of receipt of the information of the offence in the police station and there is no such inconsistencies in the fir so as to come to the conclusion that fir was ante -timed. fir as well as the inquest report both mentid the accused $$$. the inquest report has not been questid on any account. the offence having been committed at around -pm registration of the fir at the police station between.to.pm does not cause any reason to draw any adverse inference more so when after the occurrence the deceased was taken to the nearby nursing home where he was declared dead and body remained there till the inquest was over. the another circumstance which have been heavily relied by trial court and reiterated before us by learned counsel for the $$$ is dispatch of the fir to the magistrate with delay. this court in pala singh v. state of punjab manu / sc/099/$$$$manu / sc/099/$$$$ scc has held that delay in forwarding the fir to court is not fatal in a case in which investigation has commenced promptly on its basis. the i.o. after receipt of the information of an offence by r.t. message had arrived at the scene on.hours which clearly proves the prompt commencement of the investigation. fir was dispatched on nd june which has also been accepted by trial court. when no questions were put to i.o. in his cross -examination regarding the delay in dispatch at the time of hearing the accused can not make capital of the said delay in forwarding the fir. this court in rabindra mahto and anr. v. state of jharkhand manu / sc/09/$$$$manu / sc/09/$$$$ scc has held that in every case from the mere delay in sending the fir to the magistrate the court would not conclude that the fir has been recorded much later in time than shown. it is only extraordinary and unexplained delay which may raise doubts regarding the authenticity of the fir. the present is the case where recording of the fir on th june itself has been proved accepted by the trial court also thus mere dispatch of the fir on nd june from the police station to the magistrates ' court has no bearing on the basis of which any adverse presumption can be drawn. from the above discussion we are of the clear view that the fir was genuine fir and trial court committed an error in drawing adverse inference against the prosecution and refusing to attach value to the fir. the conclusion of the learned sessions judge that the fir was manipulated is thus found to be errous. fir has been proved by the evidence as noted above. thus of the basis of the decision of the sessions judge for discarding the prosecution case is knocked out. now we came to the consideration of oral evidence by sessions judge. both the deceased and accused belong to the same locality. the occurrence was witnessed by several persons including the eye -witnesses who appeared before the court and proved the prosecution case pw. sandip ghosh pw. vijay das pw. kamal nath pw. $$$ pw. prasanta ghosh pw. shashanka nath and pw shankar ghosh. pw. sandip ghosh the son of the deceased was in his medical shop maa medical stores which is at the distance of about cubits from cpi(m office. in his eye -witness account he stated that at pm when he was at his shop he found a motor vehicle a $$$ to come from side of naihati station and got itself parked on r.b.c. road after crossing $$$ and r.b.c. road crossing. he saw $$$ and $$$ got down from the said motor vehicle and at that very moment boys about age years came in front of aforesaid party office from side of mitra bagan by bicycle. he further saw $$$ and $$$ to point out his father sitting inside the party office. of the said boys took out a pipe gun and shoot $$$. $$$ further observed that hay gechi tara tari chale aiy. $$$ the said vehicle left. in the cross -examination the witness stood firm with his eye -witness account and could not be shaken. pw vijay das on $$$$ was standing at the gate of the party office inside of which $$$ was sitting. $$$ after taking the tea asked him to bring the beetle leave. he went to the beetle shop in front of the party 's office on the other side of road where he saw $$$ and $$$ to get down from $$$ at the crossing of r.b.c. road. at that time persons by bicycles came from the mitrapara side. of the said boys brought a shooter machine and fired $$$. $$$ all left towards gouripur. pw kamal nath who has a shop on the footpath in front of the cpi(m party office stated in his evidence that in the afternoon of th june at pm to pm he was sitting inside the party office and he went out of the office room and was standing outside smoking a cigarette. at that time a red gypsy came and statid at the distance of cubits from him from which $$$ and $$$ got down. at that very time persons came by bicycles from the side of mitra bagan. of the said persons fired from outside the party office and shot $$$. they left the bicycles and left the place by gypsy towards gouripur. the almost similar eye -witness account has been narrated by other eye -witness who were examined by prosecution. $$$ judge pointing out certain discrepancy / contradiction in the statement held that the evidence by eye -witnesses does not inspire confidence. $$$ judge had also made observation that no explanation had been offered by the prosecution as to why statement of witnesses under section code of criminal procedure was recorded with delay. the statement given by the eye -witness in the court can not be discarded merely on the grounds that statement which got recorded under section code of criminal procedure by the prosecution was not immediately recorded. the cross -examination of i.o. pw. does not indicates that the any explanation was asked from him regarding delayed recording of the statement under section code of criminal procedure. the high court has also re -appraised the entire oral evidence and had observed that eye -witnesses stick to their earlier statements except or witnesses who attempted to add something during the statements. following had been recorded by the high court at page..we have carefully examined the statement of the witnesses and also their statement recorded under section code of criminal procedure and we find that there was attempt on the part of or witnesses to add something more during their statement recorded before the learned magistrate but as a whole all the eye -witnesses sticked to their earlier statements given before the i.o. and they made the same statement before the trial court during their examination... after looking to the evidence of eye -witnesses high court has observed that all of them had deposed of arrival of $$$ presence of $$$ and $$$ on the place of occurrence and about giving instructions to shoot $$$ and subsequently helping the persons to flee from the place of occurrence by getting inside the $$$. following are the findings recorded by the high court..from the statements of pw. pw. pw. pw. pw. pw. and also from pw. we find that all of them deposed about arrival of a maruti gypsy vehicle presence of $$$ and $$$ on the place of occurrence and also about giving of instruction to shot at $$$ and subsequently for helping the persons to flee from the place of occurrence by getting inside the maruti gypsy vehicle... the appreciation of evidence of eye -witnesses and discarding the aforesaid evidences by the learned sessions judge was on flimsy ground and based on surmises and conjectures which has been correctly re -appreciated by the high court. for instance with regard to eye -witness pw vijay das learned sessions judge discard the evidence of pw by giving following reasons..in the statement recorded under section code of criminal procedure marked exhibit this gentleman told that on hearing sound of firing he rushed and found that $$$ was shot and was going to pick up the bicycle. at that time he tried to catch the said man and anjan said be quickly the pigs. in the statement recorded under section code of criminal procedure which was made more than months after the alleged date of occurrence did not name the person whom he tried to catch. so this omission contradicts the aforesaid evidence of the pw. the pw 's evidence being contradicted by his earlier belated statement under section code of criminal procedure as well as suffers from improbability can not be relied on... the mere fact that the witness did not name the person whom he tried to catch does not lead to any contradiction since all eye -witness have stated that persons came by bicycles of whom shoot $$$. pw stated that he tried to catch person of the aforesaid and omission not to name the person does not lead to any contradiction nor can result in discarding the evidence. the observation of learned sessions judge that the evidence suffers from the improbability and can not be relied is also not based on any valid reason. some minor contradiction has been pointed out by learned session judge in the evidence of other eye -witnesses which have rightly been discarded by the high court and the high court after re -appreciating the evidence has rightly come to the conclusion that the occurrence as well as participation of $$$ the $$$ was proved. following conclusion has been recorded by the high court..thus from the evidence on record we get that several witnesses of the locality who were present on the place of occurrence had noticed $$$ and $$$ on the place of occurrence and also noticed their active participation in the matter of murder of $$$ and in this context we want to record that the learned trial court totally misdirected itself in the matter of appreciation of the evidence of the eye -witness. high court was conscious that the case where acquittal has been made while entertaining an appeal over an order of acquittal if views are possible on making proper appreciation of available evidence the view going in favour of accused have to given importance. it is well settled that in case where an order of acquittal has been made on improper and erroneous appreciation of evidence it is always open to the court of appeal to make proper and reasonable appreciation evidence and differ from the order of acquittal and in such event it shall never hesitate in reversing the same. ultimately the high court concluded..from scanning of the entire prosecution evidence and having regard to submission of the respective parties we are constrained to hold that the learned trial court was totally wrong both in law and in fact in making its observation that the fir was antedated and anti timed and a manipulated. the trial court also erred in law by discarding the fir for delay in dispatching the same in the court of the magistrate. we are of the opinion that the findings and conclusion recorded by the high court are based on the correct appreciation of evidence and do not suffer from any error. the judgment of the high court reversing the acquittal recorded by learned sessions judge needs no interference. there are no merits in this appeal. the appeal is dismissed. the $$$ is on bail his bail bonds are cancelled and the $$$ is directed to be taken into custody forthwith.
