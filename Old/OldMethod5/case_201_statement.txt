$$$ j. $$$ condd. leave granted in all the special leave petitions. this group of cases may be conveniently arranged in different categories. the are the appeals arising from the judgment and order dated.passed by the gujarat high court declaring section of the gujarat provincial municipal corporations act hereinafter referred to as the gujarat act as ultra vires the constitution and on that basis interdicting the levy of property tax on mobile towers. the high court by the impugned judgment however took the view that the $$$ in a mobile tower in which bts system details of which are noticed below is located would be a building and therefore exigible to tax under the gujarat act. the state government and the different municipal corporations have challenged the part of the order of the high court whereas the cellular operators have challenged the later part. the bombay high court which was in seisin of a somewhat similar challenge by the order under challenge has taken the view that the writ petitions challenging the levy of property tax on mobile towers should not be entertained and the aggrieved writ petitirs therein cellular operators should be left with the option of exhausting the alternate remedies provided by the act. this would be the category of cases. in this regard it must be noticed that in the bombay provincial municipal corporations act the charging section does not specifically contemplate levy of taxes on mobile towers as in the gujarat act. the impugned levy nevertheless was imposed on the reasoning that mobile towers are buildings as defined in the act. at this stage it must also be noticed that the bombay provincial municipal corporations act was applicable to the state of gujarat also until the year when by the gujarat short titles amendment act the word gujarat has been inserted in place of the word bombay. the and categories of cases would be the writ petitions raising identical issues which have been transferred from the bombay high court to this court and the writ petitions filed before this court by the cellular operators under article of the constitution raising a similar challenge as in the writ petitions filed before the high court. as the elaborate arguments advanced in the course of the prolonged hearing have centered around the provisions of the gujarat act it may be convenient to take up the gujarat cases in the instance. the answer to the issues arising therein would in any way effectively decide the issues arising in the bombay cases also as well as in the transferred cases and the writ petitions filed under article of the constitution. the relevant provisions of the gujarat act defining the expressions building land and mobile tower are as follows section building includes a house out -house stable shed hut and other enclosure or structure whether of masonry bricks wood mud metal or any other material whatever whether used as a human dwelling or otherwise and also includes verandahs fixed platforms plinths doorsteps walls including compound walls and fencing and the like.xxx xxx xxx xxx xxxsection land includes land which is being built upon or is built upon or covered with water benefits to arise out of land things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth and rights created by legislative enactment over any street.xxx xxx xxx xxx xxxsection mobile tower means a temporary or permanent structure equipment or instrument erected or installed on land or upon any part of the building or premises for providing telecommunication services. section of the gujarat act the charging section is in the following terms:. taxes to be imposed under this act.for the purposes of this act the corporation shall impose the following taxes namely:(a property taxes either under section or under section aa.a tax on vehicles boats and animals.a tax on mobile towers provided that xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx8. section of the gujarat act deals with different compnts of the property tax which can be levied under the act. briefly put the said compnts are water tax conservancy and sewerage tax general tax of not less than % but not exceeding % of the rateable value etc. section aa deals with the rate at which water tax conservancy tax and sewerage tax are to be imposed. section of the gujarat act provides for the rate at which the general tax is leviable. section inserted by the gujarat local authorities laws amendment act provides for tax on mobile towers at rates not exceeding those prescribed by order in writing by the state government. such tax which is levied on mobile towers is to be collected from persons engaged in providing telecommunication services through service towers. section is in the following terms.tax on mobile towers.a tax at the rates not exceeding those prescribed by order in writing by the state government in this behalf from time to time shall be levied on mobile towers from the person engaged in providing telecommunication services through such mobile towers.the corporation shall from $$$$ in accordance with section determine the rates at which the tax shall be levied. by the aforesaid gujarat local authorities laws amendment act similar provisions for levy of tax on mobile towers have been inserted in the gujarat municipalities act and also the gujarat panchayats act. the short contention of the cellular operators advanced before the high court is that section read with section of the gujarat act are legislatively incompetent as mobile towers are beyond the scope of entry of list $$$ of the schedule to the constitution which is in the following terms. taxes on lands and buildings. the high court thought it proper to accept the said contention and on that basis to hold that levy of tax on mobile towers under the gujarat act is ultra vires the constitution except insofar as the $$$ that houses the bts system is concerned. significant aspects connected to the issues arising may be taken note of at the outset. the meaning of any legislative entry e.g. taxes on lands and buildings entry of list $$$ should not be understood by reference to the definition of the very same expressions appearing in a statute traceable to the particular legislative entry. in the present case though the gujarat act defines the expressions land and building as rightly held by the high court it would be self defeating to understand the meaning and scope of entry of list $$$ by reference to the definition clauses in the gujarat act. definitions contained in the statute may at times be broad and expansive beyond the natural meaning of the words or may even contain deeming provisions. though the wide meaning that may be ascribed to a particular expression by the definition in a statute will have to be given effect to if the statute is otherwise found to be valid it will indeed be a contradiction in terms to test the validity of the statute on the touchst of it being within the legislative entry by a reference to the definition contained in the statute. the aspect mentid above is concerning the permissible operation of different statutes relatable to different entries in list i or $$$ or even in list of the schedule to the constitution. this has been acknowledged by the high court in the impugned order by accepting that even if a mobile tower is a part of the apparatus pertaining to telegraphs covered by entry of list i yet the gujarat act could still co -exist as a statute levying a tax on lands and buildings so long and if only mobile towers can come within the scope and ambit of the aforesaid expressions land and building in entry of $$$. the endeavour therefore must be to trace out the true meaning of the expressions land and building appearing against entry of $$$ by a correct application of the parameters and principles governing the interpretation of a constitutional provision specially an entry in any of the legislative fields under the schedule to the constitution. certain accepted and settled principles of constitutional interpretation may now be taken note of. it will not be necessary to enter into any detailed deliberations and debate in this regard in view of the undisturbed precedents on which such principles have come to rest. broadly and illustratively some of the principles which have been culled out from the decisions of this court are enumerated hereinbelow.in interpreting the provisions of the constitution particularly the legislative entry a broad liberal and expansive interpretation is to be preferred as the meaning of an entry is always inclusive. synthetics and chemicals ltd. v. state of uttar pradesh $$$ / sc/05/989$$$ / sc/05/989 scc para.principles of interpretation of a statute are

the central excise and salt act $$$ / sc/007/96$$$ / sc/007/96 scr a bench of judges of this court has observed that neither the union nor the states can claim unlimited rights as regards the area of taxation. the right has been hedged in by considerations of respective powers and responsibilities of the union in relation to the states and those of the states in relation to citizens inter se or in relation to the union. part xii of the constitution relates to finances. at the very outset article lays down that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.that authority has to be found in the lists in the schedule subject to the provisions of part xi which deals with relations between the union and the states particularly chapter i thereof relating to legislative relations and distribution of legislative powers with special reference to article. article is in the following terms:( notwithstanding anything in clauses and parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in list i in the schedule in this constitution referred to as the union list.notwithstanding anything in clause parliament and subject to clause the legislature of any state also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$i in the schedule in this constitution referred to as the concurrent list.subject to clauses and the legislature of any state has exclusive power to make laws for such state or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in $$$ in the schedule in this constitution referred to as the state list.parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of india not included in a state notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the state list. though article has often been understood to be laying down the principle of parliamentary supremacy it must be qualified that such supremacy if any is extremely limited and very subtle. this has to be said when the federal structure of the indian union has been recognised as a basic feature of the constitution. both the central and the state legislatures are competent to enact laws in any matters in their respective lists i. list i and $$$. conflict or encroachments must be ird out by the courts and only on a failure to do so the provisions of article will apply. insofar as the common list i. $$$i is concerned any repugnancy in law making by the union and state legislatures is dealt with by article which gives primacy to the parliamentary law over the state law subject to the provisions of clause of article of the constitution which again is subject to a proviso which may indicate some amount of parliamentary supremacy. the fields of taxation on which the union parliament and state legislatures are competent to enact legislations to meet the constitutional mandate under article of the constitution are clearly indicated in the respective lists. while there can be no encroachment either way it is possible that in a given situation though there may be some similarity between the taxes levied by a central and a state enactment both can co -exist having regard to the subject of the levy. a tax on income derived from land and a tax on the land itself wherein the income or earning therefrom forms the basis of the rates of the levy of tax is such example. the above has been illustrated only to answer the arguments advanced before us on view expressed in the order under challenge by the high court that even if it is assumed that the cellular operators are right in contending that mobile towers are covered by the field telegraphs entry of list i it can not be said that if mobile towers can come within the fold of entry of $$$ such a legislation would be legislatively incompetent. the constitutional scheme with respect to financial relations between the union and the state is dealt with by part xii of the constitution. the scheme discernible contemplates an equitable distribution of revenues between the centre and the states. though the union and each of the federating units have their respective consolidated funds the financial arrangements and adjustments that are to be found in the different provisions of part xii of the constitution would indicate an attempt at equitable distribution of revenues between the union and the federating units even though such revenue may be derived from taxes and duties imposed by the union and collected by it or through the agencies of the states. a perusal of the legislative entries relating to taxes imposable by the central and the state legislatures do indicate that the larger share of the revenue goes to the union because of the very nature of the taxes leviable by the union parliament which would stand credited to the consolidated fund of the union. the allocation of revenue heads / taxation power in the states certainly shows a disequilibrium which however is sought to be balanced by the constitutional scheme aforementioned namely equitable distribution of revenues between the union and the states even though such revenues may be derived from taxes and duties imposed by the union and collected by it. this aspect of the constitutional scheme which has been echoed in para of the decision in state of west bengal v. kesoram industries ltd.supra has to be kept in mind as the discussions unfold. we may now see what a mobile tower is and consists of. in technical terms a mobile tower is called a base transceiver station.it involves the making of structure consisting of the following. a pre -fabricated shelter made of insulating puf material made of fibres. electronic panel. base transceiver station bts and other radio transmission and reception equipment.d. a diesel generator set. poles of to meters length each made of hollow steel galvanized pipes.a mobile tower is constructed either on vacant land or on the terrace of existing buildings on the basis of agreements with the owners of such properties. to answer the question as to whether such mobile towers can come within the fold of land and building appearing in entry $$$ of the schedule it will be useful to take notice of the meanings of the expressions as appearing in the leading judicial and english dictionaries. a comprehensive list of the different meanings expressed in different works so far as the expressions ' land and building are concerned are set out below.landstroud 's $$$ edition defines that land or lands not only means the surface of the ground but also everything except gold or silver mines on or over or under it for cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos co. $$$. a touch. bl. com. lord coke calls the earth the suburbs of heaven.black 's $$$ edition defines that land means an immovable and indestructible -dimensional area consisting of a portion of the earth 's surface the space above and below the surface and everything growing on or permanently affixed to it. the lexicographer further observes in its legal significance land is not restricted to the earth 's surface but extends below and above the surface. nor is it confined to solids but may encompass within its bounds such things as gases and liquids. a definition of land along the lines of a mass of physical matter occupying space also is not sufficient for an owner of land may remove part or all of that physical matter as nevertheless retain as part of his land the space that remains. ultimately as a juristic concept land is simply an area of -dimensional space its position being identified by natural or imaginary points located by reference to the earth 's surface. $$$ is not the fixed contents of that space although as we shall see the owner of that space may well own those fixed contents. $$$ is immovable as distinct from chattels which are moveable it is also in its legal significance indestructible. the contents of the space may be physically severed destroyed or consumed but the space itself and so the land remains immutable.$$$ land law edition.p. ramanatha aiyar 's $$$ edition observes that the word land is a comprehensive term including standing trees buildings fences stones and waters as well as the earth we stand on. standing trees must be regarded as part and parcel of the land in which they are rooted and from which they draw their support. the word land in the ordinary legal sense comprehends everything of a fixed and permanent nature and therefore embraces growing trees. all alj all.buildingstroud 's $$$ edition observes that what is a building must always be a question of degree and circumstances its ordinary and usual meaning is a block of brick or stone work covered in by a roof per esher m.r.moir v. $$$ q.b. the ordinary and natural meaning of the word building includes the fabric and the ground on which it stands victoria city v. bishop of vancouver island a.c. at

edifice enclosing a space within its walls and usually but not necessarily covered with a roof.p. ramanatha aiyar 's $$$ edition observes that building is a house out -house garage or any other structure which can not be erected without the ground on which it is to stand the expression building includes the fabric of which it is composed the ground upon which its walls stand and the ground within those walls. per d.g. gouse & co. v. state of kerala $$$ / sc/03/980$$$ / sc/03/980 air sc kerala building tax act section meaning of land and building'building is something with a roof and walls such as a house or factory. collins dictionary of the english language first edition ' refers to the solid part of the surface of the earth as distinct from seas lakes etc. collins dictionary of the english language first edition other english dictionaries convey a more or less similar meaning namely as understood in common parlance -an enclosed space used for human use and dwelling. a cardinal principle of interpretation of a legislative entry in any of the lists of the schedule is to treat the words and expressions therein as inclusive in meaning and give the same all possible flexibility instead of restricting such meaning to the perceptions contemporaneous with the times when the constitution was framed. the constitution an organic document has to be allowed a natural growth by such a process of interpretation. interpretation of a legislative entry has to grow and keep up with the pace of times. we may now see how judicial opinion has dealt with the question.in anant mills co. ltd. v. state of gujarat and ors. $$$ / sc/038/$$$$$$$ / sc/038/$$$$ scc this court had occasion to consider the scope and ambit of the provisions contained in entry $$$ in the context of the provisions of the very same act as applicable to bombay. sufficient illumination and elucidation flows from such consideration which is available in para of the report which may be very conveniently extracted below. mr. tarkunde on behalf of the petitioner company has urged that under entry of the state list in the schedule to the constitution the state legislature is empowered to enact a law relating to taxes on lands and buildings. it is submitted that the state legislature has no competence under the above entry to enact a law for levying tax in respect of the area occupied by the underground supply lines. the word land according to the learned counsel denotes the surface of the land and not the underground strata. we are unable to accede to the above submission. entry of $$$ contemplates a levy of tax on lands and buildings or both as units. such tax is directly imposed on lands and buildings and bears a definite relation to it. section makes provision for the levy of property tax on buildings and lands. section merely specifies the persons who would be primarily responsible for the payment of that tax. the word land includes not only the face of the earth but everything under or over it and has in its legal signification an indefinite extent upward and downward giving rise to the maxim cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum see p. corpus juris secundum. according to broom 's legal maxims edn.p. not only has land in its legal signification an indefinite extent upwards but in law it extends also downwards so that whatever is in a direct line between the surface and the centre of the earth by the common law belongs to the owner of the surface not merely the surface but all the land down to the centre of the earth and up to the heavens and hence the word land which is nomen generalissimum includes not only the face of the earth but everything under it or over it. in goodricke group ltd. and ors. v. state of w.b. and ors. $$$ / sc/0964/$$$$$$$ / sc/0964/$$$$ supp scc cess imposed on green tea leaves by weight was held to be a tax on land and not on the produce. in an earlier decision in ajoy kumar mukherjee v. local board of barpeta $$$ / sc/0266/1965$$$ / sc/0266/1965 air sc a levy on holding a market was held to be essentially a levy on land and therefore authorized by entry $$$ though the levy was imposed only on $$$$ when the market was held. this court in ajoy kumar mukherjee supra had inter alia held that it follows therefore that the use to which the land is put can be taken into account in imposing a tax on it within the meaning of entry of list ii for the $$$$ value of land which can certainly be taken into account in imposing a tax for the purpose of this entry would necessarily depend upon the use to which the land is put. it is in the light of this settled proposition that we have to examine the scheme of section of the act which imposes the tax under challenge. in municipal corporation of greater bombay $$$ / $$$ / $$$ air sc the definitions of land and building in sections and of the bombay provincial municipal corporations act were dealt with and considered by this court and a broad and wide meaning of the said expressions was favoured. however we may skip over the said part of the report in view of what has been earlier indicated by us namely that to test the vires of the provisions of the statute in question the scope and expanse of the words ' land and building has to be understood in the context of the provisions of the legislative entry entry list ii and not the $$$ relatable to the entry. however what would be of significance is to take into account the principles of interpretation which were followed by this court in coming to its conclusions with regard to the true meaning and scope of the expressions ' land and building contained in the statute. as already observed by us principles of interpretation of the ordinary statute are not foreign to the principles of interpretation of the constitutional provisions. paragraph of the report in municipal corporation of greater bombay supra may now be noticed. in s.p. gupta v. union of india $$$ / sc/0080/$$$$$$$ / sc/0080/$$$$ supp scc interpreting section of the indian evidence act this court held that the section was enacted in $$$$ but its meaning and content can not remain static. the interpretation of every statutory provision must keep pace with changing concepts and the values and it must to the extent to which its language permits or rather does not prohibit suffer adjustments through judicial interpretation so as to accord with the requirements of the fast changing society which is undergoing rapid social and economic transformation. the language of a statutory provision is not a static vehicle of ideas and concepts and as ideas and concepts change as they are bound to do in any country like ours with the establishment of a democratic structure based on egalitarian values and aggressive developmental strategies so must the meaning and content of the statutory provision undergo a change. it is elementary that law does not operate in a vacuum. it is not an antique to be taken down dusted admired and put back on the shelf but rather it is a powerful instrument fashioned by society for the purpose of adjusting conflicts and tensions which arise by reason of clash between conflicting interests. it is therefore intended to serve a social purpose and it can not be interpreted without taking into account the social economic and political setting in which it is intended to operate. it is here that a judge is called upon to perform a creative function. he has to inject flesh and blood in the dry skeleton provided by the legislature and by a process of dynamic interpretation invest it with a meaning which will harmonise the law with the prevailing concepts and values and make it an effective instrument for delivering justice.the discussions that had preceded on the financial relations between the union and the states would suggest a constitutional scheme wherein the federating states of the indian union are not destined to remain financially weak despite a situation where the union undoubtedly has the upper hand by an allocation of the more lucrative subjects of taxation under the schedule. constitutionality of the gujarat act in the above light must be answered in favour of the state. coming specifically to the expression building appearing in entry list ii of the schedule in view of the settled principles that would be applicable to find out the true and correct meaning of the said expression it will be difficult to confine the meaning of the expression building to a residential building as commonly understood or a structure raised for the purpose of habitation. in government of andhra pradesh and ors. v. hindustan machine tools ltd. $$$ / sc/0382/$$$$$$$ / sc/0382/$$$$ air sc scc a tax on a building housing a factory has been understood to be a tax on building and not on the factory or its plant and machinery. a general word like building must be construed to reasonably extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters and the common parlance test adopted by the high court to hold the meaning of levy of tax on building and machinery does not appear to be right keeping in mind the established and accepted principles of interpretation of a constitutional provision or a legislative entry. a dynamic rather than a pedantic view has to be preferred if the constitutional document is to meet the challenges of a fast developing world throwing new frontiers of challenge and an ever changing social order. the regulatory power of the corporations municipalities and panchayats in the matter of installation location and operation of mobile towers even before the specific incorporation of mobile towers in the gujarat act by the amendment and such control under the bombay act at all points of time would also be a valuable input to accord a reasonable extension of such power and control by understanding the power of taxation on mobile towers ' to be vested in the state legislature under entry of list ii of the schedule. the measure of the levy though may not be determinative of the nature of the tax can not also be altogether ignored in the light of the views expressed by this court in goodricke supra. under both the acts read with the relevant rules tax on mobile towers is levied on the yield from the land and building calculated in terms of the rateable value of the land and building. also the incidence of the tax is not on the use of the plant and machinery in the mobile tower rather it is on the use of the land or building as may be for purpose of the mobile tower. that the tax is imposed on the person engaged in providing telecommunication services through such mobile towers section of the gujarat act merely indicates that it is the occupier and not the owner of the land and building who is liable to pay the tax. such a liability to pay the tax by the occupier instead of the owner is an accepted facet of the tax payable on land and building under entry list ii of the schedule. viewed in the light of the above discussion if the definition of land and building contained in the gujarat act is to be understood we do not find any reason as to why though in common parlance and in everyday life a mobile tower is certainly not a building it would also cease to be a building for the purposes of entry list ii so as to deny the state legislature the power to levy a tax thereon. such a law can trace its source to the provisions entry list ii of the seventh schedule to the constitution. though several other decisions of this court and also of different high courts have been placed before us we do not consider it necessary to refer to or to enter into any discussion of the propositions laid down in the said decisions as the views expressed in all the aforesaid cases pertain to the meaning of the expressions ' land and building as appearing in the definition clause of the statutes in question. we therefore set aside the judgment passed by the gujarat high court and answer the appeals arising from the order of the bombay high court transferred cases and the writ petitions accordingly. however we leave it open so far as the cellular operators in the bombay cases are concerned to agitate the issue with regard to the retrospective operation of the assessment / demand of tax and the quantum thereof before the appropriate forum if so advised. consequently and in the light of the above all the appeals writ petitions and the transferred cases are disposed of.
