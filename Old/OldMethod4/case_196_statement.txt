wrote a letter to hsidc dated.stating that on account of his deteriorating financial condition he had decided to transfer his equity shareholding in the target company to the $$$ and that the $$$ had agreed to furnish his personal guarantee for buy -back of the lac equity shares held by hsidc. in the letter $$$ requested hsidc to accept the personal guarantee of the $$$ in lieu of his buy -back guarantee and to absolve him from the obligation. the $$$ also wrote a letter to hsidc dated.informing it that he and $$$ had entered into an agreement for purchase of equity shareholding of $$$ and for complete takeover of the management of the target company. the $$$ confirmed that he was prepared to buy -back the equity holding of hsidc as provided for in the assisted sector agreement instead of $$$ under similar terms and conditions. the $$$ also requested that since he was facing a stringent liquidity problem the payment for the buy -back which was due in april be instead made in $$$$ installments of rs. lacs each with effect from september. enclosed with the letter were post -dated cheques in respect of the said buy -back obligations amounting to a total of rs. hsidc vide its letter dated.to $$$ accepted the joint request made by him and the $$$. subsequently the $$$ $$$ and hsidc entered into a tripartite financial collaboration agreement whereby hsidc consented to the $$$ stepping into the shoes of. on.$$$ and the $$$ entered into an agreement whereby the $$$ agreed to purchase the entire share capital of.% held by $$$ at the rate of rs.per fully paid up equity share. since this acquisition was in excess of % of the total shareholding of the target company the regulations under the sebi substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers regulations were attracted. in order to comply with the regulations the $$$ made a public announcement on.making an offer to the remaining shareholders of the target company to purchase a minimum of % shares of the said company at an offer price of rs.per equity share. on.a draft letter of offer was sent by the merchant banker of the $$$ to sebi for its approval. neither in the public announcement nor in the letter did the $$$ disclose the fact that he and his associates had already bought back the shares of hsidc. sebi reverted with a letter dated.seeking clarifications from the merchant banker of the $$$. the letter stated that the price at which the $$$ proposed to acquire the shares from hsidc as per the agreement dated.had to be calculated and specified upfront in the offer document. further if the price payable to hsidc as per the said agreement was higher than the present offer price of rs.per share then the offer price must be justified as required under regulation. the draft letter of offer dated.was approved by the sebi subject to certain changes vide its communication dated.. as it transpired in response to the public announcement the $$$ could acquire only.% of the shares of the target company as the shareholders were not willing to offer their shares at rs.when their face value was rs.. sebi received a complaint from mr. $$$ alleging that the $$$ had acquired lac equity shares from hsidc for rs. at the rate of rs.per share whereas the shares were not offered at the same price to the existing shareholders. the complainant alleged that the $$$ was suffering from a liquidity crunch and had requested hsidc to receive the consideration amount with respect to the transfer of shares in $$$$ installments. the complainant also brought to the notice of sebi that the post -dated cheques through which the $$$ had tendered consideration had subsequently been dishonoured and criminal proceedings had been initiated against him. a copy of the said complaint was forwarded to the $$$ through his merchant banker. the $$$ moved an application on.stating that he was covered under the ambit of regulation and as a result was immune to the provisions under

on.regarding the non -disclosure of the payment of rs. by the $$$ through postdated cheques. the merchant banker in its letter dated.informed sebi that the $$$ had not informed him about the payment made through post -dated cheques. subsequently sebi wrote a letter to hsidc dated.asking whether the letter dated.pertained to the buy -back of shares and whether the post -dated cheques were deposited with hsidc as security for the buy -back obligations. the hsidc in its reply via letter dated.stated that the postdated cheques had been issued towards the purchase consideration for the buy -back of lac equity shares held by hsidc in the target company. sebi on being satisfied that a prima facie case of non -disclosure of material facts in the public announcement and a violation of regulations exists issued a show cause notice to the $$$. the $$$ filed his reply to the show cause notice after which sebi by its order dated.issued directions to the $$$ under section read with section of the act and regulations and of the regulations. the $$$ was directed to make a fresh public announcement for % shares as required under chapter of the regulations in accordance with regulation and offer to the shareholders of the target company the price of rs.per share along with interest at the rate of % per annum for the period from.to the actual date of payment of consideration. sebi further directed the $$$ to pay the balance amount at the aforesaid rate to all the shareholders who had offered their shares in pursuance to the public announcement dated.along with interest. aggrieved by this order the $$$ preferred an appeal. before the securities appellate tribunal the $$$ contended that the amount deposited with hsidc via post -dated cheques was not in consideration for the buy -back of shares. instead it was deposited by way of comfort / security for the buy -back obligation so as to demonstrate to hsidc that the $$$ was a man of means who could buy -back the shares subsequently an assertion which in any case stood belied by the dishonour of the cheques. the tribunal rejected this contention by placing reliance on letters. the letter issued by the $$$ on.was addressed to hsidc where in no uncertain terms the $$$ had stated that the payment by means of post -dated cheques was in consideration for the buy -back of shares. the letter referred to by the tribunal was issued by hsidc on.where in its reply to sebi 's clarificatory letter hsidc categorically stated that the payment by the $$$ was consideration for the buy -back of the shares. the tribunal also indicated that if the said amount had been deposited by way of comfort or security was being contended by the $$$ then it would have been a lump sum figure and not an amount as precise as rs. in light of the above stated facts it was held to be beyond doubt that the $$$ had paid the said sum as a consideration for the buy -back of shares at a rate of rs.per share. thus as a necessary corollary the said transaction had to be disclosed at the time of public announcement as provided under regulation. the tribunal observed that as the said transaction and its details were neither disclosed in the public offer nor in the letter of offer made to the other shareholders sebi was correct in directing the $$$ to go in for a fresh public announcement and offer to the remaining shareholders of the target company the rate of rs.per share. the $$$ also contended that the said post -dated cheques had subsequently been dishonoured hence no payment could be said to have been made in respect of the buy -back of shares. furthermore the shares held by hsidc had not been transferred in the name of the $$$ or his associates so the acquisition had not reached its stage of fruition. $$$ the price offered to hsidc could not be taken into consideration as provided under regulation of the regulations to determine the minimum offer price. minimum offer price.the offer to acquire the shares under regulation or shall be made at a minimum offer price which shall be payable--(a in cash by exchange and/or transfer of shares of the acquirer company if the person seeking to acquire the shares is a listed body corporate or(c by exchange and/or transfer of secured instruments with a minimum of a grade rating from a credit rating agency;(d a combination of clause a or c):provided that..for the purposes of sub -regulation the minimum offer price shall be the highest of-(a the negotiated price under the agreement referred to in sub -regulation of regulation the highest price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him for any acquisitions including by way of allotment in a public or rights issue if any during the week period prior to the date of public announcement;(c the price paid by the acquirer under a preferential allotment made to him or to persons acting in concert with him at any time during the months period up to the date of closure of the offer;(d the average of the $$$$ high and low of the closing prices of the shares of the target company as quoted on the stock exchange where the shares of the company are most frequently traded during the weeks preceding the date of public announcement.explanation... the tribunal observed that from a perusal of regulation it was clear that the highest price paid by an acquirer for any acquisition would be taken into consideration for determining the minimum offer price. as the $$$ had paid rs.per share to hsidc within the period of weeks prior to the date of public announcement this transaction had to be taken into consideration for determining the minimum offer price. the tribunal negated the specific contention of the $$$ finding that irrespective of whether acquisition took place or not regulation stood attracted as the amount was paid for the purpose of the acquisition. the $$$ contended that as his buy -back from hsidc was a transfer of shares from a state level financial institution to a co -promoter of the target company it was exempt under regulation. thus in turn the same transaction need not be taken into consideration to determine the minimum offer price. the tribunal dismissed this contention by stating that the exemption under regulation was only with respect to making a public announcement. the said exemption does not permit the $$$ from not disclosing the transaction for the purpose of calculating the minimum offer price. aggrieved by the decision of the tribunal the $$$ has now filed this appeal. $$$ for the $$$ contends that regulation uses the expression acquisition and submits that as the said acquisition was to happen in the future the regulation was not applicable to him. further the post -dated cheques that had been deposited were given in the form of a guarantee to hsidc. counsel submits that the buy -back was initially due in april but was subsequently postpd till $$$$ and thus as the buy -back was to take place in $$$$ it is then that the rate would have been calculated and determined. reliance has been placed on a letter issued by hsidc dated.addressed to the $$$ stating that the purchase consideration of the shares under buy -back agreement could not be determined as on date and the equity had to be bought back by the promoters at a purchase consideration which would be calculated as per the terms contained in clause of the tripartite agreement. counsel relies on a letter issued by hsidc dated.wherein it was communicated to the $$$ that the post -dated cheques which he had deposited were dishonoured on presentation due to non -availability of sufficient funds with the accounts and thus as there had been no payment no acquisition had taken place. to further buttress this contention learned counsel relied on a letter issued by hsidc dated.addressed to sebi wherein it was averred that the transfer of shares to the incoming collaborators would be effected only on the deposit of the entire amount of purchase consideration. learned senior counsel for the respondent contends that the regulations were triggered when the purchase was made by promoter from another that is by the $$$ from $$$ and not from the purchase by the $$$ from hsidc. evidence was placed on record to prove that the $$$ was still carrying on business of the target company. counsel contended that on.the $$$ agreed to step into the shoes of. on.hsidc received intimation from the $$$ regarding the agreement and also received postdated cheques amounting to rs. as consideration for the purchase of lac equity shares in the target company thus taking his share in the target company to.%. on.the tripartite agreement between the $$$ $$$ and hsidc was entered into. subsequently on.the $$$ and $$$ entered into an agreement as per which the $$$ purchased $$$ 's entire share capital of shares amounting to.% share in the target company at the rate of rs.per fully paid up equity share. it was this transaction which triggered regulation as there was an acquisition of more than % of the total shareholding of the target company. in order to comply with regulation the $$$ made a public announcement within working days as prescribed in regulation on.. the rate that was being offered by the $$$ at which he would acquire shares from the public was rs.. in response to the public announcement the $$$ could only acquire.% of the shares of the target company which was not surprising as the rate at which the shares were being offered to be purchased by the $$$ was lower than the face value of the shares. counsel relied on a letter issued by hsidc to sebi dated.wherein it was categorically mentioned that the cheques issued by the $$$ to hsidc were consideration for the buy -back of the shareholding held by hsidc in the target company. finally learned senior counsel places reliance on regulation which provides the contents of the public announcement of which of the disclosures that a company had to make is to state the highest and the average price paid by the acquirer or persons acting in concert with him for acquisition if any of shares of the target company made by him during the month period prior to the date of public announcement. the issue that has to be addressed before us is whether the transaction of buy -back of shares which transpired between the $$$ and hsidc was required to be disclosed in the public announcement dated.. in order to determine this requirement we must examine the operative clauses of the relevant regulations. regulation states that regulations and shall have no applicability to any transfer of shares from state level financial institutions including their subsidiaries to co -promoter(s of the company pursuant to an agreement between such financial institution and such co -promoter(s. regulations and mandate the making of a public announcement if any of the criteria mentioned therein are satisfied. regulation provides the contents and essential disclosures that are to be made at the time of making a public announcement. regulation establishes the method of computation to be employed in order to determine the minimum offer price which the acquirer must offer to purchase shares in a public announcement under regulation or. it is evident from a reading of the above regulations that the buy -back transaction between the $$$ and hsidc was incapable of triggering regulation as the said transaction was protected by regulation. however the acquisition of the entire share capital of garg by the $$$ attracted regulation as the acquisition was in excess of %. further as this transaction was between promoters it did not have the protection of regulation. as required under regulation the $$$ did make a public announcement but did not disclose its buy -back transaction with hsidc. the $$$ has vainly and incorrectly attempted to justify his act of non -disclosure by stating that the transaction with hsidc was protected by regulation which placed it beyond the ambit of regulation and. in our view regulation only protects a transaction between a co -promoter and a state financial institution to the extent that as a consequence of such transaction a public announcement will not be required to be made as provided under regulations and. however it does not imply that the said transaction is to be protected from the rigours of other regulations provided for under the act. thus the transaction between the $$$ and hsidc will have to be subject to regulations and and the rate at which the $$$ bought back the shares from hsidc had to be disclosed in the public announcement. we also find no force whatsoever in the contention of the learned counsel for the $$$ that the post -dated cheques forwarded to hsidc enclosed with letter dated.were given by way of a guarantee especially in light of the fact that the same was denied by hsidc in its letter to sebi dated.wherein hsidc stated that the post -dated cheques had been issued in consideration of the buy -back of shares. the next contention that was raised by the counsel for the $$$ was that as the cheques presented had been dishonoured on presentation the said transaction did not culminate in an acquisition. it has already been held beyond doubt that the post -dated cheques issued by the $$$ in favour of hsidc were in consideration of the buy -back of the shares held by hsidc in the target company. the $$$ had submitted that the cheques were post -dated because he was suffering from a liquidity crunch. in our view the post -dated cheques amounted to a promise to pay and that promise would be fulfilled on the date mentioned on the cheque. thus this promise to pay amounted to a sale of shares / equity. the subsequent dishonouring of the post -dated cheque would have no bearing on the case. at the time of making the public announcement the $$$ had bought back the shares of hsidc by making payment via the said post -dated cheques. further as the buy -back was in pursuance of an agreement there was consensus ad idem. the $$$ has subsequently shirked his responsibility and has tried to slither away from honouring the agreement which he can not be allowed to gain from as is established by the legal maxim commodum injuri su non habere debet. while interpreting the term acquisition we must conceptualize the intention behind these regulations which it seems to us is to safeguard the shareholders from adverse consequences of acquisitions and takeovers as far as the value of the shares is concerned. not infrequently the new management 's endeavour is to manipulate the market price of the shares in a manner calculated to induce the existing shareholders to off load their holdings at a low price. this is achieved by portraying a false picture of their value. in the background of such an intention it would fallacious to suggest that the said transaction did not tantamount to an acquisition. in order to dispel doubts regarding the term acquisition the same was subsequently defined in the securities and exchange board of india substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers regulations. under regulation clause sub -clause a)-'acquisition means directly or indirectly acquiring or agreeing to acquire shares or voting rights in or control over a target company. this definition clarifies that an acquisition takes place the moment the acquirer decides or agrees to acquire irrespective of the time when the transfer stands completed in all respects. the definition explicates that the actual transfer need not be contemporaneous with the intended transfer and can be in futuro. further the letter on which the counsel for the $$$ had placed reliance to prove that there was no acquisition is dated.which was well after the public announcement dated.where the $$$ was required to make disclosures in compliance with the regulations. this clearly indicates that at the date of making the public announcement the $$$ was under the impression that the acquisition has taken place. we neither find any merit in the appeal nor any infirmity in the order of sebi dated.. thus appeal is dismissed.
