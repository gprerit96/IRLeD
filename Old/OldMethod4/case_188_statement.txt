in dispute that the appellants in relation to the amount of compensation awarded by the respondents herein for acquiring their properties entered into agreements in the prescribed form under the

therein. the learned counsel drew our attention to the said provisions of section of the act and submitted that in a case where the parties entered into an agreement in terms of clause a of$$$ -section of section of the act there is no reason as to why the parties can not enter into another agreement having regard to the fact that the arbitrator has awarded enhanced compensation for acquisition of similarly situated lands. the learned counsel drawing our attention to the provisions of$$$ -section of section of the act would submit that compensation required to be paid even under the act being on the market value of the land and thus the criteria for determination of compensation being the same the provisions of the land acquisition act should be held to be applicable being implicitly embodied therein. in support of the said contention strong reliance was placed on $$$ ekramul haq v. the state of west bengal $$$ / sc/0055/98$$$ / sc/0055/98. the act was enacted to provide for the requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property for the purpose of the union. the history of the said legislation and the purport and object thereof need not be noticed by us in view of the question involved herein. section of the said act provides for power of the central government to requisition immovable property. section empowers the competent authority to take possession of the requisitid property. section which provides for rights over requisitid property reads thus:-"rights over requisition property.all property requisitid under section shall be used for such purchases as may be mentid in the notice of requisition.where any premises are requisitid under section the competent authority may order the landlord to execute such repairs as may be necessary and are usually made by landlords in that locality and as may be specified in the notice within such reasonable time as may be mentid therein and if the landlord fails to execute any repairs in pursuance of such order the competent authority may cause the repairs specified in the order to be executed at the expense of the landlord and the cost thereof may without prejudice to any other mode of recovery be deducted from the compensation payable to the landlord. a requisitid property can be released from requisition in terms of section section confers power upon the central government to acquire the requisitid property. the principles and method of determining compensation are laid down in section of the said at which reads as under:-8. principles and method of determining compensation.where any property is requisitid or acquired under this act there shall be paid compensation the amount of which shall be determined in the manner and in accordance with the principles hereinafter set out that is to say:-(a where the amount of compensation can be fixed by agreement it shall be paid in accordance with such agreement.where no such agreement can be reached the central government shall appoint as arbitrator a person who is or has been or is qualified for appointment as a judge of a high court;(c the central government may in any particular case nominate a person having expert knowledge as to the nature of the property requisitid or acquired to assist the arbitrator and where such nomination is made the person to be compensated may also nominate an assessor for the same purpose;(d at the commencement of the proceedings before the arbitrator the central government and the person to be compensated shall state what in their respective opinion is a fair amount of compensation;(e the arbitrator shall after hearing the dispute make an award determining the award of compensation which appears to him to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom such compensation shall be paid and in making the award he shall have regard to the circumstances of each case and the provisions of$$$ -section and so far as they are applicable;(f where there is any dispute as to the person or persons who are entitled to the compensation the arbitrator shall decide such dispute and if the arbitrator finds that more persons than are entitled to compensation he shall apportion the amount thereof amongst such persons;(g nothing in the arbitration act shall apply to arbitrations under this section. $$$ -sections 2a and of section of the act lay down the mode and manner for determination of compensation on requisitioning of the property. $$$ -section of section thereof reads as under:( the compensation payable for the acquisition of any property under section shall be the price which the requisitid property would have fetched in the open market. if it had remained in the same condition as it was at the time of requisitioning and been sold on the date of acquisition. the acquisition of the lands of the appellants as also the award and the writ petitions as noticed hereinbefore have been made and disposed of prior to coming into force of section of the land acquisition act. the act is a self -contained code. the act not only lays down a criteria for determination of compensation but also provides for the mode and manner thereof. the procedures for determining the award of compensation are not the same. the provisions of the land acquisition act are -facie not applicable for determination of compensation under the act. the provisions of the land acquisition act and the act are thus not in pari -materia. section of the land acquisition act on the other hand lays down the factors which are required to be taken into consideration in determining the amount of compensation. the mode and manner in which the compensation payable for acquisition of land under the act and land acquisition act are thus distinct and different. we fail to see as to how the provisions of section of the land acquisition act can be made applicable in relation to a proceeding under the act. furthermore the criteria for determination of compensation in terms of$$$ -section of section must be viewed with the limitations contained therein. in any event the market value of a property may also be determined from the stand -point of a willing purchaser of the land ready and willing to offer the consideration therefore to a buyer. the owner of a land normally would opt for the best offer. once he has agreed to a price so far as he is concerned the same ordinarily should be presumed to be the best offer which he could get. it may be true that in haji mohammad ekrmul haq 's case supra this court observed that even in the matter of payment of compensation under the act the criteria laid down under the land acquisition act would be applicable. however section of the act underwent amendments and the provisions of the act having not only laid down a complete machinery but also the mode and manner of determining compensation the said decision of this court can not be said to have any application in the instant case. this court in gurbachan singh 's case supra and babu singh 's case supra in view of the aforementid distinction following the judgment of this court in hari $$$ 's case supra clearly laid down the law that section of the land acquisition act can not be applied in relation to an acquisition proceeding under the act. reliance placed by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the $$$ in hukam chand and ors. v. state of haryana and ors. $$$ / sc/86/996$$$ / sc/86/996 is mis -placed. therein the questions raised herein did not fall for consideration. in the land acquisition act a provision exists for reference whereas in terms of the provisions of act only in the event the owner of the land does not accept the amount of compensation offered to him the dispute in relation thereto may be referred to an arbitrator. we may note that although in these cases the dispute as regards amount of compensation was not referred to arbitrator but the appellants herein filed writ petitions claiming solatium and interest. they thus did take the matter to a competent court of law and the said proceeding had a direct bearing on the amount of compensation received by them. in he event it be held that the provisions of section of the land acquisition act is maintainable in a proceeding under the act not only there would be an enhancement in the quantum of compensation but also corresponding enhancement in solatium and interest which in view of the orders passed in the writ petitions would be impermissible. in union of india and ors. v. dhanwati devi and ors. $$$ / sc/2/996$$$ / sc/2/996 a judge bench of this court:"4. the question therefore emerges whether it is necessary for the state legislature to expressly specify that interest or solatium shall not be payable for the lands of property acquired under section of the act. $$$ silentio is eloquent. it would further be seen that section of the central act equally does not provide for payment of solatium and interest. the act was passed in the year while the central act was passed in. it would therefore be reasonable to conclude that the state legislature was cognizant of the express provisions for payment of interest and solatium available in the acquisition act. the act omitted similar provisions for payment of interest and solatium as part or compnt of compensation obviously to fall in line with the central act. the bench agreed with the reasoning in hari $$$ case supra. the ratio of dhanwanti devi case applies in the instant case. the decision of this court in nagpur improvement trust supra may not be of much assistance in the instant case inasmuch as therein it was noticed that the u.p. avas evam vikas parishad $$$ nagpur improvement trust act as also the punjab town improvement act which tell for consideration therein had a common scheme and pattern as the state legislations relate to town planning and development and in terms of which each of them as regards acquisition of land the land acquisition act was made applicable with certain modifications as contained in the schedules appended thereto. in that view of the matter the bench followed the earlier decision of this court in u.p. avas evam vikas parishad supra wherein of us hon'ble the chief justice was a member. therein hari krishan khosla supra was held to be not applicable as provisions of the land acquisition act as amended by the act relating to determination and payment of compensation were held to be applicable to acquisition of land for the purposes of the $$$. as at present advised and furthermore in view in the factual matrix involved in the present appeals we do not intend to enter into the question as to whether the said decisions have correctly been rendered or not. it is he admitted case of the appellants that they entered into with the respondents agreements as regards the amount of compensation payable for acquisition of their lands in the prescribed form in terms of clause a of sub -section of section. what was only questioned by them in the writ proceedings was non -payment of solatium and interest. the high court in the said writ proceedings indisputably came to the conclusion that even solatium and interest was payable. the correctness or otherwise of the said decisions is not in question. however once it is held that section of the land acquisition act is not applicable in relation to lands of the appellants the only question which survives for consideration is as to whether the appellants have any legal right to force the respondents herein to enter into a fresh agreement relying on or on the awards passed by the arbitrator in. the answer to the said question in our considered opinion must be rendered in the negative. it has rightly been accepted at the bar that in the event a reference is made to an arbitrator by the owner of the lands section of the land acquisition act would not be applicable. the parties herein entered into agreements in terms of clause a of sub -section of section and thus the same falls within the realm of a contract and parties thereto would ordinarily be bound thereby unless the same is vitiated by fraud misrepresentation etc. once the matter is concluded by a contract novation of contract would also fall within the realm of contract only. if the contention of mr. $$$ is accepted a contract can be reopened only with the agreement of both the parties. the parties must be ad -idem therefore. the person whose lands were acquired thus having entered into an agreement can not be said to have any legal right which can be enforced in a court of law so as to enable him to obtain an order from the court directing the union of india to reopen the agreement only because by reason of a subsequent award an enhanced amount of compensation has been paid for similar class of lands. if a right to get the amount of compensation re -determined is held to be implicit in the act the same for all intent and purport would amount to invoking the provisions of section of the land acquisition act indirectly which can not be done directly. it is a well -settled principle of law that what can not be done directly can not be done indirectly. the enforceable right to re -open a proceeding which has attained finality must exist in the statute itself. the right to get the amount of compensation re -determined must expressly be provided by the statute. such a right being a substantive one can not be sought to be found out by implication nor can the same be read therewith. the appellants thus can not invoke a right by reading the same into a statute although admittedly there exists none. it is well -settled principle of law that the court can not read anything into the statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous. the court has to find out legislative intent only from the language employed in the statutes. surmises and conjectures can not be restricted to for interpretation of statutes. see union of india and ors. v. filip tiago $$$ of vedem vasco $$$ $$$ / sc/0622/1989$$$ / sc/0622/1989. this court in bhavnagar university v. $$$. ltd. and ors. $$$ / sc/1092/2002$$$ / sc/1092/2002 air2003sc511 has observed:-"scope of the legislation on the intention of the legislature can not be enlarged when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous. in other words statutory enactments must ordinarily be construed according to its plain meaning and no words shall be added altered or modified unless it is plainly necessary to do so to prevent a provision from being unintelligible absurd unreasonable unworkable or totally irreconcilable with the rest of the statute. see also unique butyle tube industries pvt. ltd. v. u.p. financial corporation and ors. $$$ / sc/1218/2002$$$ / sc/1218/2002. for the views we have taken we are of the opinion that it is not necessary to go into the larger question raised by the learned counsel for the parties in these matters. submission of mr. $$$ to the effect that the $$$ himself having made an award by order dated 30th may the central government could not have filed a writ petition is stated to be rejected. the contention of the central government respondent herein in the writ petition was that as the provision of section of the land acquisition act being not applicable the special land acquisition collector acted illegally and without jurisdiction in reopening the matter and passing a supplementary award. such a contention was raised on the basis of a decision of this court. furthermore the special land acquisition collector is a creature of the statute. he therefore was bound to act within the -corners thereof. if he has passed an order invoking a provision of law which was not applicable he committed jurisdictional error and the order impugned before the high court by the respondents was a nullity. we therefore can not accept the contention of the appellants that the respondents was not a person aggrieved and thus could not have maintained the writ petition. it was submitted that the respondents having filed a writ petition after a period of years the same ought not to have entertained. primarily a question of delay and latches is a matter which is required to be considered by the writ court. once the writ has exercised its jurisdiction despite delay and latches on the part of the respondents it is not for us at this stage to set aside the order of the high court that ground alone particularly when we find that the impugned judgment is legally sustainable. for the foregoing reasons we do not find any merit in these appeals which are accordingly dismissed but in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
