b.p. singh j. this appeal has been preferred by the appellants herein i. $$$ $$$ and $$$. $$$ is the father of $$$ and $$$. the appeal arises out of an incident that occurred on th march in which innocent lives were lost. $$$ the deceased were $$$ brother of $$$ accused his wife $$$ his daughter $$$ and his son -in -law $$$. since $$$ had only daughter namely $$$ the appellants virtually annihilated the entire family of $$$ who resided in village $$$ with his wife his daughter and his son -in -law. it is the case of the prosecution that the daughter of $$$ and his son -in -law lived with him and looked after $$$ and his wife and also cultivated the lands. the appellants were put up for trial before the additional district and sessions judge east champaran $$$ who by judgment and order dated.in sessions trial no. of found the appellant $$$ guilty of the offence under section ipc and section of the arms act and sentenced him to death under section ipc and ipc. appellants $$$ and $$$ were found guilty of the offence under section ipc and section arms act. they were also sentenced to death under section of ipc. the trial court passed no separate sentence under section of the arms act. aggrieved by the judgment and order of the trial court the appellants preferred $$$ no. of before the high court of judicature at patna. the learned additional sessions judge also made a reference to the high court for confirmation of the sentence of death passed against the appellants which was registered as $$$. of. the high court after a detailed and critical scrutiny of the evidence on record affirmed the conviction of the appellants. on the question of sentence the high court affirmed the sentence of death passed against the appellants $$$ and $$$ but refused to confirm the sentence of death passed against $$$ and instead sentenced him to life imprisonment under the aforesaid sections. the high court in doing so noticed that though $$$ carried a licensed gun with him and though he exhorted his sons to finish the entire family he did not use his gun in the course of the incident and therefore did not cause any injury to any. the appellants have preferred this appeal challenging the judgment and order of the high court. as noticed earlier the occurrence took place on.at about.a. in village $$$. the investigating officer pw- of kesaria police station has deposed that on $$$$ he heard a rumor that some persons have been killed in village $$$ in connection with land dispute. he therefore made station diary entry no. $$$t.and immediately proceeded to the place of occurrence. he recorded the statement of babu nand dubey $$$ of $$$ deceased and father of $$$ the son -in -law of $$$ deceased. the report was recorded at about.a. on the basis of which a formal f.i.r.$$$t.was registered. in his report to the police stated that his son $$$ was married to $$$ daughter of $$$ about years ago. since $$$ had no other issue and his daughter and son -in -law were looking after him he and his wife gifted their share of lands measuring about bighas to their daughter and son -in -law. this gave a rise to strained relationship between $$$ deceased and his brother appellant $$$. according to the informant in connection with such land dispute a $$$ was to be held on the date of occurrence and for that purpose he along with his son pw-$$$$ $$$ bhagya narain dubey not examined pw-$$$$ shivji dubey his brother pw- $$$ pw- $$$ and pw-$$$$ nawal kishore dubey had come to village $$$ at about a.. at about.a. when they were near the kirana shop of $$$ $$$ and $$$ armed with country made pistols and $$$ armed with his licensed gun came near the kirana shop. $$$ fired his gun in the air as a result of with persons nearby got scared and concealed themselves here and there. in the meantime his son $$$ came on hearing the report of gun shot. on seeing him the accused caught him and started assaulting him. $$$ exhorted his sons to kill him as also the other members of the family. upon this $$$ felled $$$ on the ground and fired at his chest causing an injury as a result of which $$$ died instantaneously. the accused then proceeded towards the house of $$$. $$$ the daughter -in -law of informant came out of the house. $$$ caught hold of her and fired at her head as a result of which she also died on the spot. $$$ $$$ and his wife $$$ came out of their house. $$$ fired at $$$ who fell down are died. similarly $$$ fired at sheoji $$$ causing an injury on her head as a result of which she also died instantaneously. many persons witnessed the occurrence. on the basis of the fir lodged by babu nand dubey investigation was taken up and ultimately the appellants were put up for trial charged variously of offences under section and ipc and section of the arms act. the prosecution examined as many as witnesses to prove its case. pws and are the eye witnesses. pws and are the medical officers who performed the post mortem examination on the dead bodies of the deceased. pw- is a formal witness who proved the deed of gift $$$t.dated.pw- is the investigating officer. we may notice at this stage that all the eye witnesses belong to village $$$ the village of the informant. the evidence on record also discloses that village $$$ is at a distance of only from the village of occurrence namely $$$. though it is the case of the prosecution that a large number of villagers of village $$$ had witnessed the occurrence there is also evidence on record to the effect that n of them was willing to depose against the appellants in the case. pw- the informant has fully supported the prosecution case. the fir was lodged by him. in his deposition before the trial court he stated that $$$ had no son and $$$ was his only daughter. $$$ and his wife $$$ both deceased gifted their entire lands to their daughter and son -in -law through deeds of gift. $$$ used to look after $$$ his wife and also cultivated the lands. $$$ the brother of $$$ lived separately from his brother even from before the marriage of his daughter. they were unhappy on account of the fact that $$$ had executed gift deeds in favour of his daughter and son -in -law and they were persuading $$$ deceased to get the deeds of gift cancelled and remove their daughter and son -in -law from the village. $$$ were held earlier also in respect of the gifted lands but $$$ did not obey the decision of the panchayat. a $$$ was to be held on th march regarding the same dispute. $$$ and $$$ jointly fixed another date for $$$ which was to be held in . it was in this connection that he and the eye witnesses had come from village $$$ to village $$$. he further stated that on reaching village $$$ he had sent his son $$$ $$$$ to $$$ and $$$ to inform them that they had arrived in the village for the $$$. accordingly rabindra dubey went to inform them. he returned after some time and told his father that $$$ deceased had told him that he was coming along with the panchas but $$$ was very angry and abused him. after rabindra dubey had returned they heard the sound of gun shots coming from the side of darwaza of $$$. they got alarmed on hearing the sound of gun shots. $$$ they saw the appellants coming to the chowk crossing $$$ armed with his double barrel gun and $$$ and $$$ armed with country made pistols. after coming to the crossing again $$$ fired in the air. soon thereafter $$$ came to the crossing. he was caught hold of by $$$ and $$$ who started assaulting him. $$$ singh then exhorted his sons to kill him and eliminate the entire family. thereupon $$$ shot at $$$ with his country made pistol which hit him on the left side of his chest. $$$ fell down and died. the witness then narrated about the manner in which the other persons were killed. the version given by him in court is consistent with the version disclosed in the fir. it is the deposition of pw- that shambhu saran dubey married a time with the daughter of $$$. since $$$ and $$$ had no issue $$$ persuaded $$$ to marry again and it was with her consent that $$$ remarried. the relationship between the and wives of $$$ was cordial. in fact the wife of $$$ also died on.since on account of grief she stopped taking food and water and virtually starved herself to death. pw- further stated that at about or.a. the sub inspector of police came to the village and recorded his statement at the darwaza of $$$. he put his signature on the statement marked $$$t. he mentid about deeds of gift executed by $$$ and his wife in favour of $$$ and $$$. the deed of gift relating to bighas of land was executed on.which was marked as $$$. the deed of gift at it appears from the evidence of pw- is dated.marked as ext.which related to about bigha and kathas of land. in cross examination this witness stated that he and the witnesses were to steps behind the accused persons when the occurrence took place. $$$ had become a sadhu and his wife also led a saintly life. he had been suggesting to his samdhi since that the dispute should be resolved by $$$. he had also talked to the villagers as well as to the accused persons in this connection. several $$$s were held since. this witness admitted that his samdhi $$$ his wife $$$ and their daughter $$$ had filed title suit against his son $$$. this case was got filed by the appellants by misleading $$$. the suit ended in favour of his son $$$ against which the plaintiffs filed an appeal but the same was compromised. all this was d at the instance of the accused persons whom is guided his samdhi but ultimately the matter ended in a compromise. even after the compromise was recorded in t.a. no. the dispute between $$$ and the accused persons subsisted. the accused persons used to cut the trees belonging to his samdhi and such other small disputes arose from time to time about which complaints were made to the mukhiya of the village. the witness met his samdhi $$$ a day before the occurrence. he had also met him on $$$$ when he had requested him to come for the $$$ to be held on $$$$. after the occurrence large number of persons about in number had collected near the place of occurrence. the crowd had collected hour after the occurrence and he named the persons whom he recognized in the crowd. this witness has stated that when he saw that his son $$$ was being assaulted he wanted to go to his rescue but nawal kishore dubey pw- caught hold of him. similarly shivji dubey pw- caught hold of his son rabindra dubey no wanted to intervene. the firing took place from a short distance of about to -feet. the entire occurrence took place within minutes i. between.&.a.. police station kesaria is situated at a distance of about -kilometers from the place of occurrence. we have very carefully scrutinized the evidence of$$$0 who is not only the informant but also an eye witness. we find nothing in his rather lengthy cross examination which may impeach his credibility. he has deposed in a straightforward manner and we find a ring of truth in what he says. moreover his evidence is fully corroborated by the medical evidence on record and the testimony of eye witnesses. $$$ $$$ is also an eye witness. he had come to village $$$ where he met the informant and others near the kirana shop of $$$. he has deposed about the prevailing strained relationship between $$$ and $$$ deceased owing to the execution of deeds of gift by $$$ in favour of his daughter and son -in -law. $$$ wanted that the deeds of gift be cancelled. this witness had also come in connection with the $$$ to be held in at.a. he has deposed about the occurrence in substantially the same manner as the informant pw-. this witness stated that the earlier deed of gift was executed by $$$ and his wife on.in respect of land measuring about bigha kathas. he was a witness to the said deed of gift. that deed of gift was marked as ext. this witness also stated that the distance between villages $$$ and $$$ is . he admitted that there was no written intimation about the convening of $$$ but he was informed verbally about it on th march at o'clock in the morning. information was sent to him by $$$ deceased with a request that he should attend the $$$. the sub inspector of police had reached the place of occurrence at about a. and the superintendent of police and dy. superintendent of police also arrived at about . he had seen the sub -inspector of police recording the statement of witnesses. his statement was recorded by the dy. superintendent of police at about . a large number of villagers of $$$ and other villages had collected numbering about. though they were present n of the villagers of $$$ made a statement before the police. he did not hear any saying that any dacoity had been committed in the house of $$$. $$$ for the appellant could not point out anything in the cross -examination of this witness which may render his deposition unreliable or untrusrthy except for submitting that his testimony is too consistent to be believed. pw- $$$ is another eye witness who had accompanied the informant to village $$$ in connection with the $$$ to be held on $$$$. his evidence fully corroborates the testimony of $$$$ informant and this led counsel for the appellants to submit that the consistency in the evidence of the witnesses must persuade this court to hold that they are got up witnesses. nothing however was shown to us in the cross -examination of this witness which may reflect upon his veracity. pw- nawal kishore dubey also deposed as an eye witness. he has fully supported the prosecution case and deposed about the manner of occurrence on the same lines as the informant and the other eye witnesses. he has stated that his statement was recorded by the police on that very day and that he was present when the police arrived at the scene of occurrence. he has deposed about the manner in which the investigation was conducted and proved the signatures of witnesses appearing on the seizure lists exts.and. nothing has been pointed out by the counsel for the appellants which may lead us to discard his testimony. remaining eye witnesses pws. and are the son and brother respectively on the informant $$$$. both of them have been cross -examined at length but nothing of significance has been elicited from them. pw- rabindra dubey is the son of the informant and the younger brother of deceased $$$. he has deposed about the marriage of his brother with $$$ and about the execution of gift deeds in their favour which gave rise to unpleasantness between $$$ deceased and $$$. he has asserted that he reached the chowk of village $$$ at about a. his father asked him to go and inform $$$ and $$$ that persons had arrived at the chowk for $$$. he went to $$$ where he met his brother $$$. he was told that they will be coming soon. $$$ he went to the darwaza of $$$ singh whom he saw sitting with a gun. as soon as he saw him he became furious and started abusing him. he then returned to the chowk and reported to his father. he has narrated the manner in which he occurrence took place. we have found nothing in the cross examination of this witness which may lead us to suspect his testimony. his presence appears to be quite natural since a $$$ was to be held concerning the lands which were gifted to his brother. it was therefore natural for him to accompany his father to attend the $$$. this witness was present when the sub -inspector of police came and later the superintendent of police and the dy. superintendent of police arrived. he also stated that large number of persons had assembled after the occurrence belonging to different villages. the sub -inspector of police recorded the statement of witnesses including his statement. by p. recording of statements was completed. he denied the suggestion that a crowd had assembled since a dacoity was committed in the house of $$$ in . in fact that was no talk of dacoity. similar is the evidence of pw-$$$$ shivji dubey who is the brother of the informant. this witness has also narrated the occurrence in the same manner as the other eye witnesses. he also mentid the presence of other eye witnesses named in the fir. we find that as many as eye witnesses have been examined by the prosecution. nothing has been elicited in their cross -examination which may lead us to doubt their reliability or truthfulness. the only criticism leveled against them is that of them are relatives of the informant and all the belong to village $$$. it was faintly suggested that their evidence is too consistent to be true. it is no doubt true that pws. and are related. and are brothers and $$$ is the son of pw- the informant. however having regard to the facts of this case their evidence can not be discarded merely on the ground that they are related to each other. there is abundant evidence on record to establish that on th march a $$$ was to be held concerning the disputes between $$$ deceased and $$$ accused. the dispute related to the lands gifted by $$$ to his daughter and son -in -law. pw-10 the informant being the father of shambhu sharan dubey son -in -law of $$$ was naturally interested in attending the $$$. in fact $$$ had requested him to attend the $$$. his brother and son had accompanied him to village $$$. having regard to these facts their evidence can not be thrown out merely on the ground that they are related and interested witnesses. the eye witness account given by these witnesses is natural as well as consistent. their presence at the scene of occurrence can not be doubted in view of the overwhelming evidence on record. they are not only named in the fir but their presence is confirmed by the other eye witnesses. it was then urged that all the eye witnesses belong to village $$$ and no witness from village $$$ has been examined. apart from the eye witnesses even the investigating officer pw-1 has deposed that persons belonging to village $$$ were not willing to make a statement before him and therefore no witness of village $$$ could be examined as an eye witness. it is obvious that the occurrence must have been witnessed by a large number of persons belonging to village $$$ since it took place between.and.a. in the heart of the village. however on account of village relationship their reluctance to depose against the appellants can be well appreciated. the co -villagers perhaps did not want to get themselves involved in this affair. the eye witnesses no doubt belong to village $$$ but can not ignore the fact that $$$ is at a distant of from village $$$. on the request of $$$ deceased and on the persuasion of the informant these witnesses had come to take part in the $$$ to be held . they can not therefore be described as mere chance witnesses. they had come to that village with a purpose and were not mere passers by. we have found their deposition to be convincing and truthful. the consistency in the evidence of the eye witnesses is also understandable in the facts of this case. the witnesses were known to each other and they also knew the appellants and their victims. the occurrence took place in the morning and there was sufficient light to enable the witnesses to identify the appellants and the deceased. the assault on the victims was not simultaneous. they were shot dead after the other. the witnesses were only to steps behind the assailants and had therefore the opportunity to notice the manner in which the occurrence took place and the role played by the appellants. there was therefore no scope for any confusion in the mind of the witnesses. their statements were recorded immediately after the arrival of the investigating officer. in these circumstances the case of the prosecution can not be disbelieved merely because the testimony of the eye witnesses is consistent by raising a suspicion that they may be got up or tutored witnesses. another feature of the case is that the occurrence took place between.and.a. soon thereafter the sub -inspector of police pw-1 reached the village on hearing a rumor after making an entry in the station diary. though the police station is about kilometers away from the village of occurrence he showed great promptness in reaching the village of occurrence at about.a. he recorded the statement of the informant pw-10 and commenced investigation. there was hardly any delay in lodging the fir and therefore there was no opportunity for the informant to concoct a false story. all the eye witnesses are named in the fir and their presence is confirmed by the fact that their statements were also recorded immediately by the investigating officer. moreover by even the superintendent of police and the dy. superintendent of police had reached the village of occurrence to supervise the investigation. the postmortem examination of dead bodies was also held on $$$$ by different medical officers. this is a rare case where we have found that the investigating agency acted with great promptitude. we therefore do not suspect that the prosecution concocted a false case. the trial court as well as the high court have carefully scrutinised the evidence on record. the medical evidence on record fully supports the prosecution case and it has been so found by the high court as well as by the trial court. we have also g through the deposition of the medical officers. we are satisfied that the injuries suffered by the deceased resulting in their death as found by the medical officers corroborate the manner of occurrence as deposed to by the eye witnesses. $$$ for the appellants submitted that the firing was obviously from close range but this fact is also established by the medical evidence on record. in fact some of the injuries bore charring marks. we are therefore satisfied that the medical evidence fully corroborates the case of the prosecution. the defence set up by the appellants was that a dacoity was committed in the house of $$$ on intervening and th march. in the course of the dacoity all the members of the family were shot dead by the dacoits. the appellants also examined witnesses to substantiate their defence. the trial court as well as the high court have carefully examined the evidence of the witnesses examined by the defence but came to the conclusion that the defence set up by the appellants was not supported by any reliable evidence on record. we have carefully g through the deposition of the defence witnesses and we find that the conclusion reached by the courts below is fully justified. $$$ stated that a dacoity was committed in the house of deceased $$$ in which he and his family members were killed. many people had assembled when the dacoity was committed but no information was given to the policy by any. he no doubt stated that $$$ the chowkidar has informed the police. the said chowkidar has not been examined. similar assertion was made by who belongs to village $$$ and claimed to be present in village $$$ when the dacoity took place. he claimed to have constructed a $$$ in village $$$ but he could produce no document to show that he owned any land in $$$ or that he had constructed a $$$. he also stated that no case of dacoity was registered. so far as is concerned he claims to have heard that dacoity was committed in the house of $$$. obviously no value can be attached to his statement. what is conspicuous in the evidence of the defence witnesses is that fact that though a dacoity is alleged to have been committed and as many as persons lost their lives no informed the police about the occurrence even though large number of villagers had assembled when the dacoity took place. apart from the other villagers would have expected the appellant $$$ the brother of $$$ to have informed the police about the occurrence in which members of his brother 's family were shot dead. in any event he would have made an attempt to send information to the police station. it does not appear that any such attempt was made by $$$. moreover the case that a dacoity had been committed in the house of $$$ was sought to be built up for the time at the stage of the trial. the eye witnesses to whom such suggestion was made categorically denied having heard any talk about commission of dacoity on the date of occurrence. the investigating officer has also categorically stated that there was no talk about commission of dacoity when he was in the village conducting the investigation. there was not even a whisper about a dacoity having been committed. no report was made to him about the commission of dacoity. fails to understand why when the investigating officer came to the village of occurrence no reported about the commission of dacoity even if for any reason it was not d earlier. moreover there is evidence on record that no article was removed from the house of $$$. we have therefore no hesitation in rejecting the defence case as fake and an after though. there is no convincing evidence on record which may even probablise the case of dacoity having been committed in the house of $$$ on the day of occurrence. having carefully considered the evidence on record we are satisfied that the conviction of the appellants is fully justified in the facts and circumstances of the case. on the question of sentence it was submitted on behalf of the appellants that this was not appropriate case in which the extreme penalty of death was warranted since this case does not fall in the category of the rarest of rare cases. it is true that as many as innocent lives were lost and the act of the appellants was certainly an inhuman cruel and dastardly act. however aspect of the matter deserves to be mentid while on the question of sentence. it is not disputed that the gift deed was executed sometime in the year which gave rise to strained relationship between $$$ on the hand and $$$ and his sons on the other. there is evidence on record to suggest that several $$$ were held to resolve the dispute. the case of the prosecution is that $$$ even resorted to litigation and instigated $$$ to file a civil suit against his son -in -law for cancellation of the deed of gift. that matter was however compromised and it appears that thereafter cordial relationship prevailed in the family of $$$ minor disputes arose between $$$ and $$$ from time to time. however while all these events took place over years there is not even a suggestion that the appellants ever resorted to violence or that any untoward incident took place in the past. the appellants were no doubt aggrieved but they did not take the law into their hands though they tried all other non violent methods available to them including litigation and $$$. in the background of such facts fails to understand why on the date of occurrence suddenly the appellants decided to do away with all the members of the family. the high court has also considered this aspect of the matter and found that there was nothing to suggest that the crime perpetuated by the appellants was by way of retaliation. the high court is right in making this observation because there is nothing on record to suggest that any untoward incident had taken place on $$$$ before the occurrence which may have aggravated the situation and motivated the appellants to resort to the drastic action of killing all the members of the family of $$$. we have a lurking suspicion that something must have happened on account of which the appellants resorted to the mass killing. the evidence on record does not provide any clue. it may be that the persons who could have thrown some light on this aspect of the matter are not alive to depose and the appellants not willing to say anything on this aspect of the matter lest it may prejudice their defence. we therefore do not have any knowledge about the immediate cause for the occurrence. in this background the question of sentence may be considered. there is no evidence on record to suggest that the appellants are a menace to society as evident by their past deeds. it is not possible to conclude that they are those who can not be reformed or rehabilitated and that they constitute a continuing threat to the society. in fact apart form the incident in question there is not even an allegation about the appellants having indulged in such behavior in the past or having resorted to violence and committed any offence whatsoever. they appear to belong to a middle class farmer family for whom land has great value. but even so there is nothing to suggest that they may repeat such barbarism in future so that they would constitute a continuing threat to the society. having regard to all the facts and circumstances and also having regard to the fact that the evidence does not disclose the immediate cause of the incident we do not find it safe to confirm the sentence of death awarded by the high court to $$$ and $$$. in prakash $$$ patil v. state of maharashtra manu / sc/0788/001manu / sc/0788/001 $$$ the accused gunned down his own brother and his family members and also his mother. the disputes arose on account of the fact that his brother was not willing to partition the joint family properties. this court held that though it was a heinous and brutal crime yet it did not fall in the category of the rarest of rare cases. there was no evidence to support that the appellant in that case was a menace to society. there was also no reason to believe that he could not be reformed or rehabilitate and he was likely to continue his criminal acts of violence as would constitute continuing threat to the society. the facts are somewhat similar in this case and therefore on a careful consideration of all the relevant circumstances were are of the view that the sentence of death is not warranted in this case. we therefore set aside the death sentence awarded by the trial court and confirmed by the high court to appellants $$$ and $$$. we instead sentence them to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life with the condition that they shall not be released before completing an actual term of years including the period already undergone by them. in appropriate cases such sentence has been passed by this court see manu / sc/06/001manu / sc/06/001 $$$ v. state of rajasthan manu / sc/0099/1979manu / sc/0099/1979 $$$ v. state of punjab manu / sc/0788/001manu / sc/0788/001 $$$ prakash $$$ patil v. state of maharashtra. the appeal of ram anup singh calls for no interference. in the result the conviction of the appellants is upheld but the sentence of death awarded to appellants and lallan singh and babban singh is set aside and instead they are sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life as indicated above. subject to the modification in sentence the appeal is dismissed.
