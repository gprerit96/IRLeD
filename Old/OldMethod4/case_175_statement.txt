s.b. sinha j. the appellants herein are successors in interest of late chogyal sir $$$ of $$$. a suit was filed by $$$ tenzing namgyal son of late chogyal palden thondup namgyal and others against the defendants -respondents herein praying for the following reliefs:(a recovery of possession of the encroached portion of the land shown in the annexed plan if required by demolishing the construction made permanent injunction restraining the defendants from using the aforesaid feet wide passage or making any construction whatsoever over the same;(c pending disposal of the suit an order for restraining the defendants from construction of the flyover or blocking the passage and also restraining the defendants from carrying on with further work of construction on the encroached land shown in the attached plan;(d cost of the suit;(e any other relief or reliefs to which the plaintiff may be found entitled to under the law and equity. shortly stated the said suit was filed on the following allegation plot nos. and part situated at gangtok belonged to late chogyal sir $$$ of $$$ were his personal properties forming part of his private estate which upon his death devolved or the original plaintiff and on his death upon the appellants. allegedly pucca building was constructed on plot no. situated at new market road gangtok which was let out to the tenants. on the adjacent land to the same building there existed a private passage of feet width made of steps and further on the adjacent south thereto there was another building known as yuthok building situated on plot no. another passage existed behind the aforesaid buildings which is said to be a private gully being plot no. there are wooden buildings used as kitchen latrines and godown for the use of tenants occupying nayabazar building and yuthok building. allegedly there was a retaining wall on the west of plot no. part which was the boundary between the land of the plaintiffs ' private estate and the land of defendant no.. according to the plaintiffs the defendants started construction of a big pucca building for the purpose of running a hotel on the land situated on the south of his land being plot no. and allegedly the defendants illegally encroached upon about sq. ft. therein. the defendants filed their written statement denying and disputing the allegations made in the plaint. the defendants although admitted the existence of the pucca building and the flight of steps but contended that the latter belonged to gangtok municipality which was meant to serve as the exclusive passage to the plot on which defendant no.had been constructing a multi -storeyed building. it was alleged that beyond the structures of the plaintiffs a precipitated hill edge exists on the eastern boundary of the defendants land and the same was all through in their exclusive possession. the defendants claimed settlement of their land by reason of documents which were marked as exhibits d- d-0 and d- of the years and respectively. the said suit was initially dismissed by the district judge gangtok by a judgment and decree dated $$$$ whereagainst the plaintiffs preferred an appeal before the high court. by a judgment dated.while setting aside the judgment and decree of the learned district judge the matter was remanded with a direction to appoint another commissioner to make local investigation with reference to the cloth survey map and on actual measurement on the spot so as to ascertain the actual area of plot no. the area covered by the denzong cinema the tashik delek hotel and the exact location of all other constructions in a map. an opportunity was also given to the parties to re -examine their witnesses to clear the anomalies indicated in the said judgment. pursuant to or in furtherance of the said direction contained in the said judgment the learned $$$ appointed another commissioner who inter alia found that plot no. measures.acres out of which the land allotted to the defendants was sq. ft. and the total area of construction made by defendant nos. and being the denzong cinema shop houses and hotel comes to.sq. ft.which was accepted by the defendants but according to the plaintiffs the same was.sq.ft. the learned district judge gangtok by a judgment and decree dated.decreed the suit. a division bench of the high court however in appeal reversed the said judgment and decree by a judgment dated 0th june. the appellants are before us in appeal questioning the correctness or otherwise of the said judgment. mr. g.l. sanghi learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants inter alia submitted that the high court committed a serious error in construing the khasra exhibit p- in so far as it held the entries appearing in the name of sir $$$ did not belong to his private estate. the learned counsel would contend that the high court further fell in error in holding that his plot. no. being situated within the bazar area was acquired for a sum of rs. it was submitted that as there had been no transfer of title from the plaintiffs to the private estate in any manner whatsoever the government of $$$ did not derive any title thereto. mr. sanghi would contend that the purported acquisition of the suit land said to have been proved by $$$ $$$ and d-/ does not show that there had been any transfer of property within the meaning of section of the transfer of property act which was applicable to the state of $$$ and in absence thereof the ownership of the plaintiffs in respect of plot nos. and continued with the plaintiffs. drawing our attention to certain findings of the high court in civil appeal no. of the learned counsel would argue that the high court in its judgment arrived at an erroneous conclusion that a private estate had not been mentioned against the plot nos. and in exhibit p- the same had vested in the state of $$$. mr. mitra the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.on the other hand would submit that the conspectus of events found by the high court in the judgment under appeal would clearly establish that the defendants have constructed the hotel building in accordance with the sanction accorded by the competent authorities. it was submitted that most of the documents whereupon reliance had been placed by the high court were produced by the plaintiffs and/or received from the custody of their witnesses. mr. mitra would contend that having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case no presumption can be raised as regards correctness of the entries made in khasra exhibit p-. in support of the said contention strong reliance has been placed on $$$ v. ramchandra nago patil dead by l.rs. and anr. $$$ / sc/0/$$$ / sc/0/. mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.would submit that as in the instant case the plaintiffs have not been able to prove their title over plot no. an independent investigation thereof with reference to the defendants ' title was not necessary. the learned counsel in support of the said contention placed strong reliance on $$$. jind v. $$$ advocate $$$ / sc/00/$$$ / sc/00/. the plaintiff 's predecessor in interest was late chogyal sir $$$ of $$$. there is therefore no question of plaintiff 's having any document of title. the only document of title which was produced by the plaintiff sin support of their claim is the aforementioned khasra exhibit p-. in exhibit p- entries against different plots inter alia have been made in the name of $$$ as also in the name of shri panch maharaja sir $$$ of $$$. certain plots have also been recorded as private estate. plot no. has been recorded in the name of shri panch maharaj sir $$$. plot nos. and have also been recorded in his name. in none of the entries the area of the plots is mentioned. it is relevant to note that the plaintiffs in their plaint claimed ownership in respect of plot. nos. and part. no claim had been made in the plaint that the entire plot no. belonged to the plaintiffs. how the plaintiffs claimed title in respect of a part of plot no. has also not been disclosed. the said khasra was prepared in the year. however admittedly a suggestion to acquire the said land was mooted to the effect that a lump -sum payment may be made to the private estate in lieu of the bazar area with all the income accruing therefrom upon payment of a sum of rs. to the private estate so that the same may vest in $$$. the said proposal was put up for approval and sanction of the chogyal. on nd june the said proposal was accepted. requisite steps for payment of the said amount to the private estate were taken on th june. exhibit d- contains an entry in the cash book of the finance department of $$$ regarding payment of rs. exhibit d- is a classified abstract showing the expenditure of the government of $$$ for the year -regarding payment of rs. both exhibits d- and d- are dated.. the high court recorded a finding to the effect that all lands which were entered in the khasra exhibit p- in the name of sir $$$ did not belong to this private estate. the said finding however may not be correct in view of the fact that admittedly his lands in suit were subject matter of acquisition. we therefore may proceed on the assumption that the said finding of the high court is incorrect. the question which therefore ought to have been raised was not that as to how the said property was treated prior to.but how the said property has been treated thereafter. it is not in dispute that $$$ granted settlement of piece and parcel of land measuring x in favour of the respondent for construction of cinema hall on --. several letters appear to have been passed between the executive officer bazar department of government of $$$ and the respondents herein with regard to the constructions on the said land. admittedly the original plaintiff held share sin denzong cinema limited. it is also beyond any dispute that construction of the cinema hall started in the year. the state of $$$ merged with the union of india in terms of an agreement on april. article of the constitution of india reads thus:" f. special provisions with respect to the state of $$$.--notwithstanding anything in this constitution,-(h all property and assets whether within or outside the territories comprised the state of $$$ which immediately before $$$$ were vested in the government of $$$ or in any other authority or in any person for the purposes of the government of $$$ shall as from $$$$ vest in the government of the state of $$$. after merger of $$$ in the union of india the proposal to construct a hotel started. the records of the case clearly demonstrate that for the purpose of construction of hotel the defendants not only sought for but also were granted additional lands. they took permission for construction of the hotel from the appropriate authorities. in this connection it will be relevant to notice the following important documents:-. --to --. p- p- and p- are extracts taken out from.s. page of file no.--which contain the request of managing director denzong cinema ltd.gangtok for grant

d- is the rough sketch of the site allotted to respondent no.by the government on.and d-3 is the letter from the under secretary. local self government department gangtok to respondent no.forwarding the same to him. the high court discussed the evidence brought on records by the parties in great details. on cogent and sufficient reasons it did not accept the statements of the witnesses examined on behalf of the plaintiffs. relying on or on the basis of various documents it came to the conclusion that even if the private estate said to be belonging to late chogyal had any interest in plot nos. and the same was acquired by the government and thus ceased to be the private estate on and from. the high court further took into consideration various documents as to how the government had treated plot no. as belonging to it and not to the estate both before and after merger of $$$ with government of india. it as noticed hereinbefore further held that the constructions raised by the defendants were within the land settled in favour of the respondents by exhibits d-9 d- and d-11. the high court in its judgment also took into consideration the report of the advocate commissioner and relied thereupon. the plaintiffs claimed title over the suit land on the basis of their title thereupon and not on previous possession. their case thus must stand or fall on their own pleadings. as indicated hereinbefore the plaintiffs proceeded on the basis that they were owners of a part of plot no. they did not specify the extent thereof. they did not say how and to what extent a part of plot no. belonged to them. they did not question the settlements made by $$$ in favour of the respondents and various other persons. in fact the plaintiff 's predecessor held shares in the defendant no.company. in the facts and circumstances of the case it was obligatory on the part of the plaintiffs to prove that the lands allegedly encroached upon by the defendants belonged to them. plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove the same. furthermore indisputably the bazar area had been acquired by $$$. mr. n.k. rustomji who was diwan of $$$ at the relevant time examined himself as witness no. for the plaintiffs. he in no uncertain terms stated:"i understand the meaning of acquisition. the heading of the file as given on page of the note is acquisition of private estate land for gangtok bazar and payment of lumpsum compensation rs. to the private estate. the other documents referred to hereinbefore namely exhibits d-7 d-14 and d-23 to d-23/12 are also clear pointers to the fact that certain properties over which late chogyal of $$$ had been claiming right as its private estate were acquired by $$$ of which he was the head. the owner of the land accepted the amount of compensation without any demur whatsoever and in that view of the matter he as well as his successors in interest are estopped and precluded from contending that the said properties did not vest in $$$ and consequently in the government of india. the submission of mr. sanghi to the effect that the plaintiffs continued to have title in respect of the lands in question despite acquisition thereof must therefore be rejected. it is not sic dispute that $$$ prior to its merger with the union of india was a sovereign state. chogyal was the owner of the entire properties. evidently the lands were recorded in different names. if chogyal of sikkim exercised his right of eminent domain in relation to the suit properties which were said to be belonging to his private estate no registered deed of sale was required to be executed in his favour. in any event once the said lands are held to have vested in $$$ the same consequently vested in the government of sikkim for the purpose of the government. the khasra and khatian have not been prepared under a statute. the question as to whether the same would be historical material or instrument of title or otherwise would depend upon either the statute governing the same or the practice prevailing in the state. in the event however the records of right were not prepared under a statute a presumption of correctness may be raised only in terms of section of the indian evidence act. however ordinarily records of right can not be treated to have any evidentiary value on the question of title inasmuch as such records are prepared mainly based on possession. the entries in the khasra exhibit p- must therefore be construed keeping the aforementioned principles of law in view. in sita ram bhau patil supra this court held:"with regard to the record of rights counsel for the appellant said that presumption arises with regards to its correctness. there is no abstract principle that whatever will appear in the record of rights will be presumed to be correct when it is shown by evidence that the entries are not correct. apart from the intrinsic evidence in the record of rights that they refer to facts which are untrue it also appears that the record of rights have reference to the mutation entry that was made by the circle officer on january. counsel for the respondent rightly contended that no presumption could arise for principal reasons. first the oral evidence in this case nullified the entries in the record of rights as showing a state of affairs opposed to the real state of affairs and no notice was ever given to the respondent with regard to mutation proceedings. therefore the respondent is right in contending that no presumption can validly arise from the record of rights. having regard to the fact that the plaintiffs never claimed any right over the entire plot no. and further having regard to the fact that only a toilet was said to have existed thereupon as also having regard to the subsequent events which took place namely acquisition of land we are of the opinion that the entry in exhibit p-36 is not of much value for the purpose of showing that the plaintiffs continued to have title over the said property. furthermore the plaintiffs claimed title over the suit land. the trial court in a case of this nature was bound to enquire or investigate into the question of title and could not have decreed the suit merely on the basis of the entries in the revenue records see $$$ v. $$$ supra. for the reasons aforementioned we are of the opinion that no case has been made out for our interference with the judgment and decree under appeal. this appeal is therefore dismissed but in the facts and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
