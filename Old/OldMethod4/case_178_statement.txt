g.b. pattanaik j. this appeal is directed against the order dated th june passed in election petition no.of.the aforesaid election petition had been filed by the appellant challenging the validity of the election to the house of people from the bangalore north parliamentary constituency in which election respondent no.was declared to have been elected. in the election petition the election commissir the returning officer and the chief electoral officer of the state of karnataka had been arrayed as respondents and. those respondents filed an application before the high court of karnataka for their deletion inter alia on the ground that under section of the representation of the people act it has been clearly indicated that who should be the parties to an election petition and since they have been unnecessarily impleaded they should be deleted. the high court by the impugned judgment having deleted the said respondents and from the array of parties the present appeal has been preferred. mr. r. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the election petition having been filed. challenging the validity of the election of respondent no.on the grounds contained in section and non -compliance with the provisions of the constitution and the rules by the election machinery having been alleged respondents and at least ought to have been held to be proper parties and there could not have been an order of deletion. according to the learned counsel these respondents and having failed to conform to the mandatory guidelines enacted by the election commission of india as contained in the hand book of the returning officer and those guidelines being treated as an integral part of the rules as well as article of the constitution respondents and became proper parties to the election petition in view of the nature of allegations pertaining to their official conduct. that being the position the learned single judge who was in session of the matter errously deleted the said respondents and. mr. $$$ however seriously does not challenge the order of deletion so far as respondent no.is concerned. mr. s. muralidhar the learned counsel appearing for the election commission on the other hand submitted that the question of parties to an election petition is concluded by earlier decisions of this court in the case of $$$ and ors. v. $$$ and ors. $$$ / sc/01/19$$$$2$$$ / sc/01/19$$$$2. $$$ v. election commission of india and ors. and therefore the high court was wholly justified in directing the deletion of those respondents from the array of parties and by such deletion there has been no illegality requiring interference by this court. mr. muralidhar further contended that the representation of the people act being a full code by itself prescribing the procedure to be followed and indicating the parties to be arrayed to an election petition and respondents and not coming within the ambit of the said provision the high court rightly deleted them and that order need not be interfered with by this court. the learned counsel lastly urged that in view of the nature of allegations made the person making those allegations is required to prove the same and therefore there is no justifiable reason why the election officer or the returning officer should be permitted to be added as a party to the election petition. in order to examine the correctness of the rival submissions it would be necessary for us to have a bird 's eye view of the relevant provisions of the act and the different case laws on the point. but thing must be borne in mind that in the case in hand the allegations made were in relation to the use of voting electoral machines under section the act. the gravamen of the allegations in the election petition are that the returning officer as well as the chief electoral officer had not complied with several provisions of the conduct of election rules and respondents and had not acted in accordance with the guidelines issued by the election commission of india. the relevant paragraphs of the election petition pertaining to the infraction of rules committed by respondent and are paragraphs $$$$ 20d $$$$ and. the representation of the people act referred to as the act is an act providing for the conduct of elections to the house of parliament and to the house of legislature of each state and it provides the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of those houses the corrupt practices and other offences in connection with such elections and the decisions of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with such elections. the general procedure at elections has been enumerated in chapter. section of the act provides the procedure for preventing personation of electors and section which was inserted by act of w.f..deals with voting machines at elections. section provides for declaration of result and section provides for submission of a report of the result to the appropriate authority and the election commission and in case of an election to a house of parliament to the secretary of that house by the returning officer soon after the declaration of the result. it also provides for publication of the name of the elected candidate in the official gazette. part vi starting with section deals with disputes regarding elections. under section of the act no election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this part. presentation of petition is dealt with in section and such petition could be presented on or more of the grounds specified in sub -section of section and section. section stipulates as to who shall join as respondents to an election petition. section may be quoted herein -below in extenso:-"section. parties of the petition:- a petitioner shall join as respondents to his petition---(a where the petitioner in addition to claiming declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void claims a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected all the contesting candidates other than the petitioner and where no such further declaration is claimed all the returned candidates any other candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practice are made in the petition. section provides as to what should contain in an election petition and section in chapter deals with trial of election petitions. section is the procedure for such trial and it provides that every election petition shall be tried as nearly as may be in accordance with the procedure applicable under the code of civil procedure to the trial of suits. as stated earlier section indicates the grounds on which an election can be declared to be void and section indicates the grounds on which a candidate other than the returned candidate may be declared to have been elected. we are not concerned with the other provisions of the act in the case in hand. an appeal to the supreme court has been provided under section. on a plain reading of section which indicates as to the person who can be joined as a respondent to an election petition the conclusion is irresistible that the returned candidate the candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practice have been made are to be joined as party respondent when declaration is sought for holding the election of the returned candidate to be void and when a prayer is made as to any other candidate to be declared to be duly elected then all the contesting candidates are required to be made party respondents. on a literal interpretation of the aforesaid provisions of section it can be said that an election petition which does not make the person enumerated in section of the act as party respondents is liable to be dismissed. the decisions of this court directly on the question are the cases of $$$ and ors. v. $$$ and ors.$$$ / sc/0144/1982$$$ / sc/0144/1982 and b. $$$ v. election commission of india and ors. in the former case $$$ j speaking for the court held that right to elect or to be elected or dispute regarding election are neither fundamental rights nor common law rights but are confined to the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder and consequently rights and remedies are all limited to those provided by the statutory provisions. on the question of joinder of parties referring to section and of the representation of the people act it was held that the contest of the election petition is designed to be confined to the candidates at the election and all others are excluded and therefore only those may be joined as respondents to an election petition who are mentioned in section and and no others. an argument had been advanced in that case that even if somebody may not be a necessary party under section of the act but yet he could be added as a proper party as provided in order i rule of the code of civil procedure. but the court rejected that contention on a finding that the provisions of the civil procedure code apply to election disputes only as far as may be and subject to the provisions of the act and any rules made thereunder and the provisions of the code can not be invoked to permit which is not permissible under the act. it was in that context the court further observed that the concept of proper parties is and remain alien to an election dispute under the act. this decision was followed in b. $$$ 's case $$$ / $$$ / sc/0415/1991 referred to supra and it was reiterated that the concept of proper party is and must remain alien to an election dispute under the act and only those may be joined as respondents to an election petition who are mentioned in section and of the act and no others. the court in this case added that however desirable and expedient it may appear to be non -else shall be joined as respondents. mr. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant contended that the law enunciated in the decisions and the observations made are too wide and while section casts an obligation on an election petitioner to join those mentioned in clauses(a and as partly respondent it does not put an embargo for addition of any other person in an appropriate case depending upon the nature of allegation made and consequently the expression any other in the decisions referred to above must be held not to have been correctly used. mr. $$$ relied upon the observations made by this court in m.s. $$$ 's case $$$ / sc/0209/1977$$$ / sc/0209/1977 wherein the court had observed that the constitution contemplates a free and fair election and vests comprehensive responsibilities of superintendence direction and control of the conduct of elections in the election commission. this responsibility may cover powers duties and functions of many sorts administrative or other depending on the circumstances and submitted that the basis of electoral democracy being a free and fair election and fairness imports an obligation to see that no wrong- doer candidate benefits from his own wrong. in case where allegations are made against the returning officer or the chief electoral officer with regard to the conduct of the election there should be no bar to array them as parties and according to mr. $$$ in $$$ 's case the chief election commissioner was a party and therefore this court in $$$ as well as the subsequent case having not noticed the aforesaid judgment of the larger bench the latter decision will be of no assistance. we are not in a position to accept the submission of mr. $$$ inasmuch as in $$$ 's case an order of the election commissioner was under challenge by filing a writ petition and it was not an election petition under the provisions of the representation of the people act. there is no dispute with the proposition that a free and fair electoral process is the foundation of our democracy but the question for consideration is whether by indicating in the act as to who shall be arrayed as party the court would be justified in allowing some others as parties to an election petition. for the aforesaid proposition $$$ 's case is no authority. mr. venkataramani then relied upon the decision of calcutta high court in $$$ v. hare krishna konar $$$ / wb/0044/193$$$ / wb/0044/193 air193cal218 air193cal218 where the question came up for consideration directly and the calcutta high court did observe that the returning officer may nevertheless in an appropriate case be a proper party who may be added as party to the election petition and undoubtedly the aforesaid observation supports the contention of mr. venkararamani. following the aforesaid decision a learned single judge of the bombay high court in the case of h.r. gokhale v. $$$. and ors. $$$ / mh/001/199$$$ / mh/001/199 air199bom177 air199bom177 had also observed that the observations of shah j in ram sewak yadav 's case $$$ / sc/0177/194$$$ / sc/0177/194 in paragraph is not intended to lay down that the returning officer can in no event to be a proper party to an election petition. but both these aforesaid decisions of the calcutta high court and bombay high court had been considered by this court in $$$ case and the court took the view that the public policy and legislative wisdom both seem to point to an interpretation of the provisions of the representation of the people act which does not permit the joining as parties of persons other than those mentioned in section and. the court also in paragraph 12)considered the consequences if persons other than those mentioned in section are permitted to be added as parties and held that the necessary consequences would be an unending disorderly election dispute with no hope of achieving the goal contemplated by section of the act. in the aforesaid premises we reiterate the views taken by this court in jyoti basu ' case and reaffirmed in the letter case in b. $$$ and we see no infirmity with the impugned judgment requiring our interference under article of the constitution. this appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.
