anil r. $$$ j.this appeal has been filed against the judgment delivered on th november in r.s.a. no. of by the high court of karnataka at bangalore. the facts giving rise to the present appeal in a nutshell are as under the $$$ is the original defendant in the suit. the $$$ who are respondents herein had filed a suit for partition and separate possession of the share in the suit property. the property in question originally belonged to late $$$ whose wife $$$ had died and thereafter he had married roshanbi. out of the marriage with halimabi late $$$ had children and of them had died whereas he had children through his marriage with roshanbi. the suit was filed by the wife and her children against the defendant who is the heir of the wife. the suit was in respect of property which was purchased by $$$ and the suit property was in occupation of all the family members. the suit being o.s. no. of was decreed on 2th july. the said judgment and decree had been challenged by way of an appeal and the said appeal was dismissed on th november by the appellate court. being aggrieved by the said judgment an appeal was filed in the high court. the high court had allowed the appeal by remanding the matter to the appellate court for its fresh disposal with a direction to permit the parties to lead documentary evidence in relation to a memorandum of partition dated th august. in pursuance of the order of the high court the appellate court had permitted production of the aforestated document $$$. d dated th august which is in a nature of a memorandum of partition whereby during the lifetime of $$$ the property in question had been divided among the children of the wife and the wife. in pursuance of the aforestated document necessary revenue entries were made whereby the property bearing cts no. was divided into cts no. and cts no. the aforestated facts are not in dispute and it is also an admitted fact that the eastern part of the property cts no. 3/b was in possession of the $$$ i. the children of the wife as well as late $$$ whereas the western part of the property cts no. was in occupation of the son of the wife. the appellate court considered the validity of the aforestated document dated th august and came to the conclusion that the property had been divided earlier which was recorded under a document dated august which was duly signed by late $$$ and the document had also been attested by independent witnesses. unfortunately neither $$$ nor the attesting witnesses were alive at the time when the said document was exhibited as $$$. d. the said document was believed by the lower appellate court and on the basis of the evidence which had been adduced in addition to the aforestated document the appellate court had set aside the decree passed by the trial court and held that the property had been divided during the lifetime of late $$$ and therefore the $$$ were not entitled to share in the suit premises which consisted of cts no. and cts no. according to the lower appellate court the property had been duly divided and was in occupation of the respective parties even during the lifetime of late $$$. the said judgment dated 1st april delivered by the lower appellate court in regular appeal no. had been challenged before the high court in regular second appeal no. which had been allowed by the high court and therefore this appeal has been filed. the high court did not agree with the view expressed by the lower appellate court mainly on the ground that $$$. d had not been registered as it ought to have been registered as it was compulsorily registrable. the high court was also of the view that $$$. d was not produced at the time when the trial was conducted and the said document had not been relied upon by the defendant at the time of the trial though he was in possession of the said document. moreover the high court was of the view that there is no concept of joint family in muslims and therefore there could not have been any partition or joint family property among the $$$ and the defendant who belong to the family of $$$. the learned counsel appearing for the $$$ i. the original defendant submitted that the high court committed an error by not relying upon the document $$$. d dated th august. he submitted that the said document was executed by $$$ giving details with regard to his family and giving a portion of his property bearing no. cts to the son of his wife and another portion of the property to the children of his wife. $$$ had continued to stay with his wife and children of the wife in the property which was subsequently numbered as cts. he also submitted that division of the property among the children of wives was duly recorded in ex. d which was executed by late $$$ and the said document which was presented after years was admissible as per the provisions of the indian evidence act and there was no reason to disbelieve the said document. moreover the learned counsel drew our attention to certain admitted facts pertaining to admission by the plaintiffs with regard to their approaching independent persons when a dispute had been raised with regard to possession of the suit property. there was an evidence to show that some understanding was arrived at earlier among the family members which was reflected in ex. d which was duly acted upon and therefore it was submitted by the learned counsel that there was no reason for the high court to take a different view than the one which was taken by the lower appellate court. on the other hand the learned counsel appearing for the respondents / original plaintiffs submitted that the document ex. d had not been produced by the defendant at the time of the trial though he was in possession thereof and there was no justifiable reason for not producing the said document at the time of the trial. moreover he submitted that the said document ought to have been registered but since it was not registered it ought not to have been relied upon by the lower appellate court and the high court was justified in ignoring the said document. no other submission was made by the learned counsel.we have heard the learned counsel and have perused the impugned judgment and the evidence recorded by the courts below. upon perusal of the evidence we are of the view that the lower appellate court was correct in its conclusion that late $$$ had made arrangements with regard to his property during his lifetime and the said arrangements had been subsequently recorded in ex. d which had been duly acted upon by the revenue authorities by dividing the suit property into different parts namely cts no. and cts no. it is not in dispute that the property which had been divided by late $$$ was in occupation of the respective parties and the said fact has also been recorded in the revenue record. it is true that there is no concept of joint family in muslims but it was open to late $$$ to give his property to his children in a particular manner during his lifetime which he rightly did so as to avoid any dispute which could have arisen after his death. the arrangement so made was duly accepted by the family members and it was also acted upon. only thereafter a formal record of the said fact was made by late shaikaji in ex. d.. in our opinion genuineness of ex. d7 was rightly not questioned by the lower appellate court and the high court was not correct when it questioned its legality and validity especially when the plaintiffs had filed a suit after more than years of the aforestated understanding which had taken place during or prior to. for the reasons stated hereinabove and more particularly those stated by the lower appellate court we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment delivered by the high court so as to give effect to the judgment and decree passed by the lower appellate court.thus the appeal stands disposed of as allowed with no orders as to costs.
