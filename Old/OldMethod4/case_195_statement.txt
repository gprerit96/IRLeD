$$$ j. the present set of appeals arise out of the common judgment and order dated.of the high court of judicature of patna in criminal appeal nos. and of whereby the high court reversed the trial courts judgments and acquitted all the accused persons in this case. earlier the additional sessions judge vaishali at hajipur being the trial court in the present matter had convicted accused persons for the offence under section b of the indian penal code and senced them to rigorous imprisonment for years. before venturing into the facts of the case it would be expedient to mention the names of the persons involved in this case which are as follows deceased raj banshi deviaccused $$$ $$$ husband of the deceased)(ii $$$ mother -in -law of the deceased -died during the trial of the case)(iii $$$ sister -in -law of the deceased)(iv $$$ father -in -law of the deceased)(v $$$ husband of $$$)(vi deobanti devi sister of $$$ $$$ husband of $$$ $$$ alleged wife of $$$ $$$ father of $$$)(x $$$ close relation of $$$)prosecution witnesses $$$ kumarmunsi lalmahendra rai$$$ yadav brother of the deceased)3. the facts as per the prosecution story are that raj banshi devi now deceased was married to $$$ on.. within months of marriage the in -laws of the deceased started torturing her and making dowry demands of a rajdoot motorcycle and a television. allegedly the deceased was also threaed to be assaulted and killed and she was told that $$$ would marry somebody else. the informant $$$ has stated that whenever he visited the deceased she informed him of the harassment that she suffered at the hands of her in -laws. he took her sister back to her parental home in december on her insisce since she feared of being killed. later on learning that $$$ was going to marry $$$ daughter of $$$ $$$ took his sister now deceased to her matrimonial home on --. the deceased was allegedly bea up and turned out of home by her in -laws. she again went to her matrimonial home on --. however she was again badly assaulted and bea up for not fulfilling the dowry demands on.. after this incident the deceased had filed a complaint before the chief judicial magistrate vaishali against the accused persons under sections of indian penal code and sections and of dowry prohibition act. it is the further case of the prosecution that in october the accused persons called $$$ to their house and made explicit demands of a rajdoot motorcycle and a television and threaed him of facing the death of his sister. on.in $$$ the informant received the news of his sister 's death and he went to her matrimonial house where he found her sister died of burn injuries. he filed an fir and the police conducted investigation thereupon. during the trial the prosecution produced witnesses out of persons named in the charge -sheet. it appears that prosecution missed out to examine either parents of the deceased and curiously persons being $$$ and $$$ who were cited as prosecution witnesses in the charge -sheet were produced as defence witnesses. if this was not enough to show poor way of conducting the prosecution there is another strikingly disturbing fact that neither the doctor who conducted post -mortem nor the investigating officer was brought on record as witness. pw-1 $$$ appears to be a hearsay witness as he says that he was told by $$$ that the accused persons had bea up the deceased and set her on fire. even pw2 awadhesh rai says that he had g to $$$ 's house on the date of incident i..when $$$ told him that the accused persons had bea up the deceased and that she was killed. he further states that he had seen the dead body of the deceased and it had scars all over the body and both the knees were tied up with iron wire. the testimony of the informant $$$ pw-5 is vital as he is the brother of the deceased. he has stated that the incident occurred on intervening.and.. he received the information of death of his sister in of.and went to her place. he found large assemblage of people outside the house. on going inside the house he found the dead body of his sister which was covered with pink colour terrycot saree. on removing the saree he found both her hands were tied with iron wire and flesh of both the hands was reddish while neck also appeared to be tied with something. on enquiring from the crowd assembled outside the house he learnt that at around pm all the accused persons were making conversations inside the house and even sound of crying was heard. people also told him that in the morning when the accused persons were trying to dispose of the dead body the village chowkidar had seen them so they all fled away. he has further testified to the harassment met out with the deceased after her marriage at the hands of the accused persons. he deposed with respect to the dowry demands which we have already recorded in the alleged facts from the side of prosecution and for the sake of brevity we are not repeating them. he has further deposed that.he had g to $$$ who is the father of $$$ to whom $$$ was rumored to marry soon. he had requested $$$ not to let his daughter marry $$$ as it would ruin the life of his sister now deceased but it was dismissed by $$$. later he learnt that $$$ was marrying $$$ and so he had taken his sister now deceased to her matrimonial house and due to this reason the marriage was postpd from.to..thereafter it is alleged that $$$ did marry $$$ however no conclusive proof is brought fore to prove this fact. apart from oral testimony we find that there is a letter dated.writ in handwriting of the deceased and signature of the deceased to her brother $$$ wherein she has expressed her fears of being killed by her in -laws if the demands of dowry were not met. she mentions in that letter about a past incident when she was given poison in her food but she threw away the food. this letter was proved by pw-5 as the that he received from his sister. the medical evidence in this case is the post -mortem report. the post -mortem report reveals that there are numerous ante mortem injuries. ribs in chest are found fractured by some hard and blunt object and that there are superficial burn injuries all over the body deep at only a small portion of front neck. the cause of death as per the post -mortem report appears to be shock due to burn injuries. the defence has not come up with a substantial case of its own except claiming that the deceased was not murdered but she caught fire from a stove while cooking food. the defence has conded various lacunae in the case of the prosecution. they have relied heavily on the non -examination of important witnesses in this case. but besides this the defence has failed to explain any other circumstance surrounding the death of the deceased or the circumstances after her death. we have analysed the evidence produced in this case. we find that although the case of the prosecution suffers from many infirmities and there has been unexplained reluctance in bringing the relevant witnesses on record apart from parents of the deceased the doctor and the investigating officer even $$$ and the chowkidar who saw the accused persons disposing of the body of the deceased have also not been examined. yet we may not lose sight of the fact that this is the case of dowry death. even with the limited evidence brought on record certain things have been established. it is undisputed that the deceased had died during .due to burn injuries inside her matrimonial house. it further appears that when pw-5 informant arrived at the house on $$$$ of the incident the house was deserted except that her sister 's dead body was lying. these are extremely incriminating circumstances as in normal course the dead body would not have been abandd like this. further there are ante mortem injuries found on the body of the deceased which shows that there was some physical assault on her before she died. this is further established by the fact that her knees were tied with an iron wire even after death. we find this indicates that the deceased was not only physically assaulted which caused her ribs to fracture but she was also tied up with iron wire so as to make her immobile and thereafter she was set on fire. the demands of dowry are proved sufficiently by pw-5 and the letter that the deceased had writ to clearly shows that the demands of dowry were not only made but even cruelty in relation to those demands was committed. the deceased had expressed in the letter her apprehension of being killed. the complaint to the chief judicial magistrate under sections of indian penal code and sections and of dowry prohibition act goes on to further indicate that dowry related cruelty was committed against the deceased. the deceased was married to accused $$$ on.which means the death of the deceased occurred within a little over years of the marriage. we find that the main ingredients of section 304b of indian penal code have been proved to trigger the presumption under section of the evidence act. the death has occurred within years of the marriage due to burn injuries and there were demands of dowry accompanied with the physical and mental cruelty against the deceased prior to her death. the post -mortem report has revealed the physical assault on her just before her death. therefore we find that the burden of proof must shift on the accused persons to explain the death of the deceased. the defence has made a cursory statement that the deceased caught fire from stove while cooking food. there is no explanation as to why the deceased was not taken to hospital or why was the dead body left unatded to in the morning. the entire conduct of the accused persons is very suspicious and non -explanation of same means they have not discharged their burden of proof. however we must focus our attion to the fact that there are accused persons in this case of them died during the pendency of trial and it has not been proved conclusively or even sufficiently that all of the accused were present in the house when the deceased died. since we are proceeding on a presumption we must be cautious in attaching the guilt to the accused persons whose presence itself can be doubted at the place of incident. in the present case $$$ her father $$$ and $$$ are not members of this family and they had no reason to be present at the house of $$$ when the deceased died due to burn injuries. similar is the case of dholan devi and deobanti devi sisters of $$$ and their husbands $$$ and $$$. those persons did not use to live in the house of $$$ and they used to stay in a different village. there is no evidence to the effect that these accused persons were in that house when the incident occurred. therefore we do not find it prudent to attach guilt to them in absence of any such evidence. with respect to the other accused persons i. $$$ and his father $$$ who were ordinarily residents in the house where the deceased died of burn injuries neither of the accused persons has offered any reasonable explanation as to how did the deceased suffer the ante mortem injuries and died due to burn injuries. in these circumstances we find the accused persons being $$$ and $$$ as guilty for commission of crime. accordingly the judgment and order of the trial court so far as it convicted and sentenced $$$ and $$$ is restored and the appeals are allowed to this extent. $$$ and $$$ shall be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the sentence. hon'ble mr. justice $$$ ghose pronounced the reportable judgment of the bench comprising his lordship and hon'ble mr. justice $$$ umesh lalit. the appeals are allowed in terms of the signed reportable judgment as follows accordingly the judgment and order of the trial court so far as it convicted and sentenced $$$ and $$$ is restored and the appeals are allowed to this extent. $$$ and $$$ shall be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the sentence.
