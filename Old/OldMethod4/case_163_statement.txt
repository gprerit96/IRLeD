state council of higher education hereinafter referred to as the apsc was constituted under section of the $$$ state council of higher education act to advise the state government in matters relating

wrote $$$ no. -dated.to the principal secretary to government higher education ue department $$$ outlining a provisional allocation of assets as well as posts between the states in terms of the

management of the banks in which the bank accounts of the government were operating to ensure that the provisions of the reorganization act especially with respect to the institutions listed in schedules vii ix and x were not violated. on.tsc sent a communication to the manager $$$ saifabad hyderabad branch stating that tsc is the successor organization to apsc as per the reorganisation act and requested the bank to freeze the operation of account no. and all other accounts operating in the name of apsc. the bank sent a letter dated.to apsc informing them about the letter from tsc. in its reply dated.apsc denied that tsc was its successor and informed the bank that if it were to freeze its accounts it would be constrained to take the appropriate legal action. accordingly the bank sent a letter dated.to the tsc declining to freeze the accounts of apsc. on.the state bank of hyderabad $$$ hyderabad branch without giving prior notice to apsc froze the accounts at the behest of tsc. $$$ of the said action of the bank in freezing the accounts apsc filed $$$ no. of before the high court of $$$ praying for the action of the state bank of hyderabad $$$ hyderabad branch in freezing the accounts of apsc to be declared as illegal arbitrary and contrary to the principles of natural justice and setting it aside. the state of telangana also filed writ petition no. of praying for a declaration that apsc and the state of $$$ be not allowed to withdraw my from the bank accounts of apsc. by way of the impugned common judgment and order dated.the high court held that tsc would be allowed to operate the concerned bank accounts and that the claim made by apsc was not sustainable since it was now located in the state of telangana. the high court held as under:6. it is the settled position of law that institutions located in the successor states are governed by the law of successor state -laws of the land namely principle of land known as lex situs. under article & of the constitution of india the state legislatures are competent to make laws in respect of their territory covered by the entries in list -ii & of the schedule of the constitution. therefore in terms of section of the act the specified institutions under the schedule are governed by the laws of the respective states where they are located. having regard to the aforesaid legal position the institutions specified in the schedule located in telangana are governed by the law of the state of telangana..the office of institution of petitir no. formerly known as apsc is now situated in the state of telangana at hyderabad. therefore the law enacted by the state of telangana al necessarily has application for administration of the institution. consequently any action taken or order now passed by the erstwhile body of the institution specified at item no. of schedule is without jurisdiction and would be ultra vires. the apsc at the instance of the state of $$$ is now asserting its power and authority and physically occupying the premises without any authority of law. the apsc is not entitled to operate the bank accounts or withdraw any amount. notwithstanding the aforesaid legal status even after nd june the apsc has withdrawn considerable amounts from the state bank of hyderabad $$$ in respect of the above saving bank accounts. as such the petitir no. wrote a letter to the state bank of hyderabad and $$$ for freezing of the said accounts. accordingly a decision was taken by the bank and rightly so.emphasis laid by this court)on the question of ownership and control of the erstwhile apsc the high court held as $$$. on a fair reading of section of the act as correctly contended by the learned a.g. for the state of telangana the state of $$$ is a mere user of the city of hyderabad for a maximum period of years. it has no proprietary right title and interest in this city and n of the assets which belong to the erstwhile state of $$$ located at hyderabad can be claimed by the state of $$$ except in accordance with the act..xxx0..because of the adaptation with amendments in the eye of law apsc has no existence at least in hyderabad or in any part of telangana state.. under such circumstances the assets and properties and funds whatever lying at the present location of the apsc belong to tsc.the high court held that the claim made by apsc is not sustainable in law and that present tsc be allowed to operate the bank accounts of the erstwhile apsc. hence the present appeals filed by the state of $$$ and apsc. mr. p.p. rao learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the apsc contends that it is essential to understand the correct purport of section of the reorganisation act. section extracted above deals only with the continuance of facilities in respect of the institutions specified in the tenth schedule. it can by no means be stretched to deal with either apportionment of assets and liabilities of the institutions specified in tenth schedule of the reorganisation act or allocation of the institutions to state or the other. the learned senior counsel contends that the assets and liabilities of the existing state are dealt with in part -vi consisting $$$ -of the reorganisation act under heading apportionment of assets and liabilities.section of the reorganisation act reads as under:. the provisions of this part shall apply in relation to the apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the existing state of $$$ immediately before the appointed day.xxx( the apportionment of assets and liabilities shall be subject to such financial adjustment as may be necessary to secure just reasonable and equitable apportionment of the assets and liabilities amongst the successor states.any dispute regarding the amount of financial assets and liabilities shall be settled through mutual agreement failing which by order by the central government on the advice of the $$$ and auditor -general of india.emphasis laid by this court)further section which deals with treasury and bank balances reads as under:9. the total of the cash balances in all treasuries of the existing state of $$$ and the credit balances of the existing state of $$$ with the reserve bank of india the state bank of india or any other bank immediately before the appointed day shall be divided between the states of $$$ and telangana on the basis of population ratio..population ratio has been defined in section as under:.population ratio in relation to the states of $$$ and telangana means the ratio of.as per censusthe learned senior counsel contends that the assets of apsc need to be divided in the population ratio between the successor states of $$$ and telangana in a fair and equitable manner. mr. basava prabhu s. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the state of $$$ contends that the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court is errous in law. the learned senior counsel contends that the funds collected by apsc post the creation of telangana i.post.can not be appropriated by the state of telangana simply by way of the order of the high court on the basis of faulty interpretation of the provisions of the reorganisation act. it is submitted that this has effectively resulted in the state of telangana stopping the state of $$$ from utilising the funds it had collected even post the bifurcation in respect of the districts which formed part of its territory. the learned senior counsel further draws our attention to section of the reorganisation act which reads as under:6. residuary provision the benefit or burden of any asset or liability of the existing state of $$$ not dealt with in the foregoing provisions of this part shall pass to the state of $$$ in the instance subject to such financial adjustment as may be agreed upon between the states of $$$ and telangana or in default of such agreement as the central government may by order direct.emphasis laid by this court)1. the learned senior counsel further contends that the impugned judgment and order has been passed on a faulty consideration of the provisions of sections and of the reorganisation act and in ignorance and non consideration of the provisions of part vi of the act which deal with apportionment of assets and liabilities. the learned senior counsel contends that the overarching principle of the reorganisation act is a basis of bifurcation namely reasonableness and equity and population ratio and the same must be implemented in its true spirit. on the other hand mr. t.r. $$$ the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the state of telangana contends that the term facilities used in section of the reorganisation act should also be understood to include assets and liabilities of those respective institutions. if an institution falls within the territory of telangana then it can not be disturbed and the new state of $$$ can not stake any claim in it whatsoever. mr. k. $$$ learned advocate general for the state of telangana contends that the specified institutions in the schedule of the reorganisation act are partly corporate personalities in the nature of state owned institutions without any commercial element and are non -profit in nature. the learned advocate general places reliance on the decision of this court in the case of electricity employees union v. union of india manu / sc/058/$$$$manu / sc/058/$$$$ scc wherein this court while interpreting the provisions of the punjab reorganisation act held as under:11. part vi of the act as stated above deals with apportionment of assets and liabilities of the erstwhile state of punjab. this part is not applicable for apportionment of assets and liabilities of the existing punjab state electricity board as there is specific provision for this purpose viz.section and moreover the board has a separate legal entity. further the learned advocate general contends that the apportionment of assets and liabilities as per the reorganisation act has been made on the basis of territory and location. the tenth schedule state institutions have to be maintained as per the location of the respective states. thus purely on the basis of the principle of territoriality also the funds and assets of the erstwhile apsc now belong to the tsc. mr. $$$ the learned solicitor general appearing on behalf of union of india submits that apsc is a statutory body constituted under the $$$ state council for higher education act. since the council has to discharge statutory responsibilities under the relevant act both the states should adopt the act of under section of the reorganisation act in the interest of students till such time as they enact their own laws. while the government of telangana has already adopted this the government of $$$ is still to do so. the learned solicitor general further submits that the ownership and division of the assets of the erstwhile apsc would be governed by section of the reorganisation act. the learned solicitor general draws our attention to a crucial provision which governs the assets and liabilities of the institutions incorporated under central or state act i. section which reads as under:5( where anybody corporate constituted under a central act state act or provincial act for the existing state of $$$ or any part thereof has by virtue of the provisions of part ii become an inter -state body corporate the investments in or loans or advances to any such body corporate by the existing state of $$$ made before the appointed day shall save as otherwise expressly provided by or under this act be divided between the states of $$$ and telangana in the same proportion in which the assets of the body corporate are divided under the provisions of this part.emphasis laid by this court)the learned solicitor general further submits that since all statutory corporations and public sector undertakings are the instrumentalities created by the existing state of $$$ in the context of reorganization of the existing state their assets and liabilities are liable to be apportid between the states as per the population ratio stipulated under the provisions of section of the reorganisation act. the apsc being an asset of the existing state created by the act of it became necessary to provide for bifurcation of apsc and allocation of fixed deposits bank balances cadre strength vehicles equipment movable assets etc. the learned senior counsel submits that subsequent to the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court tsc has been operating the bank accounts of apsc which includes the my collected from the districts of the successor state of $$$. we have heard the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the parties. the short point which arises for our consideration is whether the high court was right in upholding the action of the $$$ in freezing the accounts of apsc. we are unable to agree with the contentions advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing for the state of telangana. the constitution of india envisages a federal feature which has been held to be a part of the basic structure of the constitution of india as has been held by the judge $$$ of this court in the case of s.r. bommai and ors. v. union of india manu / sc/0/$$$$manu / sc/0/$$$$ scc wherein justice k. $$$ in his concurring opinion elaborated as under:7. federalism envisaged in the constitution of india is a basic feature in which the union of india is permanent within the territorial limits set in article of the constitution and is indestructible. the state is the creature of the constitution and the law made by $$$ to with no territorial integrity but a permanent entity with its boundaries alterable by a law made by parliament. neither the relative importance of the legislative entries in schedule vii lists i and of the constitution nor the fiscal control by the union per se are decisive to conclude that the constitution is unitary. the respective legislative powers are traceable to $$$ to of the constitution. the state qua the constitution is federal in structure and independent in its exercise of legislative and executive power. however being the creature of the constitution the state has no right to secede or claim sovereignty. qua the union state is quasi -federal. both are coordinating institutions and ought to exercise their respective powers with adjustment understanding and accommodation to render socio -economic and political justice to the people to preserve and elongate the constitutional goals including secularism. the preamble of the constitution is an integral part of the constitution. democratic form of government federal structure unity and integrity of the nation secularism socialism social justice and judicial review are basic features of the constitution.emphasis laid by this court)1. article of the constitution of india confers the power of formation of new states on the parliament. the scope of article was elaborated upon by a judge bench of this court in the case of $$$ v. $$$ $$$ / sc/041/$$$$manu / sc/041/$$$$ scc as under india is an indestructible union of destructible units. article and article of the constitution together empower parliament to make laws to form a new state by separation of the territory from any state or by uniting or more states or parts of states or by uniting any territory to a part of any state and in so doing to increase or diminish the area of any state and to alter its boundaries... the issue of bifurcation of states is both sensitive as well as tricky. adequate care has to be taken by the legislature while drafting legislations such as the reorganisation act to ensure a smooth division of all assets liabilities and funds between the states to make sure that the interests of the citizens living in these states are protected adequately. therefore care must be taken to ensure that no discrimination is d against either of the successor state. thus while interpreting statutes of such nature the courts must ensure that all parts of the statute are given effect to. an judge $$$ of this court in the case of h.h. maharajadhiraja madhav rao jivaji rao scindia bahadur of gwalior and ors. v. union of india manu / sc/0050/1970manu / sc/0050/1970 scc has held as under the court will interpret a statute as far as possible agreeably to justice and reason and that in case of or more interpretations which is more reasonable and just will be adopted for there is always a presumption against the law maker intending injustice and unreason. the court will avoid imputing to the legislature an intention to enact a provision which flouts notions of justice and norms of fairplay unless a contrary intention is manifest from words plain and unambiguous. a provision in a statute will not be construed to defeat its manifest purpose and general values which animate its structure. in an avowedly democratic polity statutory provisions ensuring the security of fundamental human rights including the right to property will unless the contrary mandate be precise and unqualified be construed liberally so as to uphold the right. these rules apply to the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions alike.emphasis laid by this court)3. in the case of $$$ @ $$$ v. state of gujarat manu / sc/0030/$$$$manu / sc/0030/$$$$ scc a constitution bench of this court held as under by now it is well settled principle of law that no part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place. it is also trite that the statute or rules made thereunder should be read as a whole and provision should be construed with reference to the other provision to make the provision consistent with the object sought to be achieved.in reserve bank of india v. peerless general finance and investment co. ltd. this court said:33. interpretation must depend on the text and the context. they are the basis of interpretation. one may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour. neither can be ignored. both are important. that interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. a statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. with this knowledge the statute must be read as a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word. if a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute -maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. with these glasses we must look at the act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire act. no part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.emphasis laid by this court)24. it is natural that when an existing state if bifurcated to form new states there must be an equitable bifurcation of the assets and liabilities of the statutory bodies among the successor states as well to ensure welfare of the public at large residing within these territories. in the instant case the state of telangana has claimed ownership over the entire funds and assets of the erstwhile apsc. this could surely not have been the intention of the legislature while enacting the reorganisation act. the main thrust of the argument of both the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of state of telangana as well as the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court is that the successor state of $$$ has absolutely no right over the institutions in the city of hyderabad by virtue of the fact that hyderabad falls in the successor state of telangana. heavy reliance has also been placed on section of the reorganisation act on the ground that the assets belonging to the specified institutions of the tenth schedule exclusively belong to the state institutions since the act does not provide any apportionment to them. we are wholly unable to agree with this contention advanced on behalf of the state of telangana. if this contention is accepted it would render section of the act which provides for the apportionment of assets and liabilities among the successor states useless and nugatory. the action of the banks of freezing the bank accounts of apsc is wholly untenable in law which must be set aside. by no stretch of imagination can it be assumed that the complete takeover of assets of the erstwhile apsc by tsc on the ground that the state institution happens to be in hyderabad which is now a part of telangana was what the legislature had in contemplation while enacting the reorganisation act. for the reasons stated supra the common impugned judgment and order passed by the high court of judicature at hyderabad for the states of telangana and $$$ in writ petition nos. and of upholding the freezing of the bank accounts of apsc being unsustainable in law is liable to be set aside and set aside. accordingly the appeals filed by the state of $$$ and apsc are allowed. having allowed the appeal filed by apsc we also hold that the action of freezing of the bank accounts of apsc is bad in law on account of the fact that what has been frozen is not just the pre bifurcation amount but also the amounts collected by apsc for the period after the bifurcation in relation to the districts of the successor state of $$$. accordingly apsc must be allowed to operate their bank accounts in respect of the districts which fall within state of $$$ now in which the amounts collected post the date of bifurcation have been deposited. the assets of apsc of the undivided state of $$$ that is assets existing up to the date of bifurcation may be divided between the successor states in the population ratio of as provided under section of the reorganisation act if the successor states are agreeable to the same. if the successor states are unable to arrive at an agreement the central government may constitute a committee which may be directed to arrive at an agreement in accordance with the provisions of the reorganisation act within $$$$ months from the date such representation is made to the central government. all pending applications are disposed of. no costs.
