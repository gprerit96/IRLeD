could	O
be	O
examined	O
as	O
an	O
eye	B-LEG
witness	I-LEG
.	O

It	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
the	O
occurrence	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
witnessed	O
by	O
a	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
belonging	O
to	O
village	O
Dilman	O
Chapra	O
since	O
it	O
took	O
place	O
between	O
6.30	O
and	O
6.45	O
a.m.	O
in	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
the	O
village	O

However	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
village	O
relationship	O
their	O
reluctance	O
to	O
depose	O
against	O
the	O
appellants	O
can	O
be	O
well	O
appreciated	O
.	O

The	O
co-villagers	O
perhaps	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
themselves	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O
affair	O
.	O

The	O
eye	B-LEG
witnesses	O
no	O
doubt	O
belong	O
to	O
village	O
Jamunia	O
Jasauli	O
but	O
one	O
can	O
not	O
ignore	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Jamunia	O
Jasauli	O
is	O
at	O
a	O
distant	O
of	O
only	O
half	O
a	O
kilometer	O
from	O
village	O
Dilman	O
Chapra	O

On	O
the	O
request	O
of	O
Madan	O
Singh	O
(	O
deceased	O
)	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
persuasion	O
of	O
the	O
informant	O
these	O
witnesses	O
had	O
come	O
to	O
take	O
part	O
in	O
the	O
Panchayati	O
to	O
be	O
held	O
that	O
morning	O
.	O

They	O
can	O
not	O
therefore	O
be	O
described	O
as	O
mere	O
chance	O
witnesses	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
come	O
to	O
that	O
village	O
with	O
a	O
purpose	O
and	O
were	O
not	O
mere	O
passers	O
by	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
found	O
their	O
deposition	O
to	O
be	O
convincing	O
and	O
truthful	O

20	O
.	O

The	O
consistency	O
in	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
witnesses	O
is	O
also	O
understandable	O
in	O
the	O
facts	O
of	O
this	O
case	O
.	O

The	O
witnesses	O
were	O
known	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
they	O
also	O
knew	O
the	O
appellants	O
and	O
their	O
victims	O
.	O

The	O
occurrence	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
sufficient	O
light	O
to	O
enable	O
the	O
witnesses	O
to	O
identify	O
the	O
appellants	O
and	O
the	O
deceased	O
.	O

The	O
assault	B-LEG
on	O
the	O
victims	O
was	O
not	O
simultaneous	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
shot	O
dead	O
one	O
after	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

The	O
witnesses	O
were	O
only	O
10	O
to	O
15	O
steps	O
behind	O
the	O
assailants	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
therefore	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
notice	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
occurrence	O
took	O
place	O
and	O
the	O
role	O
played	O
by	O
the	O
appellants	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
therefore	O
no	O
scope	O
for	O
any	O
confusion	O
in	O
the	O
mind	O
of	O
the	O
witnesses	O
.	O

Their	O
statements	O
were	O
recorded	O
immediately	O
after	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
the	O
Investigating	O
Officer	O
.	O

In	O
these	O
circumstances	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
disbelieved	O
merely	O
because	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
witnesses	O
is	O
consistent	O
by	O
raising	O
a	O
suspicion	O
that	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
got	O
up	O
or	O
tutored	O
witnesses	O

Another	O
feature	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
occurrence	O
took	O
place	O
between	O
6.30	O
and	O
6.45	O
a.m	O
.	O

Soon	O
thereafter	O
the	O
Sub-Inspector	O
of	O
Police	O
,	O
PW-12	O
reached	O
the	O
village	O
on	O
hearing	O
a	O
rumor	O
after	O
making	O
an	O
entry	O
in	O
the	O
Station	O
Diary	O
.	O

Though	O
the	O
Police	O
Station	O
is	O
about	O
13	O
kilometers	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
village	O
of	O
occurrence	O
,	O
he	O
showed	O
great	O
promptness	O
in	O
reaching	O
the	O
village	O
of	O
occurrence	O
at	O
about	O
8-	O
8.15	O
a.m	O
.	O

He	O
recorded	O
the	O
statement	O
of	O
the	O
informant	O
,	O
PW-10	O
and	O
commenced	O
investigation	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
hardly	O
any	O
delay	O
in	O
lodging	O
the	O
FIR	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
opportunity	O
for	O
the	O
informant	O
to	O
concoct	O
a	O
false	O
story	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
eye	B-LEG
witnesses	O
are	O
named	O
in	O
the	O
FIR	O
and	O
their	O
presence	O
is	O
confirmed	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
their	O
statements	O
were	O
also	O
recorded	O
immediately	O
by	O
the	O
investigating	O
officer	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
by	O
noon	O
even	O
the	O
Superintendent	O
of	O
Police	O
and	O
the	O
Dy	O
.	O

Superintendent	O
of	O
Police	O
had	O
reached	O
the	O
village	O
of	O
occurrence	O
to	O
supervise	O
the	O
investigation	O
.	O

The	O
postmortem	O
examination	O
of	O
dead	O
bodies	O
was	O
also	O
held	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
by	O
4	O
different	O
medical	O
officers	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
case	O
where	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
investigating	O
agency	O
acted	O
with	O
great	O
promptitude	O
.	O

We	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
do	O
not	O
suspect	O
that	O
the	O
prosecution	O
concocted	O
a	O
false	O
case	O

The	O

carefully	O
scrutinised	O
the	O

The	O

the	O

it	O
has	O

so	O
found	O
by	O
the	O

We	O
have	O
also	O
gone	O
through	O
the	O
deposition	O
of	O
the	O

We	O
are	O
satisfied	O
that	O
the	O
injuries	O
suffered	O
by	O
the	O

in	O
their	O
death	O
as	O
found	O

as	O
deposed	O
to	O

that	O

this	O

In	O

some	O
of	O

are	O

the	O

the	O

.	O

The	O
defence	O
set	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
appellants	O
was	O
that	O
a	O
dacoity	B-LEG
was	O
committed	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Madan	O
Singh	O
on	O
the	O
night	O
intervening	O
26th	O
and	O
27th	O
March	O

1997	O

In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
dacoity	B-LEG
all	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O

by	O
the	O

The	O

also	O
examined	O
three	O

their	O

The	O
Trial	O
Court	O
as	O
well	O

the	O
High	O

have	O
carefully	O
examined	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
witnesses	O
examined	O
by	O
the	O
defence	O
but	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
the	O
defence	O
set	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
appellants	O
was	O
not	O
supported	O
by	O
any	O
reliable	O
evidence	O
on	O

We	O
have	O
carefully	O
gone	O
through	O
the	O
deposition	O
of	O
the	O
defence	O
witnesses	O
and	O
we	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
conclusion	O
reached	O
by	O
the	O
courts	O
below	O
is	O
fully	O
justified	O
.	O

DW-1	O
stated	O
that	O
a	O
dacoity	B-LEG
was	O
committed	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
deceased	O
Madan	O
Singh	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
family	O
members	O
were	O
killed	O
.	O

Many	O
people	O
had	O
assembled	O
when	O
the	O
dacoity	B-LEG
was	O
committed	O
but	O
no	O
information	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
policy	O
by	O
anyone	O
.	O

He	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
stated	O
that	O
Jagarnath	O
Rai	O
,	O
the	O
Chowkidar	O
has	O
informed	O
the	O
police	O
.	O

The	O
said	O
Chowkidar	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
examined	O

Similar	O
assertion	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
DW-2	O
who	O
belongs	O
to	O
village	O
Jamunia	O
Jasauli	O
and	O
claimed	O
to	O
be	O
present	O
in	O
village	O
Dilman	O
Chapra	O
when	O
the	O
dacoity	B-LEG
took	O
place	O

He	O
claimed	O
to	O
have	O
constructed	O
a	O
Baithka	O
in	O
village	O
Dilman	O
Chapra	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
could	O
produce	O
no	O
document	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
he	O
owned	O
any	O
land	O
in	O
Dilman	O
Chapra	O
or	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
constructed	O
a	O
Baithka	O
.	O

He	O
also	O
stated	O
that	O
no	O
case	O
of	O
dacoity	B-LEG
was	O
registered	O

So	O
far	O
as	O
DW-3	O
is	O
concerned	O
he	O
claims	O
to	O
have	O
heard	O
that	O
dacoity	B-LEG
was	O
committed	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Madan	O
Singh	O

Obviously	O
no	O
value	O
can	O
be	O
attached	O
to	O
his	O
statement	O

24	O
.	O

What	O
is	O
conspicuous	O
in	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
defence	O
witnesses	O
is	O
that	O
fact	O
that	O
though	O
a	O
dacoity	B-LEG
is	O
alleged	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
committed	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
four	O
persons	O
lost	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
no	O
one	O
informed	O
the	O

about	O
the	O

number	O
of	O
villagers	O

that	O
the	O

is	O
accused	O

any	O

We	O
have	O
therefore	O
first	O
to	O
concentrate	O
on	O
the	O
word	O
'offence	O
'	O
.	O

Now	O
an	O
offence	O
seldom	O
consists	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
act	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
usually	O
composed	O
of	O
several	O
elements	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
rule	O
,	O
a	O
whole	O
series	O
of	O
acts	O
must	O
be	O
proved	O
before	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
established	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
elements	O
alleged	O
against	O
the	O
second	O
accused	O
are	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
``	O
entrustment	O
''	O
and/or	O
``	O
dominion	O
''	O
;	O
second	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

and/or	O

was	O
``	O

that	O

a	O
``	O

;	O
and	O
fourth	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

was	O
``	O

.	O

Now	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
the	O
entrustment	O
and/or	O
dominion	O
here	O
were	O
in	O
an	O
official	O
capacity	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
evident	O
that	O
there	O
could	O
in	O
this	O

purporting	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
an	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
act	O
complained	O
of	O
,	O
namely	O
the	O
disposal	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
done	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
way	O
.	O

If	O
it	O
was	O
innocent	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
official	O
act	O
;	O
if	O
dishonest	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
dishonest	O
doing	O
of	O
an	O
official	O
act	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
either	O
event	O
the	O
act	O
was	O
official	O
because	O
the	O
second	O
accused	O
could	O
not	O
dispose	O
of	O
the	O
goods	O
save	O
by	O
the	O
doing	O
of	O
an	O
official	O
act	O
,	O
namely	O
officially	O
permitting	O
their	O
disposal	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
did	O

He	O
actually	O
permitted	O
their	O
release	O
and	O
purported	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
an	O
official	O
capacity	O
,	O
and	O
apart	O
from	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
he	O

not	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

in	O
which	O

Therefore	O
,	O
whatever	O
the	O
intention	O
or	O

behind	O
the	O

may	O
have	O
been	O
,	O
the	O

so	O
if	O

it	O
was	O
equally	O

in	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
primary	O
objects	O
of	O
the	O
1998	O

was	O
to	O

In	O
this	O

the	O

The	O
Commission	O
took	O
into	O
account	B-LEG
and	O
accepted	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
distribution	O

is	O
an	O
all	O

phenomenon	O
and	O
the	O

varies	O
from	O

the	O
location	O
being	O
a	O
rural	O
or	O
an	O

area	O

It	O
also	O
took	O
note	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
dependent	O
upon	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
distribution	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
is	O
overhead	O
or	O
underground	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
prevailing	O
culture	O
in	O
the	O
society	O

It	O
has	O
also	O
taken	O
note	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
laws	O
controlling	O
theft	O
of	O
electricity	O
till	O
recently	O
,	O
were	O
insufficient	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

also	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
steps	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
Company	O
,	O
by	O
instituting	O
prosecution	O
,	O
have	O
remained	O
futile	O
because	O
of	O
delay	O
in	O
disposal	O
of	O
these	O
cases	O

It	O
is	O
in	O
this	O
background	O
that	O
the	O
Commission	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
the	O
distribution	O
loss	O
in	O
its	O
entirety	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
controlled	O
by	O
the	O
Company	O

However	O
,	O
the	O

also	O
came	O

over	O
the	O

to	O
bring	O
down	O
this	O
loss	O
are	O
insufficient	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
hence	O
,	O
held	O
it	O
unfair	O
to	O
pass	O
on	O
the	O
whole	O
liability	O
on	O
the	O
consumers	O
.	O

therefore	O
,	O
it	O
allowed	O
a	O
distribution	O
loss	O
of	O
about	O
4.8	O
%	O
and	O
directed	O
the	O
Company	O
to	O
reduce	O
this	O
total	O
T	O
&	O
D	O
loss	O
for	O
future	O

bring	O
it	O
down	O
to	O
14	O
%	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
4	O

Thus	O

it	O
fixed	O
the	O

at	O

The	O
High	O

on	O
the	O
contrary	O

came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
the	O
distribution	O
loss	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
controlled	O
by	O
the	O
Company	O
as	O
the	O
Company	O

has	O
not	O
gained	O
anything	O
by	O

the	O

the	O

that	O

due	B-LEG

They	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
the	O

has	O
not	O
brought	O
on	O

material	O
to	O
show	O
what	O
part	O

out	O
that	O

might	O
even	O
have	O
been	O

in	O
the	O
year	O
1993	O
itself	O

the	O
Government	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

increasing	O

This	O
they	O

is	O
because	O

the	O

to	O
their	O

the	O

should	O
bear	O

against	O
the	O

at	O
22.36	O

which	O
we	O
think	O
is	O
rather	O
on	O
the	O
lower	O
side	O

therefore	O
,	O
basing	O
our	O

on	O
the	O

we	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

At	O

it	O

be	O

that	O

in	O

in	O
almost	O

,	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
such	O

once	O
or	O
twice	O

The	O
very	O
purpose	O
for	O

is	O
the	O
urgent	O
need	O
to	O

But	O
it	O
can	O
not	O

that	O
the	O

if	O

But	O
we	O
are	O

of	O
Mr.	O

that	O
those	O

on	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
reiterated	O
that	O
those	O
persons	O
also	O
had	O
undertaken	O
a	O
written	O
test	O
on	O
specified	O
subjects	O
as	O
indicated	O
in	O

after	O

in	O
the	O

But	O
that	O
by	O
itself	O
would	O

to	O

that	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

``	O

Mr.	O

,	O

that	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
considerable	O
delay	O
in	O
filing	O
the	O
FIR	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
because	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O

wanted	O

He	O
also	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O

be	O
hardly	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O

Learned	O
counsel	O
also	O
contended	O
that	O
it	O
is	O

not	O
been	O

Learned	O

further	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O

has	O
seriously	O
erred	O
in	O
invoking	O
Section	O
34	O
IPC	O
to	O

the	O

absolutely	O
no	O

He	O
supported	O
this	O

by	O

that	O

it	O

only	O
Section	O

It	O
is	O
most	O

of	O

the	O

along	O

report	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O

What	O
makes	O
the	O
entire	O

unacceptable	O
is	O
that	O

10.00	O

complaint	O
about	O

statement	O

which	O
Basavaraj	O

that	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
not	O
alive	O
when	O
the	O
police	O
reached	O
the	O
spot	O

What	O
is	O
amazing	O
is	O
the	O
admission	O
made	O
by	O
PW-19	O
that	O
the	O
report	O
received	O
by	O
him	O
about	O
the	O
incident	O
was	O
destroyed	O
by	O
him	O
after	O
the	O
fardbeyan	O
of	O
PW-1	O
was	O
recorded	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

This	O
implies	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
version	O
regarding	O
the	O
incident	O
was	O
totally	O
obliterated	O
by	O
the	O
Investigating	O

Exb	O

P-1	O
recorded	O
in	O
its	O
place	O

It	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
appreciate	O
how	O
PW-19	O
could	O
have	O
destroyed	O
the	O
original	O
complaint	O
given	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
Hanumantha	O
PW-1	O

This	O
implies	O
that	O
the	O
earliest	O
version	O
about	O
the	O
incident	O
was	O
destroyed	O
by	O
PW-19	O
and	O
a	O
new	O
story	O
stated	O
in	O
the	O
fardbeyan	O
was	O
tailored	O
to	O
suit	O
the	O
prosecution	O
version	O

This	O
has	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
completely	O
demolishing	O
the	O
prosecution	O
case	O
and	O
rendering	O
its	O
version	O
wholly	O
unacceptable	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
inference	O
which	O
can	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
circumstances	O
,	O
be	O
drawn	O
is	O
that	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
done	O
to	O
death	O
and	O
his	O
dead	O
body	O
left	O
at	O
the	O
spot	O
from	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
picked-up	O
by	O
the	O
police	O
after	O
they	O
arrived	O
around	O
10.00	O
p.m	O
.	O

The	O
complaint	O
presented	O
to	O
Sub-Inspector	O
perhaps	O
did	O
not	O
say	O
what	O
the	O
police	O
intended	O
to	O
present	O
as	O
its	O
case	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
destroyed	O
and	O
a	O
new	O
version	O
brought	O
in	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
which	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
shown	O
to	O
be	O
alive	O
when	O
the	O
police	O
reached	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

The	O
fact	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
Basavaraj	O
was	O
dead	O
when	O
his	O

to	O

The	O
testimony	O
of	O
the	O
informant	O
Basisth	O
Narayan	O
(	O
PW-5	O
)	O
is	O
vital	O
one	O
as	O
he	O
is	O
the	O
brother	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
stated	O
that	O
the	O
incident	O
occurred	O
on	O
the	O
night	O
intervening	O
29.07.1989	O
and	O
30.07.1989	O
.	O

He	O
received	O
the	O
information	O
of	O
death	O
of	O
his	O
sister	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
30.07.1989	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
her	O
place	O
.	O

He	O
found	O
large	O
assemblage	O
of	O
people	O
outside	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

On	O
going	O
inside	O
the	O
house	O
he	O
found	O
the	O
dead	O
body	O
of	O
his	O
sister	O
which	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
pink	O
colour	O
terrycot	O
saree	O
.	O

On	O
removing	O
the	O
saree	O
he	O
found	O
both	O
her	O
hands	O
were	O
tied	O
with	O
iron	O
wire	O
and	O
flesh	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
hands	O
was	O
reddish	O
while	O
neck	O
also	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
tied	O
with	O
something	O
.	O

On	O
enquiring	O
from	O
the	O
crowd	O
assembled	O
outside	O
the	O
house	O
he	O
learnt	O
that	O
the	O
previous	O
night	O
at	O
around	O
9	O
PM	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
ten	O
accused	O
persons	O
were	O
making	O
conversations	O
inside	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
even	O
sound	O
of	O
crying	O
was	O
heard	O
.	O

People	O
also	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
when	O
the	O
accused	O
persons	O
were	O
trying	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
the	O
dead	O
body	O
,	O
the	O
village	O
chowkidar	O
had	O
seen	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
all	O
fled	O
away	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
further	O
testified	O
to	O
the	O
harassment	O
met	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
deceased	O
after	O
her	O
marriage	O
at	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O
persons	O
.	O

He	O
deposed	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
dowry	O
demands	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
already	O
recorded	O
in	O
the	O
alleged	O
facts	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
prosecution	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
brevity	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
repeating	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
further	O
deposed	O
that	O
21.06.1988	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
to	O
Bishnudeo	O
Rai	O
who	O
is	O
the	O
father	O
of	O
Sarita	O
Kumari	O
to	O
whom	O
Ranjit	O
Kumar	O
was	O
rumored	O
to	O
marry	O
soon	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
requested	O
Bishnudeo	O
Rai	O
not	O
to	O
let	O
his	O
daughter	O
marry	O
Ranjit	O
Kumar	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
ruin	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
his	O
sister	O
(	O
now	O
deceased	O
)	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
dismissed	O
by	O
Bishnudeo	O
Rai	O
.	O

Later	O
he	O
learnt	O
that	O
Ranjit	O
Kumar	O
was	O
marrying	O
Sarita	O
Kumari	O
and	O
so	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
his	O
sister	O
(	O
now	O
deceased	O
)	O
to	O
her	O
matrimonial	O
house	O
and	O
due	O
to	O
this	O
reason	O
the	O
marriage	O
was	O
postponed	O
from	O
24.06.1988	O
to	O
27.06.1988	O
.	O

Thereafter	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
alleged	O
that	O
Ranjit	O
Kumar	O
did	O
marry	O
Sarita	O
Kumari	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
no	O
conclusive	B-LEG
proof	I-LEG
is	O
brought	O

to	O
prove	O
this	O
fact	O

Apart	O
from	O
oral	O
testimony	O
,	O
we	O
find	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
letter	O
dated	O
09.08.1988	O
written	O
in	O
handwriting	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
and	O
signature	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
,	O
to	O
her	O
brother	O
Basisth	O
Narayan	O
wherein	O
she	O
has	O
expressed	O
her	O
fears	O
of	O
being	O
killed	O
by	O
her	O
in-laws	O
if	O
the	O
demands	O
of	O
dowry	O
were	O
not	O
met	O

She	O
mentions	O
in	O
that	O
letter	O
about	O
a	O
past	O

when	O
she	O
was	O
given	O
poison	O
in	O
her	O
food	O
but	O
she	O
threw	O
away	O
the	O
food	O
.	O

This	O
letter	O
was	O
proved	O
by	O
PW-5	O
as	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
he	O
received	O
from	O
his	O
sister	O
.	O

The	O
medical	B-LEG
evidence	I-LEG
in	O
this	O

is	O
the	O
post	B-LEG

The	O
post	B-LEG

reveals	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
numerous	O

injuries	O

Three	O

in	O

the	O

The	O

to	O

The	O

not	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
a	O

case	O
of	O
its	O

except	O
claiming	O
that	O

We	O
have	O

We	O
find	O
that	O

from	O
many	O
infirmities	O

we	O
may	O
not	O

of	O
the	O

that	O
this	O

Even	O
with	O

of	O
30.07.1989	O
due	O
to	O

It	O

that	O

at	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

of	O

that	O

that	O

that	O

We	O
also	O
find	O
no	O
force	O
whatsoever	O
in	O

of	O

for	O

The	O
next	O
contention	O
that	O
was	O
raised	O
by	O
the	O
Counsel	O
for	O
the	O
Appellant	O
was	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
cheques	O
presented	O
had	O
been	O
dishonoured	O
on	O
presentation	O
,	O
the	O
said	O
transaction	O
did	O
not	O
culminate	O
in	O
an	O
acquisition	B-LEG
.	O

It	O
has	O
already	O
been	O
held	O
beyond	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
post-dated	O
cheques	O
issued	O
by	O
the	O
Appellant	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
HSIDC	O
were	O
in	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
buy	B-LEG
back	O
of	O
the	O
shares	O
held	O
by	O
HSIDC	O
in	O
the	O
Target	O
Company	O
.	O

The	O
Appellant	O
had	O
submitted	O
that	O
the	O
cheques	O
were	O
post-dated	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
suffering	O
from	O
a	O
liquidity	O
crunch	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
view	O
,	O
the	O
post-dated	O
cheques	O
amounted	O
to	O
a	O
promise	O
to	O
pay	O
and	O
that	O
promise	O
would	O
be	O
fulfilled	O
on	O
the	O
date	O
mentioned	O
on	O
the	O
cheque	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
this	O
promise	O
to	O
pay	O
amounted	O
to	O
a	O
sale	O
of	O
