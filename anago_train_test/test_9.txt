We	O
have	O
already	O
discussed	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
distinction	O
between	O
the	O
political	O
and	O
the	O
administrative	O

and	O
to	O
appreciate	O
that	O
parity	O
in	O

can	O
only	O
be	O
between	O
Judges	O
and	O
the	O
political	O
executive	O
and	O
not	O
between	O
Judges	O
and	O
the	O
administrative	O
executive	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
the	O
earlier	O
approach	O
of	O
comparison	O
between	O
the	O
service	O
conditions	O
of	O
the	O
Judges	O
and	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
administrative	O

has	O
to	O

and	O
the	O

the	O

which	O
are	O
wrongly	O

those	O
of	O

We	O
have	O
also	O
emphasised	O
earlier	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
entrusting	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
prescribing	O
the	O

conditions	O
for	O
the	O

to	O
a	O
separate	O
pay	O
commission	O
exclusively	O
set	O

for	O
the	O

Hence	O
,	O
we	O
reiterate	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
such	O
separate	O
commission	O
and	O
also	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
prescribing	O

to	O
the	O
Judges	O

The	O

it	O

The	O
next	O
question	O
which	O
arose	O

we	O

that	O

The	O
Shetty	O
Commission	O
had	O
recommended	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
an	O
increase	O
in	O
retirement	O
age	O
from	O
60	O
to	O
62	O
years	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
opinion	O
,	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
for	O
the	O
simple	O
reason	O
that	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
retirement	O
of	O
a	O
High	O
Court	O
Judge	O
is	O
constitutionally	O
fixed	O
at	O
62	O
years	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
appropriate	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
constitutional	O
framework	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
judiciary	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
identical	O
age	O
of	O
retirement	O
between	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
subordinate	B-LEG
judicial	I-LEG
service	I-LEG

a	O
High	O
Court	O

As	O
of	O
today	O
,	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
retirement	O
of	O
a	O
Supreme	O
Court	O
Judge	O
is	O
65	O
years	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
High	O
Court	O
Judge	O
it	O
is	O
62	O
years	O
and	O
logically	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
retirement	O
of	O
a	O
judicial	O
officer	O
is	O
60	O
years	O
.	O

This	O
difference	O
is	O
appropriate	O
and	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
maintained	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
backlog	O
of	O
vacancies	O
which	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
filled	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
Judge	O
strength	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
increased	O
,	O
as	O
directed	O
by	O
us	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
appropriate	O
for	O
the	O
States	O
in	O
consultation	O
with	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
to	O
amend	O
the	O
service	O
rules	O

to	O
provide	O
for	O
re-employment	O
of	O
the	O
retiring	O
judicial	O
officer	O
till	O
the	O
age	O
of	O

if	O
there	O
are	O
vacancies	O
in	O
the	O
cadre	O
of	O
the	O

this	O
to	O
be	O

Another	O
question	O
which	O
falls	O
for	O
consideration	O
is	O
the	O
method	O
of	O
recruitment	O
to	O
the	O
posts	O
in	O
the	O
cadre	O
of	O
higher	O
judicial	B-LEG

Additional	O
District	O
Judges	O

At	O
the	O
present	O
moment	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
tow	O
sources	O
for	O
recruitment	O
to	O
the	O
higher	O
judicial	B-LEG
service	I-LEG
,	O
namely	O
,	O
by	O
promotion	O
from	O
amongst	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
sub-ordinate	O
judicial	B-LEG
service	I-LEG
and	O
by	O
direct	O
recruitment	O
.	O

The	O
subordinate	O
judiciary	O
is	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
the	O
edifice	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
system	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
imperative	O
,	O
like	O
any	O
other	O
foundation	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
become	O
as	O
strong	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

The	O
weight	O
on	O
the	O
judicial	O
system	O
essentially	O
rests	O
on	O
the	O
subordinate	O
judiciary	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
have	O
accepted	O
the	O
recommendation	O
of	O
the	O
Shetty	O
Commission	O
which	O
will	O
result	O
in	O
the	O
increase	O
in	O
the	O
pay	O
scales	O
of	O
the	O
subordinate	O
judiciary	O
it	O
is	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
necessary	O
that	O
the	O
judicial	O
officers	O
,	O
hardworking	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
,	O
become	O
more	O
efficient	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
imperative	O
that	O
they	O
keep	O
abreast	O
of	O
knowledge	O
of	O
law	O
and	O
the	O
latest	O
pronouncements	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
that	O
the	O
Shetty	O
Commission	O
has	O
recommended	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
a	O
judicial	O
academy	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
necessary	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
there	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
minimum	O
standards	O
,	O
objectively	O
adjudged	O
,	O
for	O
officers	O
who	O
are	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
higher	O
judicial	B-LEG
service	I-LEG
as	O
Additional	O
District	O
Judges	O
and	O
District	O
Judges	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
Shetty	O
Commission	O
that	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
higher	O

,	O
the	O
District	O
Judge	O

from	O
amongst	O
the	O
advocates	O
should	O
be	O
25	O
per	O

and	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
recruitment	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
by	O
a	O
competitive	O
examination	O
,	O
both	O
written	O
and	O
viva	O
voce	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
an	O
objective	O
method	O
of	O
testing	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

for	O

the	O

Furthermore	O

there	O
should	O
also	O
be	O
an	O
incentive	O

to	O

In	O
this	O

we	O

that	O
the	O
calibre	O
of	O

among	O

first	O
and	O
the	O

is	O
that	O
although	O

does	O
it	O
suggest	O
that	O

When	O
confronted	O
with	O
this	O
vital	O
omission	O
from	O
the	O
FIR	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
explanation	O
which	O
the	O
first	O

has	O
offered	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
white	O
paper	O
was	O
got	O
signed	O
by	O
somebody	O
from	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O

village	O

We	O
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
accept	O
that	O
explanation	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
because	O
the	O
omission	O
of	O
the	O
names	O
in	O
the	O
FIR	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
lightly	O
brushed	O
aside	O
by	O
any	O
such	O
explanation	O
but	O
also	O
because	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
investigating	O
officer	O
,	O
upon	O
arrival	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
recorded	O
the	O
statement	O
of	O
the	O

about	O
the	O
incident	O

If	O
that	O
were	O
so	O

Subject	O
to	O
what	O
has	O

we	O
may	O
add	O
that	O

It	O
was	O
also	O
submitted	O
that	O
the	O
impugned	O

would	O
hit	O
the	O

inasmuch	O

in	O

have	O
no	O

they	O
almost	O

them	O
to	O
do	O
so	O

.	O

A	O
male	O
who	O
compels	O
his	O
wife	O
to	O
bear	O
a	O

would	O
disqualify	O
not	O
only	O
his	O

himself	O

which	O

they	O

even	O

they	O
do	O
not	O

that	O

exception	O
in	O

of	O

it	O

that	O
the	O
delay	O
of	O
26	O
