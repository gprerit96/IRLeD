misappropriation	O
of	O

and	O

on	O
the	O
part	O

It	O

that	O

a	O

,	O
an	O

is	O

Second	O
,	O
unless	O
the	O

is	O
to	O
the	O

Clause	I-LEG
itself	O
,	O
the	O
issue	O

's	O
validity	O
is	O
considered	O
by	O
the	O
arbitrator	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
.	O

Third	O
,	O
this	O
arbitration	B-LEG
law	I-LEG
applies	O
in	O
state	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
federal	O

.	O

The	O
parties	O
have	O
not	O
requested	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
undertake	O
,	O
reconsideration	O
of	O
those	O
holdings	O
.	O

Applying	O
them	O
to	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
we	O
conclude	O
that	O
because	O
Respondents	O
challenge	O
the	O
Agreement	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
specifically	O
its	O

,	O
those	O

are	O

apart	O

The	O

this	O

have	O
a	O
choice	O
either	O
to	O
approach	O
DRT	O

the	O
Company	B-LEG
Court	I-LEG

The	O
language	O
of	O
the	O
RDB	O
Act	O
,	O
being	O
clear	O

provides	O
that	O
any	O

The	O
Official	B-LEG
Liquidator	I-LEG
whose	O
association	B-LEG
is	O
mandatorily	O
required	O
can	O
indubitably	O
be	O
regarded	O

a	O
person	O
aggrieved	O

Under	O
these	O

the	O

can	O
not	O
even	O
take	O
recourse	O
to	O
the	O
doctrine	O

It	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
conceive	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
remedies	O

It	O
is	O
well	O
settled	O
in	O

that	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
only	O
one	O
remedy	O
,	O
the	O
doctrine	O
of	O
election	O
does	O
not	O
apply	O
and	O
we	O
are	O
disposed	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
Official	B-LEG
Liquidator	I-LEG
has	O
only	O
one	O
remedy	O
i.e	O

to	O
challenge	O

Thus	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
inclined	O
to	O
conclude	O
and	O
hold	O
that	O
the	O
Official	B-LEG

only	O
take	O

to	O
the	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
stated	O

that	O
the	O

On	O
the	O
aforesaid	O
basis	O
,	O
this	O
Court	O
opined	O
that	O
when	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

was	O

the	O

all	O

therefore	O

we	O

In	O
our	O
opinion	O
the	O

on	O

,	O
1964	O
that	O

Since	O
there	O

there	O

the	O

the	O
acceptance	B-LEG

by	O
the	O

Judge	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
sound	O
exercise	O
of	O
discretion	O

It	O
is	O
contended	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
Appellant	O
that	O
confirmation	O
was	O
discretionary	O
with	O
the	O
Court	O

the	O

ought	O
not	O
to	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
the	O

ought	O
not	O
to	O

the	O

Company	B-LEG
Judge	O
having	O
decided	O
to	O
put	O
the	O

in	O
not	O
holding	O
the	O
auction	O
as	O
a	O
public	O
auction	O
after	O
due	O
publicity	O
and	O
this	O
has	O
resulted	O
in	O
prejudice	O
to	O
the	O
Company	B-LEG
and	O
the	O
creditors	B-LEG
in	O
that	O
the	O
auction	O
did	O
not	O
fetch	O
adequate	O
price	O

The	O
prejudice	O
was	O
inherent	O
in	O
the	O
method	O
adopted	O

The	O

Chand	O

also	O
suggests	O
that	O

had	O
resulted	O
in	O

In	O
these	O

the	O

Dr.	O

learned	O
senior	O

appearing	O
for	O

contended	O
that	O

its	O
power	O
of	O

jurisdiction	O
of	O
a	O

the	O

the	O
conclusion	O
arrived	O
at	O

the	O
inferior	O

will	O
be	O

a	O

being	O
the	O
parameters	O
for	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

was	O
not	O
called	O
upon	O

Dr.	O

that	O
of	O

Dr.	O

in	O

our	O

:	O

That	O
HRC	O
gives	O
only	O
2	O
acres	O
of	O
land	O
to	O
each	O
displaced	O
family	O
is	O
not	O
satisfactory	O
.	O

In	O
case	O
of	O
Sardar	O
Sarovar	O
Project	O
in	O
Gujarat	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
contended	O
that	O
each	O
family	O
is	O
getting	O
2	O
hectares	O
of	O
land	O
as	O
a	O
minimum	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
logic	O
for	O
discriminating	O
against	O
the	O
project	O
affected	O
persons	O
of	O
the	O
Tehri	O
Project	O
and	O
such	O
discrimination	O
violates	O
their	O
fundamental	O
rights	O
under	O
the	O
Constitution	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
equal	O
under	O
the	O
law	O
.	O

We	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
appropriate	O
to	O
hold	O
that	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
land	O
recommended	O
by	O
HRC	O
is	O
inadequate	O
or	O
insufficient	O
.	O

Such	O
recommendation	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
by	O
HRC	O
after	O
due	O
deliberation	O
in	O
the	O
matter	O
on	O
the	O
availability	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
in	O
the	O
region	O
,	O
the	O
life	O
style	O
of	O
the	O
persons	O
affected	O
,	O
their	O
needs	O
and	O
other	O
relevant	O
factors	O
in	O
this	O
regard	O

Above	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
project	O
is	O
being	O
carried	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
hilly	O
area	O
where	O
land	O
is	O
very	O
scarce	O
.	O

In	O
such	O
circumstances	O
,	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
any	O
comparison	O
can	O
be	O
drawn	O
between	O
Sardar	O
Sarovar	O
Project	O
and	O
Tehri	O
Project	O

we	O
reject	O
this	O
contention	O
raised	O
on	O

of	O
the	O

2	O
.	O

Next	O
recommendation	O
in	O
respect	O
of	O
which	O
objection	O
is	O
raised	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
Government	O
of	O
India	O
has	O
chosen	O
to	O
treat	O
as	O
separate	O
families	O
sons	O
and	O
unmarried	O
daughters	O
who	O
have	O
attained	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
21	O
years	O
on	O
the	O
prescribed	O
date	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
urged	O
that	O
18	O
years	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
as	O
the	O
age	O
for	O
such	O
classification	O
and	O
not	O
21	O
years	O
.	O

These	O
matters	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
realm	O
of	O
decision	O
of	O
the	O
recommendatory	O
body	O
and	O
the	O
Government	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Government	O
had	O
chosen	O
any	O
other	O
age	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
held	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
Irrational	O
.	O

The	O
contention	O
that	O
voting	O
rights	O
to	O
citizens	O
had	O
been	O
given	O
even	O
at	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
18	O
years	O
has	O
no	O
relevance	O
to	O
the	O
facts	O
under	O
consideration	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
this	O
contention	O
also	O
does	O
not	O
deserve	O
our	O
intervention	O
.	O

3	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
objection	O
is	O
raised	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
major	O
sons	O
and	O
unmarried	O
daughters	O
not	O
being	O
given	O
land	O
but	O
only	O
cash	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
acceptable	O
as	O
the	O
same	O
results	O
in	O
discrimination	O
particularly	O
once	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
recognised	O
as	O
separate	O
families	O
and	O
such	O
discrimination	O
would	O
be	O
violative	O
of	O
their	O
fundamental	O
rights	O
under	O
the	O
Constitution	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
contended	O
that	O
all	O
major	O
married	O
sons	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
2	O
hectares	O
of	O
land	O
as	O
a	O
minimum	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
benefits	O
due	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
displaced	O
family	O
under	O
the	O
package	O
and	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
given	O
the	O
option	O
of	O
taking	O
cash	O
,	O
equivalent	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
2	O
hectares	O
of	O
land	O
in	O
lieu	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
so	O
desire	O
.	O

This	O
argument	O
also	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
accepted	O
because	O
as	O
stated	O
earlier	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
scarcity	O
of	O
land	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
feasible	O
to	O
provide	O
land	O
to	O
every	O
family	O
and	O
even	O
such	O
families	O
as	O
have	O
been	O
treated	O
for	O
purposes	O
of	O
giving	O
larger	O
benefit	O
major	O
sons	O
and	O
unmarried	O
daughters	O
are	O
treated	O
as	O
a	O
separate	O
family	O
and	O
not	O
for	O
any	O
other	O
purposes	O
.	O

Similarly	O
other	O
contention	O
that	O
the	O
unmarried	O
sons	O
and	O
daughters	O
should	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
a	O
half	O
a	O
family	O
unit	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
half	O
hectare	O
of	O
land	O
or	O
cash	O
in	O
lieu	O
thereof	O
,	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
accepted	O
.	O

The	O
contention	O
now	O
put	O
forth	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
lands	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
acquired	O

no	O
further	O
progress	O
of	O
the	O

should	O
be	O

it	O
is	O
further	O

that	O
if	O
the	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
may	O
be	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
not	O

courage	O
to	O
depose	O
against	O
an	O

may	O
not	O
stand	O
the	O
test	O

may	O
be	O
sometime	O
because	O
he	O

understand	O
the	O

These	O
days	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
difficult	O
to	O
gain	O
over	O
a	O

any	O

instances	O
are	O
also	O
not	O
uncommon	O
where	O
a	O

is	O
not	O

structure	O

of	O

Their	O
evidence	O
sometimes	O
becomes	O
doubtful	O
because	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
act	O

take	O
everything	O

,	O
in	O

is	O
faced	O
with	O
so	O
many	O
odds	O

The	O

while	O

to	O
be	O
there	O
in	O

that	O

It	O
was	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
basis	O
on	O
which	O
Section	O
30	O
operates	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
person	O
makes	O
a	O
confession	O
implicating	O
himself	O
that	O
may	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
maker	O
of	O
the	O
confession	O
is	O
speaking	O
the	O
truth	O

Normally	O

if	O
a	O
statement	O
made	O
by	O
an	O
accused	O
person	O
is	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
voluntary	O
and	O
it	O
amounts	O
to	O
a	O
confession	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
it	O
implicates	O
the	O
maker	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
likely	O
that	O
the	O
maker	O
would	O
implicate	O
himself	O
untruly	O

So	O
Section	O
30	O
provides	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
confession	O
may	O
be	O
taken	O
into	O
consideration	O
even	O
against	O
the	O
co	B-LEG

who	O
is	O
being	O
tried	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
maker	O
of	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
significant	O
however	O
that	O
like	O
other	O
evidence	O
which	O
is	O
produced	O
before	O
the	O
Court	O
is	O
not	O
obligatory	O
on	O
the	O
Court	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
confession	O
into	O

When	O
evidence	O
as	O
defined	O
by	O

the	O

it	O

What	O
weight	O
should	O

discretion	O

But	O
the	O
Court	O
can	O
not	O
say	O
in	O

of	O
such	O
evidence	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
just	O
not	O
take	O
that	O

Such	O
an	O
approach	O
can	O
however	O
be	O
adopted	O
by	O
the	O
Court	O
in	O
dealing	O
with	O
a	O
confession	O
because	O
Section	O
30	O
merely	O
enables	O
the	O
Court	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
confession	O
into	O
account	O

Where	O

however	O

the	O
Court	O
takes	O
it	O
into	O
confidence	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
faulted	O

The	O
principle	O
is	O
that	O
the	O

can	O
not	O
start	O
with	O
confession	O
of	O
a	O

person	O
;	O
it	O
must	O

with	O

after	O
it	O
has	O

its	O
opinion	O
with	O

to	O
the	O
quality	O
and	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
said	O
evidence	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
permissible	O
to	O
turn	O
to	O
the	O
confession	O
in	O

to	O
receive	O

Membership	O

an	O

an	O

gets	O
resolved	O
during	O
the	O

reducing	O
the	O

process	O
into	O
a	O

Such	O
delay	O
coupled	O
with	O
a	O

makes	O
the	O

a	O

The	O

too	O

The	O
law	O
of	O

there	O
is	O

claim	O
that	O
