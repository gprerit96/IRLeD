Section	O

which	O
inter	O

provide	O
that	O
after	O
declaring	O

the	O
High	O

Therefore	O

for	O
declaring	O
the	O
election-petitioner	O

reasons	O

Second	O
ingredient	O
provides	O
for	O

if	O
it	O

that	O
elected	O
candidate	O
obtained	O
more	O
than	O

we	O
are	O
of	O
the	O

that	O

rightly	O
applied	O

was	O
obtained	O
only	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O

the	O

was	O
delayed	O

a	O

that	O
the	O

(	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

also	O
apparent	O
that	O
where	O

maxim	O
:	O
'Once	O

(	O

Secondly	O
,	O
the	O

can	O
not	O
reserve	O
to	O
himself	O
any	O
collateral	O
advantage	O
outside	O
the	O
mortgage	B-LEG
agreement	B-LEG
.	O

Thirdly	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
corollary	O
from	O
the	O
first	O
another	O
principle	O
may	O
be	O
deduced	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
'once	O

any	O
stipulation	O

The	O
maxim	O
'once	O

may	O
be	O

the	O
doctrine	O

which	O

the	O
very	O
foundation	O

for	O
the	O
protection	O
which	O
the	O
law	O
throws	O
round	O
the	O

be	O
rendered	O
wholly	O

right	O

limited	O
by	O

parties	O

Right	O
to	O
redeem	O
is	O
an	O
incident	O

a	O
subsisting	O

is	O
inseparable	O
from	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
right	O
is	O
co-extensive	O
with	O
the	O

itself	O

The	O
right	O

on	O

itself	O

the	O

acquisition	B-LEG
of	O

all	O

prior	O

29.4.1984	O
were	O
unobjectionable	O

.	O

This	O
contention	O

no	O
force	O

can	O
be	O
made	O
not	O
only	O
prospectively	O

The	O

that	O
only	O
a	O

to	O
the	O

can	O
be	O
acquired	O

it	O

its	O

This	O

does	O
not	O
assume	O
any	O

the	O

we	O
have	O
taken	O

that	O
the	O

inter-connected	O
