is	O
that	O

For	O

Parliament	B-LEG

We	O
find	O
on	O
plain	O
reading	O
of	O
Section	O

,	O
it	O
empowers	O
the	O
State	O

of	O

There	O
is	O

nothing	O
in	O
the	O

reading	O
by	O
itself	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
whether	O
such	O

can	O
be	O
exercised	O
by	O
the	O
State	O
while	O

its	O

or	O
can	O
be	O
exercised	O
only	O
where	O
such	O
State	O
does	O
not	O
run	O
its	O

This	O
leads	O
to	O
two	O
possible	O
interpretations	O

In	O

the	O
interpretation	B-LEG
given	O
by	O
the	O
union	O
to	O
read	O
down	O
the	O
provision	O
has	O
substance	O
.	O

This	O
would	O
mean	O
that	O
the	O
State	O
could	O
only	O
exercise	O
such	O
discretion	O
if	O
it	O
decides	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
lottery	O
within	O
its	O
territory	O
including	O
its	O
own	O
lottery	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
situation	O
,	O
the	O
delegate	B-LEG
is	O
tied	O
down	O
by	O
this	O
limitation	O
which	O
itself	O
is	O
a	O
clear	O
guide	O
to	O
a	O
State	O
hence	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
unbridled	O
delegation	B-LEG

So	O
even	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
arbitrary	O
or	O
unbridled	O

So	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
hesitation	O
to	O
approve	O
the	O

The	O

The	O

the	O

This	O
leads	O

the	O

This	O
would	O

that	O
the	O

The	O

If	O

Section	O
2	O
(	O

of	O

Thus	O
where	O
the	O

wanted	O

of	O
Section	O

it	O

29	O

We	O
see	O
no	O
substance	O

the	O

that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
unnecessary	O
interference	O
by	O

in	O

Section	O
5	O
provides	O
that	O
no	O

Section	O

Thus	O
there	O
can	O
not	O

under	O
Section	O

for	O

the	O

All	O
such	O

under	O
the	O

Mr.	O
Sen	O
had	O
also	O
submitted	O
that	O
the	O
term	O
``	O
arbitral	B-LEG
award	I-LEG
''	O
includes	O
an	O
interim	B-LEG
award	I-LEG

He	O
had	O
submitted	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
open	O
for	O
the	O
arbitral	B-LEG
tribunal	I-LEG
to	O
pass	O
interim	O
awards	O

those	O
interim	O

could	O
be	O
enforced	O
in	O
India	O
under	O
Part	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
difference	O
between	O
an	O
``	O

''	O
and	O
an	O
``	O
interim	O

Undoubtedly	O
,	O
the	O
arbitral	B-LEG

could	O
pass	O
an	O

But	O
an	O
interim	O
order	O
or	O
directions	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
arbitral	B-LEG
tribunal	I-LEG
would	O
not	O
be	O

in	O
India	O

Thus	O
even	O
in	O
respect	O
of	O
arbitrations	O
covered	O
by	O
Part	O
II	O
a	O
party	O
would	O
be	O

In	O
any	O

We	O

that	O
there	O

against	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
case	O
projected	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
remind	O
ourselves	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
proceedings	O
,	O
this	O
Court	O
is	O
concerned	O
not	O
about	O
the	O
feasibility	O
of	O
framing	O
of	O
the	O
charge	O
Under	O
Section	O
376	O
Indian	O

grant	O
of	O

the	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
arguments	O
of	O
the	O
prosecutrix	B-LEG
that	O
such	O
a	O
charge	O
is	O
rightly	O
framed	O
and	O
the	O
submissions	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
Appellant	O
attempting	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
loopholes	O
and	O
the	O
weakness	O
in	O
the	O
prosecution	O
case	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
of	O
much	O
relevance	O
to	O
the	O
issue	O
involved	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
stage	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
said	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
physical	O
relationship	O
between	O
the	O
Appellant	O
and	O
the	O
prosecutrix	B-LEG
and	O
,	O
if	O
so	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
consensual	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
no	O
charge	O
of	O
rape	O
was	O
made	O
out	O
.	O

The	O
fact	O
remains	O
that	O
a	O
charge	O
of	O
rape	O
has	O
been	O
framed	O

It	O
would	O
ultimately	O
be	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O

to	O
arrive	O
at	O
the	O
findings	O
as	O
to	O
whether	O
such	O
a	O
charge	O
stands	O
proved	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
evidence	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
produced	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
in	O
support	O
of	O
this	O
charge	O

With	O
these	O
preliminary	O
remarks	O

we	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
core	O
issue	O

namely	O

whether	O
in	O

circumstances	O
of	O
this	O
case	O

Appellant	O
was	O
entitled	O
to	O

not	O

the	O

allegations	O

that	O
an	O

a	O

to	O

the	O

the	O

in	O
the	O
solution	O
of	O
the	O
question	O
whether	O

should	O

is	O
whether	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
the	O

will	O
appear	O
to	O
take	O
his	O
trial	O
.	O

Otherwise	O
,	O
bail	O
is	O
not	O
to	O

withheld	O
as	O
a	O
punishment	O

The	O

also	O
to	O
consider	O
whether	O
there	O

any	O
possibility	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O

or	O

Once	O
these	O
tests	O

should	O
be	O

to	O
an	O
undertrial	O
which	O

important	O
as	O

from	O

namely	O
,	O
an	O
accused	O

grant	O
