The	O

of	O
the	O
view	O
that	O
the	O
officer	O
was	O
not	O
fit	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
extension	O

that	O
his	O

be	O

from	O
the	O
uncontrovertibly	O
facts	O
emerging	O
from	O
the	O
disciplinary	B-LEG

pending	O
against	O
him	O

that	O

The	O
charges	O
that	O
Shri	O
Mata	O
Deen	O
Garg	O
himself	O
was	O
the	O
counsel	O
for	O
the	O

all	O

that	O
he	O
decided	O
a	O
case	O
in	O

his	O

was	O
interested	O

Another	O
charge	O
in	O

is	O
about	O
harassment	O
of	O
a	O
lady	O
judicial	O
officer	O

Shri	O
Mata	O

Though	O
the	O

The	O
Committee	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
view	O
that	O
the	O

are	O
sufficient	O

,	O
the	O
delay	O

one	O

at	O
the	O

Secondly	O
,	O
the	O
accused	O
had	O
put	O
a	O
very	O
consistent	O
story	O
at	O
all	O
stages	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
starting	O
from	O
the	O
missing	O

to	O
the	O
Section	O

statement	O
without	O
any	O

He	O
states	O
that	O
on	O
26th	O
August	O
2008	O
while	O
returning	O
from	O
Wadsa	O
,	O
he	O
exhausted	O
fuel	O
in	O
the	O

so	O
dropped	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
two	O
daughters	O
at	O

Gas	O
Agency	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
get	O
fuel	O
from	O
the	O
petrol	O

.	O

When	O
he	O
returned	O
in	O
15-20	O
minutes	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
Shubhangi	O
and	O
two	O
daughters	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
sounds	O
a	O
plausible	O
story	O
and	O
prosecution	O
has	O
done	O
nothing	O
to	O
really	O
counter	O
this	O
version	O
.	O

The	O
Sessions	O
Judge	O
found	O
that	O
this	O
story	O
was	O
unreliable	O
as	O
the	O
accused	O
had	O
failed	O
to	O
put	O
on	O
record	O
the	O
bill	O
for	O
the	O
fuel	O
which	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
fill	O
in	O
the	O
bike	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
find	O
this	O
reasoning	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
reality	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
not	O
to	O
many	O
people	O
would	O
ask	O
for	O
receipts	O
when	O
refueling	O
their	O
vehicles	O
in	O
India	O
and	O
the	O
accused	O
may	O
not	O
have	O
expected	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

With	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
shifting	O
of	O
burden	B-LEG
of	I-LEG
proof	I-LEG
on	O
the	O
accused	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O
happening	O
of	O
26	O
August	O
2008	O
,	O
the	O
prosecution	O
has	O
relied	O
on	O
the	O
motive	O
that	O
Accused-Appellant	O
was	O
hoping	O
to	O
get	O
Rs	O
.	O

2	O
lakhs	O
from	O
Shalinibai	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
already	O
noted	O
above	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
logically	O
flawed	O
since	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Shubhangi	O
would	O
not	O
make	O
Accused-Appellant	O
a	O
rightful	O
claimant	O
of	O
that	O
amount	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
this	O
motive	O
does	O
not	O
explain	O
the	O
murder	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
daughters	O
.	O

Lack	O
of	O
justified	O
motive	O
would	O
adversely	O
affect	O
the	O
case	O

the	O

Further	O
,	O
we	O
find	O
no	O
merit	O
in	O
the	O
Trial	O
Court	O
's	O
reasoning	O
in	O
finding	O
the	O
facts	O
that	O

asked	O
his	O

to	O
prepare	O

,	O

on	O
the	O
next	O

and	O
leaving	O
the	O

at	O
HP	O
Gas	O
Agency	O
as	O
incriminating	O
pieces	O
of	O

The	O

could	O
have	O
asked	O
his	O
friend	O
and	O
colleague	O
to	O
prepare	O

in	O

course	O
as	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
got	O
late	O
in	O
returning	O
from	O
Wadsa	O
.	O

Further	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
natural	O
for	O
the	O
accused	O
to	O
search	O
and	O
try	O

find	O
out	O
his	O
family	O
even	O
before	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
the	O

We	O
do	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
was	O
unnatural	O
to	O
have	O
registered	O
a	O
missing	O
report	O
the	O
very	O
next	O

Also	O
,	O
leaving	O
wife	O

at	O

is	O
not	O

With	O

The	O
most	O

feature	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
casting	O
great	O
doubt	O
on	O
the	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O

in	O
his	O

It	O
is	O
most	O
unlikely	O
that	O

''	O
The	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
fundamental	O

is	O
two-fold	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
that	O
every	O

must	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
claim	O
those	O

it	O

quite	O

that	O
if	O

thus	O

it	O
forms	O
the	O

which	O
the	O

Therefore	O

instead	O

a	O

in	O
the	O
case	B-LEG

Anand	O

(	O

The	O
question	O
before	O
the	O

was	O
whether	O
a	O
building	B-LEG
that	O
was	O
used	O
as	O
a	O

We	O

said	O

differentiate	O
a	O
building	B-LEG
for	O
grant	O
of	O

the	O

It	O
was	O
held	O
by	O
the	O
Minister	O
as	O
under	O
:	O
...	O
I	O
am	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
matter	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
dealt	O
with	O
in	O
a	O
just	O
manner	O
by	O
the	O
appellate	O
authority	O
.	O

The	O
subsequent	O
action	O
of	O
the	O
Petitioners	O
in	O
filing	O
appeals	O
before	O
the	O
JRCS	O
have	O
all	O
been	O
exercised	O
in	O
futility	O
because	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
not	O
given	O
thought	O
on	O
merits	O
all	O
along	O
by	O
the	O
authorities	O
.	O

If	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
claim	O
of	O
the	O
Petitioners	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
managed	O
to	O
repay	O
a	O
substantial	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
loan	O
i.e	O
.	O

the	O
principal	O
amount	O
before	O
the	O
specified	O
date	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
circular	O
dated	O
02.03.1984	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
they	O
have	O
complied	O
with	O
the	O
condition	O
as	O
laid	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
circular	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
duty	O
of	O
the	O
appellate	O
authorities	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
said	O
contentions	O
and	O
then	O
decide	O
the	O
matter	O
keeping	O
in	O
mind	O
the	O
conditions	O
of	O
the	O
said	O
circular	O
.	O

The	O
issue	O
to	O
be	O
decided	O
here	O
is	O
whether	O
the	O
Petitioners	O
claim	O
to	O
the	O
interest	O
waiver	O
and	O
consequent	O
benefits	O
are	O
reasonable	O
and	O
tenable	O
.	O

...	O
.It	O
is	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
loan	O
overdue	O
is	O
not	O
really	O
huge	O
.	O

Yet	O
the	O
Sale	O

thought	O
it	O
fit	O
to	O
auction	B-LEG

367/-	O
with	O
interest	O

The	O
sale	O
was	O
accepted	O
for	O
an	O
offer	O
of	O
Rs	O
.	O

40,650/-	O
...	O
...	O
...	O
...	O
From	O
the	O
above	O
arguments	O
it	O
is	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
sale	O
Officer	O
,	O
ARCS	O
AND	O
DRCS	O
,	O
all	O
along	O
have	O
latched	O
on	O
to	O
technical	O
considerations	O
and	O
have	O
not	O
analysed	O
the	O
matter	O
objectively	O
.	O

It	O
appears	O
that	O
their	O
approach	O
has	O
been	O
rather	O
narrow	O
and	O
such	O
long	O
drawn	O
litigation	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
avoided	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
authorities	O
thought	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
rational	O
manner	O
instead	O
of	O
going	O
into	O
avoidable	O
technicalities	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
DRCS	O
should	O
have	O
examined	O
the	O
facts	O
and	O
circumstances	O
of	O
the	O
auction	B-LEG
sale	O
in	O
the	O
appeals	O
before	O
him	O
and	O
decide	O
the	O
matter	O
.	O

Available	O
facts	O
indicate	O
that	O
such	O
an	O
effort	O
was	O
not	O
made	O
and	O
the	O
matter	O
went	O
into	O
litigation	O
for	O
years	O
.	O

While	O
I	O
am	O
aware	O
the	O
auction	B-LEG
sale	O
was	O
held	O
in	O
1981	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
unfortunate	O
that	O
not	O
enough	O
efforts	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
authorities	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
case	O
at	O
hand	O
in	O
an	O
objective	O
manner	O
and	O
the	O
facts	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
analysed	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
interest	O

ordered	O
by	O
the	O
State	O

that	O

conditions	O

that	O
prevailed	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
A-5	O
that	O
except	O
for	O
first	O
transaction	O
he	O
borrowed	O
money	O
from	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
his	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
absurd	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
A-5	O

certain	O

He	O
contends	O
that	O

the	O

Further	O

the	O
evidence	O

the	O

itself	O
destroys	O
the	O
so-called	O
conspiracy	O
hatched	O

because	O
the	O

However	O

let	O
us	O
consider	O
that	O

From	O
the	O

whether	O

in	O

for	O

transaction	O
developed	O
by	O
the	O

,	O
it	O
can	O
not	O

that	O

stated	O
above	O

this	O
irregular	O
practice	O
is	O
also	O
discussed	O
by	O
JPC	O

The	O
JPC	O
had	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
scrutiny	O
of	O
securities	O
transactions	O
in	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
banks	O
revealed	O
that	O
some	O
banks	O
were	O
even	O
handing	O
over	O
account	O
payee	O
cheques	O
drawn	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
other	O
banks	O
to	O
the	O
brokers	O
who	O
got	O
them	O
credited	O
to	O
their	O
account	O
ostensibly	O
to	O
assist	O
the	O
latter	O
in	O
transferring	O
the	O
funds	O
quickly	O
to	O
meet	O
their	O
obligations	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
done	O
as	O
per	O
informal	O
understanding	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
market	O
practice	O
.	O

The	O
payee	O
bank	O
used	O
to	O
credit	O
the	O
proceeds	O
to	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
the	O
brokers	O
constituents	O
who	O
brought	O
the	O
cheque	O
to	O
if	O
for	O
collection	O
.	O

The	O
JPC	O
also	O
observed	O
that	O
routing	O
of	O
transaction	O
of	O
many	O
brokers	O
including	O
A-5	O
had	O
been	O
carried	O
out	O
by	O
banks	O
.	O

The	O
banks	O
were	O
lending	O
their	O
names	O
to	O
the	O
transactions	O
of	O
these	O
brokers	O
and	O
exposed	O
themselves	O
to	O
great	O
risk	O
by	O
irregularly	O
issuing	O
their	O
own	O
BRs	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
commercial	O
practice	O
was	O
rightly	O
or	O
wrongly	O
developed	O
in	O
various	O
banks	O
or	O
the	O
PSUs	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
inferred	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
conspiracy	O
between	O
the	O
banks	O
and	O
PSUs	O
or	O
that	O
there	O
was	O

A-3	O

A-4	O

181	O

Further	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
evidence	O
on	O

Reading	O
