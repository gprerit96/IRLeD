Summing	O
up	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
with	O
confidence	O
that	O

is	O
not	O

compensation	B-LEG
for	O

the	O

but	O
pension	O
also	O
has	O
a	O
broader	O
significance	O

in	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
measure	O

One	O
such	O
saving	O
in	O

when	O
you	O

your	O

in	O
the	O

Thus	O
the	O
pension	O

a	O

is	O
earned	O
by	O
rendering	O
long	O

the	O
offences	O
are	O
different	O

The	O
rule	O
regarding	O
issue	O
estoppel	B-LEG
relates	O
to	O
admissibility	B-LEG
of	I-LEG
evidence	I-LEG
in	O

which	O
is	O
designed	O
to	O
up-set	O
a	O

The	O

on	O

of	O
Mr.	O

This	O
Court	O
has	O
time	O
and	O
again	O
explained	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
issue	O
estoppel	B-LEG
in	O
a	O
criminal	O
trial	O
observing	O
that	O
where	O
an	O
issue	O
of	O
fact	O
has	O
been	O
tried	O
by	O
a	O
competent	O
court	O
on	O
an	O
earlier	O
occasion	O
and	O
a	O
finding	O
has	O
been	O
recorded	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
finding	O
would	O
constitute	O
an	O
estoppel	B-LEG
or	O
res	O
judicata	O
against	O
the	O
prosecution	O
,	O
not	O
as	O
a	O
bar	O
to	O
the	O
trial	O
and	O
conviction	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O
for	O
a	O
different	O
or	O
distinct	B-LEG
offence	I-LEG
,	O
but	O
as	O
precluding	O
the	O
acceptance/reception	O
of	O
evidence	O
to	O
disturb	O
the	O
finding	O
of	O
fact	O
when	O
the	O
accused	O
is	O
tried	O
subsequently	O
for	O
a	O
different	O
offence	O
.	O

This	O
rule	O
is	O
distinct	O
from	O
the	O
doctrine	O
of	O
double	B-LEG
jeopardy	I-LEG
as	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
prevent	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
any	O
offence	O
but	O
only	O
precludes	O
the	O
evidence	O
being	O
led	O
to	O
prove	O
a	O
fact	O
in	O
issue	O
as	O
regards	O
which	O
evidence	O
has	O
already	O
been	O
led	O
and	O
a	O
specific	O
finding	O
has	O
been	O
recorded	O
at	O
an	O
earlier	O
criminal	O
trial	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
the	O
rule	O
relates	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
admissibility	B-LEG
of	I-LEG
evidence	I-LEG
which	O
is	O
designed	O
to	O
upset	O
a	O
finding	O
of	O
fact	O
recorded	O
by	O
a	O
competent	O
court	O
in	O
a	O
previous	O
trial	O
on	O
a	O

the	O

The	O
question	O
that	O
arises	O

whether	O

it	O

spoken	O
in	O

this	O

which	O
from	O

we	O
find	O

It	O
is	O
his	O

that	O
on	O
18.5.1988	O

i.e	O

3	O
days	O

the	O

A-1	O
met	O
the	O

at	O
the	O

where	O
deceased	O

PW-7	O
had	O
gone	O
and	O
A-1	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O

away	O
from	O
PW-7	O
which	O
distance	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PW-7	O
himself	O
is	O
about	O
500-700	O
meters	O
.	O

If	O
that	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
we	O
fail	O
to	O
understand	O
how	O
PW-7	O
could	O
have	O
really	O
overhead	O
the	O
conversation	O
between	O
the	O
deceased	O
and	O
A-1	O
.	O

At	O
any	O
rate	O
,	O
we	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O
High	O
Court	O
has	O
not	O
accepted	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
case	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
A-1	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
learned	O
counsel	O
appearing	O
for	O
the	O
appellant	O
had	O
very	O
seriously	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
evidence	O
led	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
recovery	O
of	O
knife	O
,	O
money	O
and	O
wrist-watch	O
is	O
so	O
artificial	O
that	O
the	O
same	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
accepted	O
by	O
any	O
reasonable	O
person	O
.	O

Having	O
perused	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PW-17	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Panchayatdars	O
for	O
recovery	O
and	O
the	O
Investigating	O
officer	O
,	O
PW-20	O
,	O
we	O
find	O
sufficient	O
force	O
in	O
this	O
argument	O
of	O
learned	O
counsel	O
for	O
the	O
appellant	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
shop	O
of	O
PW-17	O
is	O
about	O
1	O
1/2	O
kms	O
.	O

away	O
from	O
the	O
Police	O
Station	O
in	O
question	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
other	O
shops	O
and	O
houses	O
in-between	O
,	O
still	O
the	O
I.O	O
.	O

decided	O
to	O
specifically	O
look	O
for	O
and	O
get	O
PW-17	O
as	O
a	O
Panchayatdar	O
for	O
the	O
recovery	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PW-17	O
,	O
we	O
notice	O
that	O
undoubtedly	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
a	O
stock	O
witness	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
appearing	O
as	O
a	O
witness	O
for	O
recovery	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
even	O
as	O
far	O
back	O
as	O
the	O
year	O
1965	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
very	O
cautious	O
in	O
accepting	O
his	O
evidence	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
alleged	O
recovery	O
is	O
made	O
also	O
creates	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
doubt	O
in	O
our	O
mind	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
evidence	O
led	O
by	O
the	O
prosecution	O
that	O
at	O
every	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
accused	O
took	O
the	O
Panchayatdars	O
and	O
the	O
Police	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
prosecution	O
witnesses	O
themselves	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
thousands	O
of	O
people	O
present	O
witnessing	O
the	O
recovery	O
.	O

We	O
find	O
it	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
large	O
gathering	O
would	O
be	O
present	O
at	O
the	O
recovery	O
unless	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
had	O
already	O
come	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
a	O
recovery	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
currency	O
notes	O
were	O
allegedly	O
kept	O
in	O
a	O
damp	O
area	O
under	O
a	O
rock	O
also	O
creates	O
doubt	O
in	O
our	O
mind	O
since	O
no	O
prudent	O
man	O
would	O
conceal	O
currency	O
notes	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
place	O
.	O

Then	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
serious	O
doubt	O
about	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
stated	O
that	O
on	O
28.5.1988	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
in	O
question	O
was	O
recovered	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
hidden	O
and	O
was	O
seized	O

sealed	O
in	O
an	O

to	O
which	O
PWs.10	O
,	O

their	O

But	O
surprisingly	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
sealed	O
packet	O
was	O
opened	O
in	O
the	O
court	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
watch	O
was	O
wrapped	O
in	O
a	O
newspaper	O
dated	O
3.6.1988	O
-	O

when	O

his	O
inability	O
to	O

any	O

this	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
prosecution	O
through	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
PW-11	O
has	O
made	O
an	O
effort	O
to	O
explain	O
away	O
this	O
serious	O
infirmity	O
in	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
.	O

This	O
witness	O
says	O
that	O
the	O
sealed	O
packet	O
which	O
contained	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
was	O
opened	O
in	O
his	O
presence	O
on	O
15.6.1988	O
on	O
which	O
date	O
he	O
was	O
posted	O
as	O
a	O
Naib	O
Tehsildar	O
in	O
the	O
Tehsil	O
office	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
getting	O
the	O
watch	O
identified	O
by	O
PW-10	O
,	O
Dinesh	O

But	O
for	O
this	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O

which	O
was	O
sealed	O
on	O
28.5.1988	O
,	O
PWs.17	O

for	O

of	O
this	O
watch	O
in	O
the	O
newspaper	O
of	O
3.6.1988	O
.	O

If	O
that	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
we	O
fail	O
to	O
understand	O
what	O
evidentiary	B-LEG
value	I-LEG
can	O
be	O
attached	O
to	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
the	O
wrist	O

The	O
very	O
purpose	O
for	O
which	O
the	O

was	O

with	O

PWs.17	O

is	O
lost	O
by	O
the	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
prosecution	O
can	O
not	O
prove	O
that	O
the	O
wrist	O
watch	O
recovered	O
on	O
28.5.1988	O
at	O
the	O
instance	O
of	O

is	O
the	O

which	O
was	O

in	O

.	O

Our	O
suspicion	O
in	O

to	O
the	O
genuineness	O
of	O
the	O

gets	O
compounded	O
by	O
