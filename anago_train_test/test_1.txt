In	O

the	O
father	B-LEG

a	O
declaration	B-LEG

his	O

On	O

The	O
second	O
issue	O

which	O
has	O
been	O
ambitiously	O
projected	O
by	O
Mr.	O

is	O
that	O

On	O
a	O
perusal	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
learned	O
Additional	O
Solicitor	O
General	O
,	O
who	O
appears	O
for	O
the	O
appellant	O

contended	O
that	O
the	O
learned	O
Judge	O
of	O
the	O
Special	O

had	O
gone	O
far	O
beyond	O
the	O
scope	O
of	O
the	O
contempt	O
jurisdiction	O
,	O
particularly	O
when	O
the	O
Court	O
held	O
that	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
documents	O
produced	O
by	O
the	O
CMF	O
the	O

He	O
contended	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
this	O
nature	O
what	O
is	O
important	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
party	O
verifying	O
the	O
statement	O

should	O
be	O
doing	O
so	O

to	O
his	O

the	O

He	O
drew	O
our	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O

Judge	O
had	O
noticed	O
that	O
the	O

was	O

Subsequently	O
another	O
learned	O
Judge	O
who	O
tried	O
the	O
suit	O
of	O
CMF	O
held	O
that	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

such	O

it	O

The	O

that	O
requests	O
were	O

Civil	O
Officials	O
to	O
get	O
the	O

Though	O
the	O

refused	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
,	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
volatile	O
situation	O
,	O
a	O
decision	O
was	O
taken	O
to	O
move	O
the	O
train	O
out	O
of	O
Bareilly	O

According	O
to	O
the	O
Report	O
,	O
the	O
civil	O
and	O

officials	O
insisted	O
for	O
the	O
movement	O
of	O
the	O
train	O
as	O
quickly	O
as	O
possible	O
with	O
an	O
idea	O
to	O
disperse	O
the	O
crowd	O
.	O

One	O
may	O
accept	O
this	O
as	O
a	O
reasonable	O
and	O
proper	O
exercise	O
as	O
the	O
crowd	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
dispersed	O
which	O
had	O
congregated	O
in	O
Bareilly	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
does	O
not	O
explain	O

further	O
movement	O
of	O
the	O
train	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
60	O
KMs	O
from	O
Bareilly	O
Station	O

What	O
is	O
more	O
worrisome	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
train	O
was	O
running	O
at	O
a	O
speed	O
of	O
75	O
kilometers	O

Those	O
who	O
were	O
in	O

of	O
Railway	O
Administration	O
in	O
the	O
concerned	O
Divisions	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
sufficient	O
precaution	O

The	O
Administration	O
can	O
certainly	O
be	O
taken	O
to	O
be	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
Foot-Over	O
Bridges	O
or	O
any	O
structures	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
could	O
possibly	O
be	O
a	O
hindrance	O
and	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
such	O
incident	O
with	O
people	O
in	O
large	O
number	O
on	O
roof	O
top	O
.	O

The	O
Administration	O
alone	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
to	O
know	O
about	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
infringements	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
certain	O
structures	O
and	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
possible	O
implications	O
if	O
the	O
train	O
were	O
to	O
run	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
speed	O
with	O
large	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
on	O

be	O

We	O

that	O

They	O

therefore	O

argued	O
that	O

can	O
not	O
be	O

a	O

that	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
also	O
be	O
waived	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O
inasmuch	O
as	O
when	O

expressly	O
allowed	O
a	O

to	O
be	O

Referring	O
to	O
Article	O
18.3	O
of	O
the	O
PPA	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
argued	O
that	O
the	O
said	O
Article	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
substantive	O
provision	O
for	O
waiver	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
a	O
provision	O
dealing	O
with	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O

is	O
to	O
be	O
exercised	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
reference	O
only	O
to	O

Further	O
,	O
even	O
assuming	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

,	O
such	O
waiver	O
took	O
place	O
as	O
late	O
as	O
15.4.2013	O
when	O
the	O
last	O
communication	O
from	O
Uttarakhand	O

was	O
received	O

There	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
no	O
waiver	O
of	O
the	O
aforesaid	O
condition	O
on	O
31.3.2013	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
argued	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O
the	O
emails	O
exchanged	O
between	O
the	O
parties	O
would	O
show	O
that	O
the	O

all	O
the	O
other	O

had	O
in	O
fact	O
never	O
consented	O

31.3.2013	O
as	O
being	O
the	O
COD	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
PPA	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
argued	O
that	O
really	O
speaking	O
any	O
such	O
alleged	O
waiver	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
waiver	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
but	O
an	O
amendment	O
to	O
the	O
PPA	O
which	O
would	O
require	O
the	O
Commission	O
's	O
consent	B-LEG
Under	O
Article	O
18.1	O
,	O
inasmuch	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
affect	O
the	O
tariff	O
payable	O
by	O
consumers	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
argued	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
from	O
a	O
reading	O
of	O
a	O
chart	O
which	O
showed	O
generation	O
from	O
March	O
to	O
August	O
,	O
2013	O
that	O
Sasan	O
was	O
not	O
able	O

achieve	O
anywhere	O
near	O
95	O
%	O
of	O
contracted	O
capacity	O
until	O
16th	O
August	O
which	O
is	O
when	O
the	O
COD	O
took	O
place	O
on	O
facts	O

They	O
also	O
pointed	O
out	O
that	O
,	O
for	O

,	O
in	O
the	O
month	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

Ultimately	O

it	O

that	O
the	O

30.3.2013	O
was	O
a	O

so	O
that	O

could	O

that	O

for	O
what	O

in	O

for	O
electricity	O
supplied	O
under	O
the	O

the	O

in	O

procuring	O

at	O

It	O
was	O
the	O

who	O

as	O

as	O

For	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
relied	O

in	O

on	O
the	O
minutes	O
of	O

27.2.2013	O
between	O
the	O
procurers	O
and	O
Sasan	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O

unequivocally	O
stated	O
that	O

69	O

for	O
the	O

the	O
aforesaid	O

much	O
lower	O
than	O
what	O
the	O
procurers	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
pay	O
otherwise	O

It	O
was	O
their	O
argument	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
at	O
the	O
behest	O
of	O
the	O
procurers	O
themselves	O
that	O
the	O
COD	O
was	O
declared	O
on	O

They	O
further	O
argued	O
that	O

a	O

exchanged	O
between	O
the	O
parties	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

Countering	O

of	O
the	O

relied	O
upon	O
Section	O

of	O
the	O
Indian	O
Contract	O

1872	O
to	O

that	O

by	O
the	O

and	O
does	O
not	O

whatever	O
the	O
construction	O
of	O
Article	O
18.3	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O

exercised	O
in	O

that	O

also	O
met	O

The	O

a	O
Rule	O

What	O
is	O
important	O

note	O

is	O
that	O

the	O

All	O
that	O

that	O
